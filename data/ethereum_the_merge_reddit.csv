Ethereum fees could be trimmed by a hundred percent as an EIP 4844 upgrade is considered for inclusion,"Have you heard about the most anticipated upgrade to the ETH blockchain since the Merge activation on mainnet called EIP 4844 or Proto-danksharding?  


It's interesting because it is part of Ethereum's rollup-centric scaling roadmap, so many people started discussing how will this affect the price of gas fees, which is actually told that it would be pretty reduced thanks to this upgrade.  


We already are using L2 protocols for these issues. Which one do you use, and which is most helpful/suitable for you? I started with Polygon, but Metis suits me way more.  


What consequences can this upgrade have on L2 protocols?  


It actually reconsiders the data logistics on Ethereum's second-layer scaling solutions with roll-ups to make its usage 10-100x cheaper. Also, as it streamlines data processes, the implementation of Proto-danksharding is set to advance the throughput of the ETH mainnet.  


The exact timeline of EIP 4844 implementation is not known for now. Do you think it will actually occur?",268.0,2022-11-28 00:33:56,0.87
"Layer 2 solutions ZK Rollups, according to Vitalik Buterin, will be the foundation of Ethereum's go-to strategy in the near and mid-term future","We witnessed a watershed moment in cryptocurrency history with the completion of The Merge. The update is expected to increase adoption and reduce energy consumption, making it more environmentally friendly.  


Despite significant progress in recent years, scaling the Ethereum network remains difficult. Which L2 solutions do you use to address the issues presented by ETH?  


L2 solutions ZK Rollups will be the foundation of Ethereum's go-to strategy in the near and medium term, according to Vitalik Buterin. What are your thoughts on the subject?  


Working without Metis, Arbitum, Polygon, or any other long-standing L2 solution has become nearly impossible.  


Scalability is provided by the L2 chain, which allows for faster, cheaper transactions while retaining the primary security of the L1 chain. Protocols frequently use L2 to increase scalability by processing transactions off-chain and sending only essential data back to the mainnet. When trading derivatives, an L2 provides more leverage, more liquidity, and lower transaction costs than an L1. Users must be able to bridge back and forth from Ethereum without any lag or reliance on liquidity providers for it to be effective.

centralization of ETH,There is  concern around the centralization of ETH after the merge. Do you see it getting more decentralized in the future or not?,92.0,2022-11-17 21:17:39,0.62
Ethereum turns into first profitable blockchain from Top 10 of Crypto Market,"Prior to the Merge update and the continuous reduction in issuance, Ethereum, like any cryptocurrency network on the market, was the ""unprofitable"" blockchain. However, things have changed.   
 

It's important to note that a blockchain's ""profitability"" is not the same as a company's profitability in traditional finance. Technically, subtracting new issuance from fee burns allows us to determine whether or not the network is profitable.   
 

So, as far as I can tell, the blockchain's profitability benefits neither its holders nor new investors. Deflation, on the other hand, has the potential to be a significant speculative growth factor for cryptocurrency in the future.   
 

However, while the rallying Ethereum will benefit investors and traders, dApps users and developers will be forced to make transactions with higher fees and possible network congestion. Unfortunately, during high network loads, Ethereum requires users to pay up to $15 per network operation.   
 

I remember at the beginning it was quite chaos dealing with transactions and gas fees, I started using Metis from the start, and the discovery of L2 solutions was the greatest discovery for me as far as I can tell lol.    
 

Various foundations and projects, however, are constantly working on Ethereum's scalability by offering new mechanisms for processing transactions or alternative Layer 2 networks that take some of the load off the main network, offering higher throughput, shorter processing times, and low fees.",115.0,2022-11-17 15:47:42,0.88
"Which L2 protocol do you have the most trust in, and why?","We are all aware that, despite being the leading blockchain for developing decentralized apps, Ethereum is frequently chastised for high gas fees and slow transactions; even if the merger occurred, there are some things that should be done.  


Do you use any tools to help you deal with all of these ETH issues? Last week, I read an online article about Layer 2s, and there are a couple of great solutions, some of which I've tried and some of which I'm currently using, which is the scaling protocol Metis. It helps with all of these issues, such as high gas prices and slow transactions, which are, as previously stated, characteristics of ETH.  


Since I read about these protocols, solutions, and all the needed help with problems we're dealing with using ETH, I'd like to know a little bit more about it from your personal experience.  


Are you satisfied with the Merge after some time has passed? What did you expect, and did it meet your expectations? How do you deal with all of the other ETH issues that every holder/trader faces?  


I should mention that the Metis platform has a variety of use cases, including assisting users in developing their own NFT minting, yield farming, which I've been using as well, and DEX, which is fantastic, so there are some reasons why this platform appears trustworthy to me.

Ethereum's Layer 2 ecosystem is undeniably growing,"Ethereum is notorious for being prohibitively slow and costly. At the height of cryptocurrency's most recent hype cycle, something as simple as exchanging one token for another on the blockchain could have cost upwards of $40.  


It's no surprise that L2 protocols have grown in popularity, so there are layer 2 rollups for those who want to keep their transactions within the Ethereum ecosystem, and there's a reason why Metis and other L2 solutions have become so popular.  


Layer 2 rollups have special systems in place to ensure that transactions aren't spoofed or altered before being sent back to Ethereum's main chain, which is pretty cool.  


In what L2 protocol do you believe the most, and what fascinates you about it?  


Did you know that the total value locked in Ethereum's Layer 2 networks has surpassed $5 billion? Ethereum's Layer 2 ecosystem is undeniably growing.  


Although the Ethereum Merge was the second-most anticipated blockchain update this year, Ethereum supporters have long hoped that Layer 2 growth will help the ecosystem achieve mass adoption by lowering costs and making the network more accessible. While Ethereum mainnet continues to hold the majority of the crypto ecosystem's capital, with just under $32 billion locked up, Layer 2 appears to be catching up quickly.",47.0,2022-11-05 11:32:25,0.85
The reason gas prices have been declining for the past 4 quarters despite having over 100% gas usage,"####**The Enigma**

One interesting curiosity I've noticed is that **Ethereum gas prices have been falling 20-40% each quarter since EIP-1559 initiated DESPITE gas usage being over the 100% 15M target gas usage.**

This is surprising because normally under EIP-1559, if each block stays exactly at the 100% gas target, gas price will also stay exactly the same.

|**Date**|**Block Time**|**Blocks**|**Gas % used**|**Gas Price (Gwei)**|**Notes**|

####**So why is this happening?**

This counter-intuitive phenomenon can be explained by simple math. After EIP-1559, gas price changes whenever the previous block's gas usage deviates from 15M gas. It increases by 12.5% at 30M gas, and decreases by 12.5% at 0M gas. Any value between the 2 limits affects price proportionally up to 12.5%.

**So what happens if a 30M-gas block were followed by a 0M-gas block?**

    (x+a) * (x-a) = x^2 - a^2
    (1 + 0.125) * (1 - 0.125) = 98.4% => 2.6% price decrease

Thus if a 30M-gas block were followed by a 0M-gas block, the gas price would still fall 2.6% even though the average gas usage stays at 15M gas. The larger the volatility from the 15M-gas target, the larger the negative price pressure.

**In fact, in an extreme theoretical case where there were one full day of 30M-gas blocks followed by another full day of 0M-gas blocks, the gas price on the 3rd day would be 10^50 times smaller despite that the average usage between the 2 days was still 15M gas**. Obviously, validators will not magically be able to process transactions 10^50 times cheaper, so this is completely theoretical.

**Nevertheless, the effect is there, and we have been experiencing a 20-40% decrease in gas prices quarterly since EIP-1559 was introduced in Aug 2021. Though the decrease has slowed down since The Merge.**

A mix of these 2 cases will continue happening until a dynamic market equilibrium is reached:

1. Gas price keeps falling every quarter
1. Daily gas usage rises noticeably above its current 102% average. (Edit: I did some simulations afterwards. Gas usage actually remains around 102-103% of 15M when the price remains stable. So it's actually not as noticeable as I thought.)

------------------------

**Edit**: I thought about it more, and it does seem to either be a bug or a purposeful design flaw.

Let's say you have 3 fee changes of a, b, and c where the sum of all 3 is zero. You have to find a fee formula f(x) where the product, f(a) * f(b) * f(c) = 1.

So I figured out the correct formula is to use any exponential function. For example:

    a + b = -c
    e^a * e^b * e^c = e^a * e^b * e^(-a-b) = 1

I was going to report it, but looks like **someone else** already mentioned it a long time ago: https://ethresear.ch/t/make-eip-1559-more-like-an-amm-curve/9082/2

Guess they never bothered fixing it.

Pretty impressive how the ETH supply has been affected by the Merge: POS vs. POW -95.54% reduction in issuance so far ‼️,"Under POW around 253,000 (vs. 11,300 in POS) ETH would
have been issued and rewarded to miners. 

This mean a lot of things:

- Less selling pressure on the markets (miners need to partially sell their tokens to finance their operations)
- Better security against 51% attacks
- Easier way to even better decentralization and holders paying much less for security (BTC holders paid $37.25 / transaction, ETH holders earned $0.78 / transaction)

Question About Apparent Censorship,"
[This article is saying that 45% of Eth validators are complying with US sanctions](https://cointelegraph.com/news/45-of-eth-validators-now-complying-with-us-sanctions-labrys-ceo). This is concerning, because it's so soon after the merge, and it's very much something that people said could happen. 

Someone here said that the function of block proposing / construction was going to be separated out from validation, in such a way that the validator can't know in advance which transactions are included. How far away is that from being rolled out?

Are the lead devs talking about this or concerned about it? I really want to like Eth. It seems like it's come such a long way over the years, but this kind of censorship seems like a big deal, and something that could be come a big problem in the not so distant future.",94.0,2022-09-30 22:58:12,0.84
"PoW vs PoS $225,907,500 Savings So Far","Hello Redditors,

I was reviewing the status of Ethereum today after the merge, it's been 14 days and wanted to see how we are doing.

I was using [https://ultrasound.money/](https://ultrasound.money/) to check on the supply of Ethereum and compare supply before and after merge.

If we were still on PoW we would have produced 180,329 Ethereum. Since we moved to PoS we have produced 8,554 Ethereum instead.

Doing some math using today's prices, say $1300 per Ethereum.

180,329 \* 1300 = $237,027,700 (PoW production of Ethereum)

8,554     \* 1300 = $11,120,200   (PoS   production of Ethereum)

11,120,200  - 237,027,700 = - $225,907,500.

What this tells me is that since the merge, Ethereum would have normally produced an additional $225,907,500 to it's market cap, which is usually collected by miners and maybe sold on exchanges. That's only in 14 days.

This is massive with the current state of things.

I believe the next bull run is going to be massive when the supply actually starts going negative combined with stackers trying to stake more to get higher rewards, just like what we saw with miners fighting over GPUs pushing the price of GPUs to the moon, stackers will be fighting over Ethereum coins.

What are your thoughts? Did I make any mistakes or overlook something?

Nothing posted here is financial advice. This is only for entertainment purposes.

SEC claims the US govt has jurisdiction over all Ethereum network transactions now that ETH has transitioned to proof-of-stake & the majority of nodes being run are in the US. Do you think the SEC might eventually sue ETH like it did XRP for unlawfully issuing securities?,"Ethereum \[ETH\] has been one of the most-talked about cryptocurrencies over the past few weeks, with major updates like the Merge taking place. Apart from this, the network’s transition into proof-of-stake \[PoS\] has been fueling rumors about ETH being categorized as a security. Now, further strengthening this argument, the SEC in a lawsuit against crypto influencer Ian Balina claimed that ETH transactions automatically fall under the US government’s jurisdiction due to the majority of nodes being run in the country.

Balina was sued for allegedly offering unregistered tokens. He was caught in trouble after he failed to register his project as a security before rolling out an initial coin offering \[ICO\] in 2018. The crypto influencer outrightly denied these claims. However, the crypto community is currently speculating on SEC’s massive statement in the lawsuit. According to the 69th paragraph, the lawsuit stated that it had the right to sue Balina because the SEC had jurisdiction over the Ethereum network.

It was reported that a variety of U.S.-based investors participated in the Balina-curated investment pool. A network of Ethereum blockchain nodes further verified a number of ETH contributions. Due to this, the SEC stated,

“ETH contributors were validated by a network of nodes on the Ethereum blockchain, which are clustered more densely in the United States than in any other country. As a result, those transactions took place in the United States.”

Additionally, it should be noted that at present 42.56 percent or 3340 of the 7819 Ethereum nodes reside in the US.

**Will this statement take a toll on the Ethereum network?**

The Ethereum network has been dealing with immense backlash following the Merge. As mentioned earlier, some were suggesting that the network would fall under the SEC’s purview as it would now be considered a security. A few others on the other hand were taking digs at ETH’s level of decentralization.

Amidst all of this, the latest statement made by the SEC would be detrimental to the network. Even though several legal professionals noted that the complaint’s phrasing would have no legal significance, it would nevertheless be noticed.",109.0,2022-09-20 13:29:45,0.81

Expect at least a year before you start seeing lower gas. The merge won’t reduce gas fees but it’s the first step in doing so.,"A decent number of people were expecting gas fees to quickly and suddenly decrease right after the merge, but that is far from the truth.

Technically, moving to PoS does register a very tiny decrease in gas fees, but that change is basically negligible.  
The only thing that changes for now is energy consumption which will see a huge 99.9% decrease.

If you’re waiting for gas fees to become low, you’re going to have to wait at least a year from now until sharding gets implemented.

Even then, Ethereum itself won’t be cheap and never will if devs stick to the current roadmap.  
What Sharding will do is facilitate a groundwork for EVM compatible L2s to help scale Ethereum.  
And with enough time and upgrades down the line, L2s will basically become a part of Ethereum itself. They’ll be indistinguishable.

Implementing scalability into the Ethereum chain itself would have taken a lot more time, energy, and resources.  
Meanwhile, L2s have been doing this for a while and they have the facilities, flexibility, and infrastructure to keep developing better ways to scale Ethereum.

Ethereum would need to a lot more time to test out scalability since a ton of private funds are on the line. Meanwhile, an L2 like Polygon for example has been doing this for years and they even have the groundwork for it. They have an entire data availability scaling solution which is the entire focus of sharding in the first place.

Sharding is officially slated for mid 2023 but considering that mishaps and extra testing might be happening especially after the delays that we experienced with the merge, I’m expecting sharding to get rolled out at least end of 2023

But that’s okay because current L2s are already doing a great job honestly but sharding will be the nail in the coffin for any criticism regarding Ethereum and I’m here to see all of that unroll.",50.0,2022-09-18 15:13:56,0.71

**Frequently Asked Questions**

**Where's the best place to buy ETH?**

There are many centralized exchanges that support Ethereum. If you live in the US, the most popular exchanges are Coinbase, Gemeni and Kraken. Coinbase users can use Coinbase Pro for lower fees.

**When is Eth2 launching?**

Eth2 is a marketing term used to represent a number of updates to Ethereum. The Eth2 proof-of-stake chain first launched in December 2020. ""The Merge"", which is the event that will fully switch Ethereum's consensus to proof-of-stake, is estimated to be ready in early 2022, although there is no exact timeline. Other updates, such as data shards, will follow that update.

Visit [ethmerge.com](https://ethmerge.com/) to learn more about ""The Merge"".

**Do I need to do anything to update to Eth2? Will Eth2 create a new token?**

No, ETH holders *never* need to take any action to keep holding ETH. Ethereum users will be unaffected by the Eth2 upgrade. And the Eth2 updates will not create any new tokens.

**How can I stake my ETH?**

The best way to stake your ETH: by running your own validator.

* Running your own validator requires a modern computer and 32 ETH. Visit /r/ethstaker for more details

**Why are Ethereum transaction fees so high?**

Like most blockchains, Ethereum fees are determined by supply-and-demand. The large demand to use Ethereum has pushed transaction fees quite high (however, fees were just a few cents only 2 years ago). Fees are especially high during market volatility, and during NFT drops.

**What is being done to lower Ethereum transaction fees?**

Ethereum fees are reduced by using layer-2 rollups. Rollups are scaling solutions that allow for significantly cheaper transactions, while still maintaining Ethereum's security.

Additionally, Eth2's data shards will make rollups even cheaper.

While rollups are cutting-edge technology being actively developed, a number are already live on Ethereum mainnet. Visit [l2beat.com](https://l2beat.com/) to learn more about rollups.

**What's the best wallet for Ethereum?**

The most popular tool for using decentralized applications is Metamask. However, for security reasons, we recommend using a hardware wallet such as a Trezor or Ledger.

Ethereum APY reaches 6.15%+ on AAVE - a massive milestone in Crypto that can open the floodgate for institutional money in ETH and its ecosystem. Bullish flag for overall crypto! PERSPECTIVE,"ETH APY typically ranged from <1% (most of the time) to 1-2% often on AAVE but reaching 6.14% as of the time of writing this post is a pretty massive milestone!

That type of yield on the relatively most secured blockchain on a permission-less DeFi protocol (AAVE) can attract massive influx of institutional money. This was a big a reason for Solana's rise last year as institutions loved 6%+ yield on a well funded/ well backed project with stable and strong team. Now think about where Ethereum stands compared to Solana and what can a 6.15% APY unlock for it and its ecosystem. Merge itself is a big milestone for ETH but it is amazing to see that yield!

More power to ETH and its ecosystem. More power to entire Crypto universe!

GPU power post merge,"Good Evening!  Just a random question that popped into my head.

Pre-Merge and Post-Merge transactions: Can a transaction be completed just before and just after?,"For Ethereum users, will there need to be an update to hardware or software to interact with the new Beacon chain?


Ex. User with Hardware Wallet + Metamask 

Pre-merge moment (POW): User uses a DEX to Swap 1 ETH for DAI. 

Post-merge moment (POS): User uses a DEX to Swap DAI for 1 ETH. 


Does something need an update or is the ledger and Metamask just suddenly going to route the transaction to the new chain? 

Does the DEX code just run on the new chain automatically?",82.0,2022-09-07 12:23:42,0.95

**Frequently Asked Questions**

**Where's the best place to buy ETH?**

There are many centralized exchanges that support Ethereum. If you live in the US, the most popular exchanges are Coinbase, Gemeni and Kraken. Coinbase users can use Coinbase Pro for lower fees.

**When is Eth2 launching?**

Eth2 is a marketing term used to represent a number of updates to Ethereum. The Eth2 proof-of-stake chain first launched in December 2020. ""The Merge"", which is the event that will fully switch Ethereum's consensus to proof-of-stake, is estimated to be ready in early 2022, although there is no exact timeline. Other updates, such as data shards, will follow that update.

Visit [ethmerge.com](https://ethmerge.com/) to learn more about ""The Merge"".

**Do I need to do anything to update to Eth2? Will Eth2 create a new token?**

No, ETH holders *never* need to take any action to keep holding ETH. Ethereum users will be unaffected by the Eth2 upgrade. And the Eth2 updates will not create any new tokens.

**How can I stake my ETH?**

The best way to stake your ETH: by running your own validator.

* Running your own validator requires a modern computer and 32 ETH. Visit /r/ethstaker for more details

**Why are Ethereum transaction fees so high?**

Like most blockchains, Ethereum fees are determined by supply-and-demand. The large demand to use Ethereum has pushed transaction fees quite high (however, fees were just a few cents only 2 years ago). Fees are especially high during market volatility, and during NFT drops.

**What is being done to lower Ethereum transaction fees?**

Ethereum fees are reduced by using layer-2 rollups. Rollups are scaling solutions that allow for significantly cheaper transactions, while still maintaining Ethereum's security.

Additionally, Eth2's data shards will make rollups even cheaper.

While rollups are cutting-edge technology being actively developed, a number are already live on Ethereum mainnet. Visit [l2beat.com](https://l2beat.com/) to learn more about rollups.

**What's the best wallet for Ethereum?**

The most popular tool for using decentralized applications is Metamask. However, for security reasons, we recommend using a hardware wallet such as a Trezor or Ledger.

What is “data availability” and why is it the top priority for Ethereum’s development team right now? Let’s talk about it:,"# EDIT: I've previously posted about both the merge and Sharding. All of these subjects are related and intertwined so I would really suggest you give them a quick read

Objectively speaking, Ethereum by far has the top-tier ecosystem on the market with some of our favorite projects and dApps built on it.

However, Ethereum is also infamous for its high gas fees, slow transactions, and overall lack of scalability and efficiency.

One of the major reasons behind this problem is “data availability” or more precisely the lack of it.

In order to explain what “data availability” is, we first need to talk about Ethereum nodes and how and where they store data. We also need to discuss L2s a little bit so I’ll try to make this as easy as possible for the average Joe to understand.

# - What are Ethereum nodes?

Ethereum nodes are essentially a group of computers that keep a full and comprehensive record of every single activity that happens on the entire Ethereum blockchain.

This obviously takes up a HUGE amount of precious and expensive space and processing power which renders Ethereum quite inefficient.

The main issue here is that a lot of this stored data is not being used and will most likely never be used. But its still there non the less and will always be there even after merging and sharding are implemented.

# - What is data availability?

Data availability as a concept and practice is not something new. It has been around for a while. But things get complicated when blockchains are involved and thus this concept on Ethereum is still new and not fully implemented.

Data availability is the practice of storing data off of the operating system or network (in this case, the Ethereum blockchain) and only presenting the needed data at the needed time.

**Here’s a nice analogy:**

**Let’s say you work on a computer but that computer has so much data stored that it’s making it very slow and clunky in performance. You also realize that you don’t need ALL of the data at once yet you still want to keep that data just in case you ever needed it someday.**

**What you do is you end up storing said data on a designated computer or hard drive and only extract the information you need at the current moment thus relieving much of the strain on the computer you work on.**

Now, this process is a bit more complicated when blockchains and the billions of dollars of transactions and assets on them are involved because there should always be irrefutable evidence that the stored data is indeed there and isn’t being tampered with.

This is where L2s get involved.

# - How can L2s help with data availability?

After the merge is fully implemented and Sharding is introduced, L2s will gain a lot of extra throughput to process information and gain faster prover times.

As mentioned before, the Ethereum beacon chain itself won’t be scalable. This responsibility will fully lie on L2s some of which are already working on scaling solutions focused on data availability.

This is why I was focused on mentioning Polygon in all of my previous posts regarding the merge and sharding because they’re developing a data availability scaling solution (Polygon Avail) and they actually just released the testnet yesterday (it was part of the reason that made me compelled to write this post and explain the importance of data availability for the future of Ethereum

Scaling solutions like the one being developed by Polygon store all the massive counts of data off of the Ethereum chain and provide only the needed information at a given moment while still giving irrefutable proof that the entire compilation of the Ethereum database is indeed intact and untampered with.

# - Conclusion?

When we talk about dank sharding, we’re actually talking about multiple upgrades but the most important of them all is indeed data availability.

If Ethereum wants to stay secure and decentralized but also fix the scalability problem, then data availability should be the main focus (and it is).

I hope I was able to explain the importance of data availability in a way that the average Ethereum user can understand without getting into so much technical detail.

As per usual, I’d love your feedback in the comments and would happily answer any questions there as well!",74.0,2022-09-01 13:05:38,0.95
"To quote the Ethereum Foundation: “The Ethereum ecosystem is firmly aligned that Layer 2 scaling is the only way to solve the scalability trilemma while remaining decentralized and secure.""","I’ve been seeing a lot of people especially on subs like r/cc claim that “the merge will make L2s irrelevant” but this is simply NOT TRUE. In fact, the complete opposite is true and I think it’s a little ignorant not to learn about this and subsequently spread misinformation in the crypto space.

On the contrary to what these people believe, L2s will be the main focus for the Ethereum development team in the upcoming years as the merge happens and then dank sharding starts getting developed.

L2s won’t only be helping Ethereum scale its new beacon chain, they will literally become part of that chain down the line.

A lot of people are confusing merging with sharding and these two are not the same.The merge will not make gas on Ethereum cheaper, in fact, nothing will.

What the merge will do is significantly reduce power consumption (more than 99%) and pave the way for sharding which will in turn give a major boost of L2s and their throughput.Ethereum’s beacon chain will always be expensive to operate and will instead rely on L2s to handle the data.

In fact there are already scaling solutions being developed solely for that purpose most notable of which is Polygon Avail which will store data off chain and present only the data needed at the moment. This kind of scaling solution will drastically help with traffic and gas fees and will transform Ethereum into a much more efficient kind of blockchain.

So don’t go out thinking L2s will get phased out. Ethereum will rely on them heavily in the upcoming years.In fact Ethereum already relies a lot on L2s as I imagine the vast majority of us use them every single day.",432.0,2022-08-31 07:35:59,0.95

Mark Cuban counts himself among supporters of the upcoming Ethereum merge,"Billionaire Mark Cuban counts himself among supporters of the upcoming Ethereum “merge,” a highly anticipated upgrade for the blockchain that will dramatically reduce its ecological footprint.

“I’m a fan of the merge,” Cuban, a Shark Tank investor and owner of the Dallas Mavericks, tells Fortune. “I think the energy usage issue is important.”

Indeed, the merge—estimated to happen Sept. 15—will shift Ethereum from a proof-of-work consensus mechanism to proof of stake. Proof of work is an energy-intensive process that relies on miners to add new blocks and verify transactions, whereas proof of stake instead relies on a network of validators. In turn, once the merge happens, mining on Ethereum will be effectively eliminated, and its overall energy consumption is expected to decline by 99.9%.

That’s why Cuban said he sees the move to proof of stake as a positive.

“But it’s long term. I don’t \[know\] if and when it goes up,” he added.

Even still, “I think the applications to drive usage will be there,” Cuban said, adding that he remains super bullish on Ethereum.

When previously discussing his affinity for Ethereum, Cuban has repeatedly mentioned the network’s applications and use cases being a driver behind his support. Mainly, he’s talked about his interest in smart contracts—collections of code that execute a set of instructions on a blockchain. 

“What really changed everything was smart contracts,” he said in March 2021. “Smart contracts came along, and that created DeFi \[decentralized finance\] and NFTs \[or non-fungible tokens\]. That’s what changed the game. That’s what got me excited. That’s why it’s a lot like the internet.”

Cuban owns Ether, along with other cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and the meme-inspired Dogecoin. His portfolio also consists of a few NFTs and investments in blockchain companies, many related to bettering Ethereum.

The Ethereum Merge and everything after," 

 *The Ethereum Merge is by no means the final stage of Ethereum's journey. It's a crucial step but still won't help Ethereum scale right away. In a recent talk, founder Vitalik Buterin sketched the milestones and end goal. In short: 100 thousand transactions per second, without sacrificing decentralization.*

Buterin unfolded the Ethereum roadmap at a conference in Paris in July 2022. He claims the long-anticipated Merge will make Ethereum about 55% finished after the Merge is complete. So then what's left to do? The end goal is to dramatically increase capacity without ultimately turning Ethereum into a massive centralized database. This requires all sorts of crafty ways to compress data and outsource data storage away from the Beacon chain.

The Ethereum Merge is arguably the major milestone as it replaces Ethereum's 'engine': its consensus mechanism. On the surface, users will not spot the differences between before and after. We can think of the Merge as keeping the exterior of a car intact while replacing the combustion engine with an electric engine. No small feat!

All the steps that come after the Merge are less fundamental but no less important: they have to do with scalability. They ensure that Ethereum can process orders of magnitude more transactions. Those improvements have to do with revving up the engine.

## Phase 1: The Merge 

The Ethereum Merge has been in the works for about seven years. The upgrade is all about the switch from proof-of-work to proof-of-stake. The Beacon chain, which has been tested for almost two years, will be merged with the old Ethereum blockchain. Mining will no longer be a business model in the Ethereum ecosystem and so Ethereum post-Merge will consume 99%+ less energy than before.

Also, from an investor’s perspective, Ethereum will change. Instead of miners securing the network, it will rely on ETH owners locking up some of their ETH as collateral to earn staking yields. Staking Ether becomes like an ""internet bond"" with the lowest risk of all Layer 1s. We’re dealing with a fundamentally different ‘economy’ here. After the Merge, Ethereum will no longer be a ‘mine-and-dump economy’ but a ‘stake-and-hold economy’. Whereas miners have to sell sooner or later to pay their bills, stakers benefit from staking as many ETH as possible: after all, compounded interest makes one wealthy.

The reason that Ethereum proponents are calling Ether ""ultra-sound money"" is that Ether will probably become deflationary after the Merge. Until the Merge, the block reward for miners is about 13,000 Ether per day. After the Merge, the new amount of ETH drops to just 1,500 per day. This 90% reduction corresponds to roughly three Bitcoin halvings. Hence, this deflationary move is also called the triple halving. Subtract from that the roughly 8,000 ETH burned per day, and your back-of-the-napkin calculus will tell you that the amount of existing ETH will decrease by roughly 1-2% per year. 

## Phase 2: The Surge

No, the Surge is not about the expected rise in the price of Ethereum... It’s all about scaling. As Vitalik Buterin said in a July 2022 interview:

*""You can lose a billion dollars from a hack but you can also lose a billion from everybody needing to pay way higher fees than they have to.""*

Scaling of many orders of magnitude is essential if Ethereum wants to support a decentralized ‘world computer’ that supports thousands of apps *and* that is affordable to use.

When Surge? After a hopefully successful Merge, work on the Surge will begin. Completion of the Surge is expected in 2023 but of course, there are no guarantees. 

The letter S in the wordplay on Merge refers to Sharding: the parallel existence of 64 blockchains or shards. This divides the huge data load that Ethereum will face (and already faces). All this data can of course not be crammed onto a single blockchain, because no one would be able to run an Ethereum node anymore. So to avoid throwing decentralization out of the window, Ethereum has to divide and conquer.

Of all 64 shards, the Beacon Chain - as the name suggests - will be the one that other shards rely on. The Beacon chain is often compared to the highway and the other shards to side roads. That’s one way to visualize it, as it conveys the image of spreading the traffic load. But this comparison misses the point that the shards will most likely not process transactions. Instead, they are used to store transaction data. So a more apt comparison would be that of the Beacon chain as the production line of the factory and the shards as data warehouses (even though it’s still a possibility that some shards will get execution rights).

Despite being (mostly) ‘just’ data warehouses, the shard chains will offer big improvements to transactions per second when combined with rollups. This is where so-called Danksharding comes in.

**Danksharding**

A few technical approaches have been suggested to take data load away from the Beacon chain. The details still have to be fleshed out. Danksharding is now the most likely candidate: it’s named after the developer who proposed it (Dankrad).

Danksharding works with ""data availability sampling,"" a technique that allows nodes on Ethereum to verify large amounts of data by sampling only a few pieces. It’s an efficiency measure and it is well-suited for the rollup era. Rollups, like sidechains, take the pressure off Ethereum by performing transactions on a separate, layer 2 chain.

## Phase 3: The Verge 

The Verge will introduce Verkle trees, yet another means to scale with greater efficiency. In Buterin's view, the Verge is ""great for decentralization.""

Verkle trees are of course a pun on Merkle trees, which are already used in Bitcoin and Ethereum. Merkle trees are a tool for ensuring reliable encryption by turning blocks of information into long strings of code. By adding all transactions in a block and creating a fingerprint of the entire set, it allows you to verify whether a transaction is included in the block. Verkle trees, in other words, make it possible to store a large amount of data by showing a short proof of any piece of that data. So they make the process of proof efficient. In this way, Verkle trees are a powerful upgrade to Merkle proofs. They will allow users to be network validators without having to store large amounts of data on their hard drives. Keep it decentralized!

## Phase 4: The Purge

The Purge is about removing (""purging"") old data from the Ethereum blockchain. Again, this will alleviate the data storage requirements for users who want to be validators but who do not have hundreds of Terabytes available.

After the Purge, Ethereum clients will discard data older than a year. This should minimize chain clogging and allow many more transactions to be processed. Buterin expects Ethereum to process 100,000 transactions per second after the implementation of The Purge.

Ethereum devs will still have to figure out where all those old blockchain data will go. Even though they are ‘old’, they are still vital to all kinds of applications. Where do all those hundreds of terabytes of essential transaction data go? One option is Arweave, the protocol created with the explicit goal of making centuries-long data storage possible. Arweave already stores the entire blockchains of Solana and Avalanche.

## Phase 5: The Splurge

According to Vitalik, the Splurge is all about the ""fun stuff"". Let’s see what techniques the dev team will come up with to further scale and speed up the Ethereum ecosystem, without sacrificing decentralization. ",44.0,2022-08-23 08:48:59,0.91
Censorship and a potential fork (not powchain) after the Merge that may have serious consequences - summary,"There's a lot of confusion on this subject so I thought this would be worth posting.

After the merge, US based validators (PoS stakers) may be prevented from validating OFAC sanctioned transactions (e.g. tornadocash) if the US government decides so. Currently it is unclear whether this is the case. Anyone exposed to these sanctions will err on the side of caution to avoid jail time. Example - ethermine have been censoring TC sanctioned transactions for a week already (Bitfly who own ethermine will also be operating validators after the merge).

There is a very large portion of stake that would be exposed to these sanctions including some very large centralised actors such as Lido, Coinbase and Kraken. These 3 alone hold roughly 45% of all staked eth. There is not enough time for all of their stakes to exit the network due to the exit queue mechanism. If lido and coinbase both try to exit it would take about 2 months for all the validators to be removed from the list of validators. Until you're removed from the list you are expected to validate and are subject to penalties if you don't.

These validators will be forced to either 1. violate OFAC sanctions, 2. censor the transactions, or 3. abstain on blocks with sanctioned transactions. The board of Lido, Coinbase etc. are not going to prison for the good of Ethereum so we can safely rule out option 1 - despite what they may say on twitter.
If they take option 2 and censor, their stakes will get slashed (they lose 50% of their customer's funds) and their validators get kicked off the network.
If they take option 3 abstaining, they will also bleed out due to a penalty called inactivity leak, losing 50% of customer funds, and get kicked off. Inactivity leak is normally a very minor penalty, however if more than 33% of validators are inactive it gets much more severe (because this prevents block finality) and after 21 days, 50% of funds are lost and you are kicked off. Because so many validators will be exposed to the sanctions it is highly likely the severe leak penalty will be applied.

The 4th option is to fork into a censored ethereum chain. It is very likely that their customers will start screaming for this when they see their eth stakes melting due to penalties (slashing/leaking). Ok, so what you might ask, if they want to run off let them.

The problem is the stablecoins. If US validators fork off into censored-eth, the supply of USDC/USDT will have doubled, but Circle and Tether collateral has not. The stablecoin operators will have to choose a chain to support with their collateral. Unfortunately, it is again very likely that Circle, and probably Tether also, will opt to support the censored chain - this is because, as we all know, a lot of the money in the market comes from the USA. Stablecoin operators are already in the spotlight and they would likely see even more intense scrutiny if they were to instead support the uncensored chain. Both Circle and Tether are exposed to US law.

On whichever chain the stablecoin operators abandon, the entire defi system will immediately implode. Stables are used for collateral almost everywhere you look. They will become worthless on the chain they abandon.

Unfortunately the OFAC sanctions have come at the perfect time for this to be a problem It is too late to prevent this because of the exit queue system in place for validators, and the merge only being a month away. The only way to 100% guarantee this scenario does not play out is for the merge to be delayed again AND for Lido, coinbase and Kraken to voluntarily exit their stakes.
An issue with this is that their boards are legally obligated to act in the vests interests of their companies (and not their customers, or ethereum). Lido essentially shutting their business down flies directly in the face of this fiduciary obligation. It's hard to say how that will play out.

So we may be left with an uncensored eth that is in tatters because the stablecoins have abandoned that chain, and a censored chain that is essentially subject to the will of the US government - something Ethereum was specifically meant to avoid.

Right now the best thing we can do is look for ways to prevent this. I would start by campaigning for Lido etc to exit their stakes ASAP to prevent this situation. And unfortunately would ask the eth devs to push the merge back one last time for the greater good.",56.0,2022-08-21 02:39:39,0.74

"A follow-up to my “what is the merge” post. This time let’s discuss the next upgrade after merging, “The Surge”.","As with the merge, the surge has more than one step to it but we’re only really interested in one important thing which is Sharding

Now before we understand what Sharding is we have to understand why Ethereum is so expensive and slow to use in the first place.

I expect that a lot of users here already know how the Ethereum bidding system works so you can skip this one right away if you want to

&#x200B;

# - Why is Ethereum so inefficient?

Ethereum currently runs on PoW (proof of work) meaning that all transactions are proven to be real by miners that solve very complicated computational problems for a small fee of course.

You as a user would obviously want your transaction to go through fast but Ethereum is a very popular chain and there are a lot of people ahead of you. For you to try and “skip ahead” of them, you’ll basically “tip” the validators a little bit more than others, and boom! You become their priority. So basically its a bidding game. Whoever is willing to “tip” more gets their transaction validated faster.

&#x200B;

# - Why does the merge come before the surge?

Think of Ethereum as a long stretch of road that has one single lane. It works well sometimes but when it gets congested, IT GETS CONGESTED…

This is exactly why the merge comes before all other upgrades.

Developers realized that Ethereum has great demand and the “road”  they created(which represents the blockchain)  needs a ton of new fixes. But fixing this “road” means that traffic will come to a complete halt and so will hundreds of billions of dollars in assets.

Therefore they created a completely different “road” which is the beacon chain and that chain has the capacity to undergo upgrades and development without having to stop traffic.

&#x200B;

# - What is Sharding and how does it work?

What Sharding will do is the equivalent of creating many more lanes (64 to be exact) on a brand new created road (the Beacon chain).

Ethereum can only process around 15 transactions per second and has maxed out once at only around 16 TPS. So it’s safe to say that Ethereum isn’t the fastest of blockchains. So developers came up with Sharding as a solution.

Sharding is an algorithmic process of splitting a blockchain up into many smaller pieces and, well, shards with many of these pieces overlapping and working in parallel. It is executed in a way that will allow anyone to verify their shard and still 100% trust the rest of the blockchain.

&#x200B;

# - Initial plans for Sharding and how they changed

The plan initially was the implement Sharding on the entire Ethereum blockchain (this includes the EVM, data, smart contracts, account, and everything else on the chain). However, Vitalik and the rest of the developers decided that it would be a better idea to implement Sharding on the data alone. This is why ***rollups will take over scaling and not the blockchain itself***

&#x200B;

# - The importance of L2s for the future of Ethereum

As I mentioned in the previous section, plans for Sharding changed and the responsibilities of scalability now fall on L2s (rollups basically).

Scaling solutions like Optimism, Immutable X, Arbitrum, Loopring and many more do all of their computations and storage offchain and end up posting data back to Ethereum

Without getting into a lot of technical details, Sharding will basically put these scaling solutions on Steriods

I mentioned in my previous post that I am in fact biased towards Polygon and some people in the comments genuinely asked as to why. Here is exactly why I’m biased towards them (by the way this does not mean that I think other scaling solutions are bad. I’m fond of many other scaling solutions and I always invite competition)

The most important feature of Sharding is data availability.

Right now there are Ethereum nodes. They’re essentially a bunch of computers that keep a fully comprehensive record of the entire blockchain. As you can imagine, this takes up A TON of precious and expensive space for data.

Well, it just so happens that Polygon already has a solution for that in the form of Polygon Avail. No other scaling solution has their current technology in that sector.

What Polygon Avail essentially does is solve the problem of data availability by storing data offchain and presenting only the needed data when actually needed

It basically shows Ethereum proof that “yes, the entire data is safe and sound. Here is the small amount of data you need right now” without having to burden Ethereum with the massive amounts of data that most of it won’t be used and will slow down the Ethereum network.

Again, I think competition is an amazing thing to have especially in a tech market like this one so I support all scaling solutions but as I said, I personally think Polygon has an edge over others.

# - Some cool features that come with Sharding

This post is starting to get long so I’ll talk about one feature actually that I think is very cool but is also extremely important

Sharding will actually change the way that nodes are selected to validate each shard

I’ll throw in an example given by Vitalik.

Imagine there are 6,400 nodes and 64 Shards (the standard). Every time that a shard and a block need verification, the Beacon chain (new PoS chain) will select at random 100 nodes to validate a block and the same will happen for the next block and the one after that, and so on (all at random).

The cool and important thing about this all lies in security. An attacker will now find it much harder to attack the network because he will require a large portion of the network to do so and would need that for a much longer time now.

I hope this post was helpful and I’d love to answer any questions in the comments!

I enjoyed answering questions in the previous post and would love to make another post about the upgrade after the surge (the verge, or Merkle trees update) if it wins popular demand!",99.0,2022-08-12 16:18:43,0.9
"What is the Ethereum merge, what are its economic implications and what are its main risks and misconceptions?","Before we understand what the merge really is we first have to understand the difference between PoW and PoS and how Ethereum will transfer from the former to the latter.  
I’m assuming that the vast majority of users here understand this so you can skip this part if you want.

# - PoW and PoS

As of the writing of this post, Ethereum currently runs on PoW (proof of work). The main goal of the merge is for Ethereum to move over to PoS (proof of stake).

The main difference between these two is that with PoW the network is secured by miners that have to purchase and run Ethereum mining hardware. This model has proven to be extremely inefficient since miners have to consume electricity in order to issue new blocks. This is exactly why Ethereum is notorious for being slow and expensive.

With the PoS model, on the other hand, the network is secured by validators who instead stake ETH in order to validate network activity. With this model, power consumption decreases dramatically.

With PoS, the network becomes more efficient, more secure, and can start benefiting from further upgrades most prominent of which is Sharding (which will be mentioned later on)  


# - What is the “merge”?

When people talk about “the merge” they’re actually talking about two-step of which the actual merge is one of them.

The first step is launching the Beacon Chain which was already done successfully in December of 2020.

The main goal behind this was to be able to test a chain running in parallel with the already existing PoW network without causing any disruption.

Another reason for this was to give time for stakers to stake enough ETH to secure the new network when implementing the actual merge

The second step is what we call the marge and it's what everyone is talking about right now.

The merge is simply the act of merging the consensus layer of the Beacon chain with the EVM state of the Ethereum PoW chain.  


# - What happens when the merge is fully implemented?

For starters, the power consumption needed to execute transactions and everything else on Ethereum dramatically decreases from what it was with PoW.  
In fact, it will decrease by almost 99.95%.

This is great for multiple reasons:

Firstly this makes Ethereum ESG compliant which is great for institutions overall especially ones that are regulatory driven. This will most definitely help boost mainstream adoption since many more global institutions will start exploring the Web3 space.

Second of all, a lot of the environmentally driven critics will finally shut down their arguments about NFTs, DeFi, and all Ethereum activity overall ruining the planet.

Third and finally, the merge will open up the groundwork for new updates included in the Ethereum roadmap that all of which combined will improve Ethereum overall, most important of which is Sharding.  


# - Misconceptions about the merge and how Sharding is related to that

The merge on its own will not make Ethereum gas fees lower. In fact, NOTHING will make gas on the Ethereum chain itself lower.

The Ethereum roadmap is not working on lowering gas fees on the chain, but instead is working on improving and integrating rollups and L2s in order for THEM to help with gas fees and traffic overall.

The L2 wars are more competitive than ever before but I think this is good news for Ethereum overall because it rewards innovation and new tech. But I’m personally biased towards Polygon as of now.

Speaking of which, I still have no idea how people still fall for this misconception that L2s and scaling solutions will be irrelevant with “ETH 2.0” (which isn’t even a thing anymore) even though Vitalik himself talked about it at the Polygon ZK summit back in 2021 where he discussed the importance of rollups on Ethereum

Ever since then, we’ve seen a flurry of development in the rollup scene and most notably the ZK-rollup with the recently mentioned Polygon leading the way with their open source zkEVM.

They already have 8 multipurpose Ethereum scaling solutions all of which will become even more efficient with Sharding introduced.  


# - What is the main risk behind the merge?

Any upgrade to any new technology comes with risks. This isn’t “FUD”. These are simply very improbable yet still realistic scenarios that may compromise the security of the PoS network.

Right now the biggest concern is a DOS scenario.

Since validators are the ones that are securing the chain, the network can technically be in danger of something called Network In Denial of Service (DOS) where if the attacker can know exactly which proposer is next in line they can try to DOS said proposer and strip them of their slot. The transactions that come with this slot can now be picked up by the attacker.

This is a very improbable scenario and already has solutions most popular of which is SSLE. Its basically complicated cryptography that prevents the attacker from knowing which proposer is next in line

I hope this post clears up some misconceptions, questions, and concerns overall. I’d be happy to answer any questions in the comments.",339.0,2022-08-11 13:57:27,0.94

**Frequently Asked Questions**

**Where's the best place to buy ETH?**

There are many centralized exchanges that support Ethereum. If you live in the US, the most popular exchanges are Coinbase, Gemeni and Kraken. Coinbase users can use Coinbase Pro for lower fees.

**When is Eth2 launching?**

Eth2 is a marketing term used to represent a number of updates to Ethereum. The Eth2 proof-of-stake chain first launched in December 2020. ""The Merge"", which is the event that will fully switch Ethereum's consensus to proof-of-stake, is estimated to be ready in early 2022, although there is no exact timeline. Other updates, such as data shards, will follow that update.

Visit [ethmerge.com](https://ethmerge.com/) to learn more about ""The Merge"".

**Do I need to do anything to update to Eth2? Will Eth2 create a new token?**

No, ETH holders *never* need to take any action to keep holding ETH. Ethereum users will be unaffected by the Eth2 upgrade. And the Eth2 updates will not create any new tokens.

**How can I stake my ETH?**

The best way to stake your ETH: by running your own validator.

* Running your own validator requires a modern computer and 32 ETH. Visit /r/ethstaker for more details

**Why are Ethereum transaction fees so high?**

Like most blockchains, Ethereum fees are determined by supply-and-demand. The large demand to use Ethereum has pushed transaction fees quite high (however, fees were just a few cents only 2 years ago). Fees are especially high during market volatility, and during NFT drops.

**What is being done to lower Ethereum transaction fees?**

Ethereum fees are reduced by using layer-2 rollups. Rollups are scaling solutions that allow for significantly cheaper transactions, while still maintaining Ethereum's security.

Additionally, Eth2's data shards will make rollups even cheaper.

While rollups are cutting-edge technology being actively developed, a number are already live on Ethereum mainnet. Visit [l2beat.com](https://l2beat.com/) to learn more about rollups.

**What's the best wallet for Ethereum?**

The most popular tool for using decentralized applications is Metamask. However, for security reasons, we recommend using a hardware wallet such as a Trezor or Ledger.

"Will all Ethereum (based) tokens/projects instantly migrate to Ethereum 2, or will it be a rigorous process?","I'm curious as I've been staking all my ETH for a while now and with the merge consistently approaching I would like any bit of clarity as it popped into my mind recently.

"Merging and Sharding won’t make scaling solutions obsolete. On the contrary, they’ll give scaling solutions more value.","This is a very common misconception in the Ethereum space and it’s actually been addressed on multiple occasions for a while not. Yet, the nearer the merge will be happening the more I’m starting to see people comment about “scaling solutions being obsolete when ETH2.0 rolls out”.

First of all, ETH2.0 is not a thing anymore. Ethereum on its own will not scale. ETH gas fees will always be high and we should swallow that pill already.

Ethereum is following a rollup-centric roadmap that will give more advantages and leverage to L2s and NOT the Ethereum blockchain itself.

This is exactly why we’ve been seeing so much development recently in the L2 space especially with zero-knowledge.

ZkSync has had their zkEVM testnet out for months now. Although I think its very frustrating that its closed source. It literally defeats the whole purpose of a zkEVM.

Polygon has their zkEVM in development still right now but its the only open source zkEVM that I know of so far.

And we’re only getting started. The growth in the L2 and scalability game is growing exponentially each passing day.

If we keep up this pace, Ethereum will become unrecognizable. The gas fee issues will become entirely irrelevant and Ethereum critics will shut up.

This will all happen thanks to scaling solutions, not Ethereum itself.

Vitalik himself even expressed his support for L2s and said something along the lines of that Ethereum’s future relies entirely on scaling solutions and more specifically rollups.",64.0,2022-08-06 21:33:42,0.85
Technical questions around how validation will work under Danksharding," Hi all,  


I have some technical questions about danksharding and validation committees.

From this post on two-slot proposer-builder separation: [https://ethresear.ch/t/two-slot-proposer-builder-separation/10980](https://ethresear.ch/t/two-slot-proposer-builder-separation/10980), danksharding is meant to be a two-slot process, meaning (if I've understood it correctly) it will take two 8-second slots for the whole build-propose-verify-append process to be completed.

https://preview.redd.it/ilra7u7ajpf91.png?width=1162&format=png&auto=webp&s=58908e091f7da720e50bea2363c220e50feac1a4

With PBS, after the intermediate block deadline, we see the remaining 'N-1 committees' attest to the block body. My first questions:  
1. Is the committee size here still the same as that intended immediately post-Merge, i.e. 128 validators, or something else?  
2. What is N here? The whole validator set available divided by 128?  
3. These N-1 committees attest to the block body tying up to the block header. But do they also verify for data availability and transaction validity (i.e. check for validity proofs in the case of ZKRs, or raise fraud proofs in the case of ORs)?  


My next questions relate to this report: [https://members.delphidigital.io/reports/the-hitchhikers-guide-to-ethereum](https://members.delphidigital.io/reports/the-hitchhikers-guide-to-ethereum), and specifically, this image from it:  


https://preview.redd.it/jf4k0qucjpf91.png?width=3600&format=png&auto=webp&s=aa1842526b6b9dd1369c895b8a7ff623325028c9

(Image taken from section titled 'Danksharding – Honest Majority Validation'.)

My additional questions from the image:  
4. 1/32 of the whole validator set is assigned to attest to the data availability of the block in each slot, as there are 32 slots in an epoch. But with PBS, the block cycle now should take two slots! So is this incorrect? Or should it be something like 1/16 attesting every two slots?  
5. Is '1/32 of the validator set' meant to be the same as the 'N-1 committees', and these data availability checks happens at the same time as that process? Or is this data availability verification a separate process with different groups of validators that happens after the 'N-1 committee' attestation?  
6. Does the '1/32 of the validator set' also attest to the transaction validity of each block?   
7. Later in the same report it's stated that it's intended for the other full nodes (i.e. those not in the validation set) to do their own private data availability sampling. If so, will they \*\*also\*\* be doing their own transaction validity verifications? This may be trivial for validity proofs, but I expect it may be quite onerous for fraud proofs. How would this work in practice?",24.0,2022-08-04 14:34:18,0.94
📢 Prater Bellatrix Upgrade *tomorrow* & Sepolia Post-Merge Upgrade August 17 📢,"The Prater Beacon chain will upgrade tomorrow to get ready for The Merge with Goerli.

"Happy Birthday, Ethereum!","Today the second biggest cryptocurrency - Ethereum - celebrates its 7th birthday. What did those years look like?

Price-wise, Ethereum grew A LOT. From its all-time-low in 2015 of $0.432979 to its all-time-high of $4878 in 2021.

Technology-wise, Ethereum has pioneered the concept of a blockchain smart contract platform and built a strong foundation for many new projects.

Ethereum’s DeFi scene is the biggest one out there, with successful DApps bringing more awareness to the platform over the years. And let’s not forget artists that make millions of dollars by bringing their work to the blockchain via NFTs.

Fun fact, the co-founder of Ethereum, Vitalik Buterin, says that the project is now only 40% complete.

At the Ethereum Community Conference in Paris, he compared the network to its longtime rival, stating that “the difference between Bitcoin and Ethereum is that Bitcoiners consider Bitcoin to be 80% complete, but Ethereans consider Ethereum to be 40% complete.” And that Ethereum will reach 55% after a long-awaited merge, where it will shift from proof of work to proof of stake.

We wish them a successful merge and can’t wait to see the full potential of ETH!

I still see “ETH 2.0” being thrown around. It is just not a thing anymore. The Foundation has changed up the nomenclature and marketing surrounding the Ethereum roadmap.,"I’m surprised as to how many people are still confused about this. So here are some footnotes.Ethereum’s roadmap has a lot of upgrades but the most significant two will be merging and Sharding.

# 

# - Oh no! What will happen to my staked ETH?

Don’t worry about that. When the merge with beacon chain happens (Ethereum going from PoW to PoS which was originally marketed as ETH2.0) the number one priority will be enabling withdrawals. The merge happen anytime soon now, with withdrawals scheduled for \~6 months after the merge is fully complete

# 

# - Gas Concerns

Gas on Ethereum itself is never going to be cheap.  It is a reality that we have to live with.  In fact, lately gas has been about as cheap as it ever will be moving forward.

# - The Merge and Gas

It is a misconception that the merge will lower gas fees. It will not. I mean, block validation times will get reduced by around a second or so, but that will only have very minimal and irrelevant effects on gas prices.

# 

# - Sharding and Gas

Sharding, which was originally designed to reduce gas across the board, has been changed. The Ethereum roadmap is now fully layer-2 (more precisely rollup) centric, and with that danksharding will be the way forward.

Again, Ethereum itself won’t be affected by this. What Sharding will do however is drastically help L2s lower their already low gas fees even further.But that’s alright because Ethereum is fully adopting L2s and scaling solutions as part of the blockchain.

As a reaction to that, we’re starting to see a lot of funds and developments being applied by Ethereum scaling solutions. already seeing some scaling solutions like Polygon alone is already sitting on a massive arsenal of scaling solutions with 8 of them ready to scale Ethereum and an open source zkEVM on the way that will help Solidity developers benefit from Ethereum’s security and Polygon’s efficiency.

Sharding will most likely arrive and be fully implemented in 2023 - 2024 so hang in there. (This is considering that everything goes as planned and no delays happen, which is usually not the case).

&#x200B;

There will also be further network optimization planned down the line. All of them are designed for the goal of further reducing gas costs and making Ethereum a much more efficient network overall.",259.0,2022-07-29 16:12:23,0.86
"The Merge is just around the corner, how's everyone feeling?","Just to preface before the haters fly in, I own Ethereum and support the project, I am discussing the merge and going over consensus algos voicing my thoughts and opinions.

With the merge coming up there's been a ton of discussion about PoS, how will it work, what are the benefits, why did they swap, etc. PoS is a consensus system implemented to continue the scalability of Etherreum (you can find a million sources to explain it), I understand why the choice was made and respect it, but for the sake of discussion I wanted to talk about other consensus algos.

Proof of Work (PoW) is what Ethereum is currently using, the same as BTC. You mine the token, receive it, and do whatever you want. Wanna earn more tokens, spend more money on mining equipment to mine more tokens, pretty straight forward. The benefits are large holders would need to invest millions upon millions in equipment to hold a large market share. Not only this, PoW also has the possibility of mining invalid blocks which lead to a loss.

To keep it simple, PoS eliminates one of the biggest downsides to PoW which is the equipment expense. Obtain the token and stake it to receive more and support the network. The issue however, is that large holders may simply stake their Ethereum for as long as they want, controlling a large market share and reducing the rewards for everyone involved. The more people stake, the worse the rewards.

Aside from PoW and PoS, there's also other consensus algorithms like Analog's Proof-Of-Time (PoT) concept which uses a ranking score and time-based technology to validate their nodes. Potentially preventing hacks more efficiently than other mechanisms. Solanas Proof-Of-History (PoH) consensus that utilizes time stamps to validate events and transactions, and then hashing them to make inputs difficult to predict, etc.

The issues with other options of course are things like security of the network itself, the technology may be flawed, and of course, the lack of decentralization.

Regardless, I wanted to know what everyone thinks. Is PoS the best option for the merge? If so, then why? Could there have been another route Ethereum took to evolve? Let me know your opinions",315.0,2022-07-28 01:48:07,0.87

Buterin said the difference between Bitcoin and Ethereum is that Bitcoin is considered to be 80% complete in terms of development.
Ethereum, on the other hand, is considered to be only about 40% complete at the moment, which will increase post-merge.

**Frequently Asked Questions**

**Where's the best place to buy ETH?**

There are many centralized exchanges that support Ethereum. If you live in the US, the most popular exchanges are Coinbase, Gemeni and Kraken. Coinbase users can use Coinbase Pro for lower fees.

**When is Eth2 launching?**

Eth2 is a marketing term used to represent a number of updates to Ethereum. The Eth2 proof-of-stake chain first launched in December 2020. ""The Merge"", which is the event that will fully switch Ethereum's consensus to proof-of-stake, is estimated to be ready in early 2022, although there is no exact timeline. Other updates, such as data shards, will follow that update.

Visit [ethmerge.com](https://ethmerge.com/) to learn more about ""The Merge"".

**Do I need to do anything to update to Eth2? Will Eth2 create a new token?**

No, ETH holders *never* need to take any action to keep holding ETH. Ethereum users will be unaffected by the Eth2 upgrade. And the Eth2 updates will not create any new tokens.

**How can I stake my ETH?**

The best way to stake your ETH: by running your own validator.

* Running your own validator requires a modern computer and 32 ETH. Visit /r/ethstaker for more details

**Why are Ethereum transaction fees so high?**

Like most blockchains, Ethereum fees are determined by supply-and-demand. The large demand to use Ethereum has pushed transaction fees quite high (however, fees were just a few cents only 2 years ago). Fees are especially high during market volatility, and during NFT drops.

**What is being done to lower Ethereum transaction fees?**

Ethereum fees are reduced by using layer-2 rollups. Rollups are scaling solutions that allow for significantly cheaper transactions, while still maintaining Ethereum's security.

Additionally, Eth2's data shards will make rollups even cheaper.

While rollups are cutting-edge technology being actively developed, a number are already live on Ethereum mainnet. Visit [l2beat.com](https://l2beat.com/) to learn more about rollups.

**What's the best wallet for Ethereum?**

The most popular tool for using decentralized applications is Metamask. However, for security reasons, we recommend using a hardware wallet such as a Trezor or Ledger.

"Whoever has doubts about Ethereum’s future… calm down, it still has a ton of development on the way from merging to sharding to much more","Call me biased if you want but I don’t think any other blockchain is as consistent and safe as Ethereum especially when you take into consideration that it has the most diverse and rich ecosystem in the entire market.

The only people who have fears are the ones that still aren’t used to how the market moves in times like this, but the reality is that this might be one of the most bullish phases for Ethereum considering how much development is on the way.

The merge isn’t that far away right now and it will make Ethereum WAY more efficient with around 99% less energy consumption.

Sharding will come after that and will basically put all scaling solutions on steroids, especially ones that are ZK-based.

It's no wonder why so many L2s and scaling solutions are starting to shift towards ZK tech, a lot of them starting t develop some neat stuff. Polygon out of all been at the forefront of ZK development with more than $1 billion allocated just for that and even 4 ZK-based scaling solutions in their arsenal right now.

This will make gas fees a redundant issue and will make Ethereum unrecognizable. So if you’ve always liked Ethereum then you’re going to love it pretty soon.

Honestly, I’m just excited at everything that will roll out soon and couldn’t care less about any FUD I see anywhere.",787.0,2022-06-19 20:23:25,0.91

Are GPUs becoming more affordable due to Ethereum's upcoming merge?,"GPUs or Graphics Processing Units, which are mainly used to mine ethereum, are becoming less expensive. This is possible because the network plans to convert from a proof-of-work or PoW model to a proof-of-stake or PoS one.

 And rendering these computer parts completely worthless for all those mining ethereum.


Leveraging information from Tom's Hardware, CoinDesk found that the valuation for top GPU units on eBay had plummeted by 37 percent since May 2021, when Chinese officials announced a further ban on cryptocurrency mining in the nation.


However, the price decline has increased this year. Ethereum developers explore the PoS approach and the value of the second-largest cryptocurrency plummets.


On the online platform, the value of ten key GPU models fell by 7.4 percent in January, 9.5 percent in February, and 12 percent in March. According to Tristan Gerra, executive director and lead analyst for semiconductors at investment group Robert W. Baird, cryptocurrency mining accounts for around 35 percent of worldwide customer needs for GPUs. GPU miners ""are not truly investing in new hardware at the present time, since valuations have been significant for a while."" This was basically said by Joe Downie, chief marketing manager at hash power broker NiceHash. Instead, ""most of them are probably trying for when Ethereum shifts to PoS, to snap up the secondhand GPUs"" from people who will actually give up when the switch happens. Currently ETH moves closer to its new ecosystem, many Web 3.0 projects like Polygon, faith tribe, Tron and Theta will benefit as the web 3.0 ecosystem as whole will become more cost efficient. 


According to Haohao, a marketing representative from Xuxin Science and Technology, a firm that resells mining rigs in China, the situation in Ukraine reduced cryptocurrency prices in February. This condition makes mine less viable, and so GPU values fell even further.

 According to Haohao, approximately 20 percent to 30 percent of cryptocurrency mining hardware in China has been basically sold since the shutdown.",74.0,2022-06-01 18:18:36,0.79

Ethereum Beacon Chain experiences 7 block reorg: What’s going on?,"""This reorg is not an indicator of a flawed fork choice, but a non-trivial segmentation of updated vs out of date client software,"" said Preston Van Loon, a Core Ethereum developer.

On Wednesday, Ethereum's Beacon Chain underwent a seven-block reorganization, or reorg, ahead of the Merge, which is tentatively scheduled for August. 

According to Beacon Scan data, seven blocks from 3,887,075 to 3,887,081 were removed from the Beacon Chain on Wednesday between 08:55:23 and 08:56:35 am UTC. Ethereum is a transaction network similar to Tron and Concordium which is much faster than the Solana network.

The term ""reorg"" refers to an event in which a canonical chain block, such as the Beacon Chain, is knocked off the chain due to a competing block beating it out.

It could be the result of a malicious attack by a resourceful miner or a bug. In such cases, the chain may unintentionally fork or duplicate. 

On this occasion, developers believe that the problem is a result of circumstance rather than a serious flaw such as a security flaw or fundamental flaw, with a ""proposer boost fork"" being highlighted in particular. This is a method of selecting the next block in the blockchain in which specific proposers are given priority.

Core According to Ethereum developer Preston Van Loon, the reorg was caused by a ""non-trivial segmentation"" of new and old client node software and was not necessarily malicious. Vitalik Buterin, co-founder of Ethereum, called the theory a ""good hypothesis."" 
On Wednesday morning, Martin Köppelmann, co-founder of the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)-compatible Gnosis chain, was among the first to highlight the occurrence via Twitter, noting that it ""shows that the current attestation strategy of nodes should be reconsidered to hopefully result in a more stable chain! (proposals already exist)."" 

Van Loon tentatively attributed the reorg to the proposer boost fork, which had not yet been fully implemented, in response to Köppelmann:

“We suspect this is caused by the implementation of Proposer Boost fork choice has not fully rolled out to the network. This reorg is not an indicator of a flawed fork choice, but a non-trivial segmentation of updated vs out of date client software.”

“All of the details will be made public once we have a high degree of confidence regarding the root cause. Expect a post-mortem from the client development community!” he added.

Terence Tsao, another developer, echoed this hypothesis to his 11,900 Twitter followers earlier on Thursday, noting that the reorg appeared to be caused by ""boosted vs. non-boosted nodes in the network and the timing of a really late arriving block:"" 

""Given that the proposer boost is a non-binding change. Because of the asymmetry in the client release schedule, the roll-out occurred gradually. ""Not all nodes updated the proposer boost at the same time.""

Van Loon stated last week at the Permissionless conference that the Merge and switch to proof-of-stake (PoS) could happen in August ""if everything goes as planned."" 

While the reorganization is bound to raise concerns about the potential timeline, Van Loon and the other developers have yet to explain whether it will have any effect at all.",59.0,2022-05-26 19:51:55,0.74

Huge testing milestone for Ethereum: Ropsten testnet Merge set for June 8,"Merging Ropsten is a huge testing milestone towards Ethereum’s mainnet merge later this year,” said Preston Van Loon, an Ethereum core developer at Prysmatic Labs.

The Ethereum ecosystem is set for a “huge testing milestone” with the Ropsten testnet Merge set to be conducted on June 8.

According to the Merge testnets page on Github, Ethereum DevOps engineer Parathi Jayanathi submitted a pull request for the Ropsten testnet Merge configuration code on Monday, suggesting the implementation is ready to go.

Ropsten is one of several testnets created by the Ethereum Foundation in 2017 and which is currently maintained by the Geth developer team.

This specific testnet is seen as the best replication of the Ethereum Mainnet as it follows a similar network structure. This enables devs to conduct realistic deployment testing before making updates to the actual mainnet.

The Ropsten testnet Merge will see the proof-of-work network combined with a new proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus layer testnet, with its genesis set for May 30. It will simulate what will happen once the actual Merge between Ethereum and the Beacon Chain finally takes place and it becomes a PoS network.

Devs in the community have been posting their bullishness about the testnet news online. Preston Van Loon, an Ethereum core developer at Prysmatic Labs said that..

the only way the Ethereum would ever accomplish mainstream status is through this merge. Energy consumption will go down by 99% meaning that Ethereum will finally be able to experience mass mainstream adoption.,"Some people are really underestimating what this merge means exactly. A lot of people know that it will definitely drive consumption WAY lower, but not many realize that this means Ethereum is going one step forward towards attaining mainstream status.

Aside from the fact that retail companies are pushing all in for eco-friendliness, these companies can’t operate on Ethereum as long as it's PoW.

Of course, we still need to wait for sharding for Ethereum to actually start showing its real efficiency, but there are already enough scaling solutions to compensate for that in my opinion.

These scaling solutions and L2s aren’t playing. Polygon alone has already partnered with so many mainstream traditional companies like Ernst & Young, Dolce & Gabbana, Twitter, Instagram and most importantly Stripe which is a BIG step for crypto as a whole considering Stripe is the 6th largest Fintech company in the world and the 5th most used payment app in the US.

And the fact that this company is using Ethereum (even if it’s through an EVM chain like Polygon) insights a lot of hope that Ethereum is on the right path toward mainstream adoption.",508.0,2022-05-14 16:30:26,0.83

To any new comer. The merge will reduce energy consumption by a huge margin but won’t have a significant affect on gas fees. Sharding is what will reduce gas fees.,"
While a considerable number of users on the subreddit have been using Ethereum, L2s and sidechains for a while, there are also new comers joining everyday (niceeee).

I’m seeing a couple posts here and there about “how will the merge affect gas fees?” and comments about “should I sell my L2 and sidechain tokens?”

The answer is no. In fact, the merge will most probably drive more activity on the platform making traffic worse which might theoretically increase the demand on scaling solutions overall.

The end goal is to reach ETH2.0 which is a phenomenally more advanced version of the Ethereum we have now. But that will happen in slow steps and phases. Part of these steps is lowering energy consumption which is the whole idea behind the merge from PoW to PoS.

For now keep your L2 tokens and maybe even accumulate more to cash in on a decent profit. Personally I’m betting my money on Polygon. They already have the largest number of daily active users between all scaling solutions plus it kinda easiest to build on seeing that they already have 19,000 dApps onboard.

I also think Optimism might have a chance at making it big especially after the recent updates with the token release but I tend to lean more towards zk tech honestly cause I personally think it’s much more superior and has more potential for the long term.",130.0,2022-04-29 01:26:08,0.93

**Frequently Asked Questions**

**Where's the best place to buy ETH?**

There are many centralized exchanges that support Ethereum. If you live in the US, the most popular exchanges are Coinbase, Gemeni and Kraken. Coinbase users can use Coinbase Pro for lower fees.

**When is Eth2 launching?**

Eth2 is a marketing term used to represent a number of updates to Ethereum. The Eth2 proof-of-stake chain first launched in December 2020. ""The Merge"", which is the event that will fully switch Ethereum's consensus to proof-of-stake, is estimated to be ready in early 2022, although there is no exact timeline. Other updates, such as data shards, will follow that update.

Visit [ethmerge.com](https://ethmerge.com/) to learn more about ""The Merge"".

**Do I need to do anything to update to Eth2? Will Eth2 create a new token?**

No, ETH holders *never* need to take any action to keep holding ETH. Ethereum users will be unaffected by the Eth2 upgrade. And the Eth2 updates will not create any new tokens.

**How can I stake my ETH?**

There are two ways that you can stake your ETH: by running your own validator, or providing your ETH to a staking pool.

* Running your own validator requires a modern computer and 32 ETH. Visit /r/ethstaker for more details
* Staking pools accept any amount of ETH. We recommend [Lido](https://lido.fi/) or [StakeWise](https://stakewise.io/)

**Why are Ethereum transaction fees so high?**

Like most blockchains, Ethereum fees are determined by supply-and-demand. The large demand to use Ethereum has pushed transaction fees quite high (however, fees were just a few cents only 2 years ago). Fees are especially high during market volatility, and during NFT drops.

**What is being done to lower Ethereum transaction fees?**

Ethereum fees are reduced by using layer-2 rollups. Rollups are scaling solutions that allow for significantly cheaper transactions, while still maintaining Ethereum's security.

Additionally, Eth2's data shards will make rollups even cheaper.

While rollups are cutting-edge technology being actively developed, a number are already live on Ethereum mainnet. Visit [l2beat.com](https://l2beat.com/) to learn more about rollups.

**What's the best wallet for Ethereum?**

The most popular tool for using decentralized applications is Metamask. However, for security reasons, we recommend using a hardware wallet such as a Trezor or Ledger.

Ethereum One Step Closer To PoS After Implementation of First Shadow Fork,"Ethereum developers have announced the first successful implementation of a “shadow fork” on the network, which is a big step towards shifting the network to proof-of-stake.

The shadow fork creates a platform for ETH developers to run tests before the networks shift from PoW to PoS. The Ethereum network’s merge into PoS is expected to make the network faster, cheaper, and more environmentally friendly due to the high energy consumption required to run PoW. The merge is expected to be fully implemented in the second half of 2022. So, if you are confident that it will go through without a hitch, then you might consider adding some ETH to your portfolio.

Do you think it's truly a big deal?

the Merge is coming! a few things to expect,"Sharing [this thread](https://twitter.com/trent_vanepps/status/1508478499325202435?s=20&t=RQzPSM9y-R56aF0lAhcILQ) of Merge info so the community can get acquainted with what to expect in a few months.

1. Unburnt fees (aka tips) on the execution layer (EL) begin going each block's proposer - completely liquid on the EL. Over a typical week, this is \~14k ETH / $42mm
2. Due to the amount of work required to properly test and verify the Merge across all clients, Beacon Chain validator withdrawals of staked ETH are only expected to be included in the upgrade after (Shanghai). Work from [@ralexstokes](https://twitter.com/ralexstokes) has started [here](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4895)
3. Post-merge, blocks will arrive exactly every 12s. Today, they arrive in a poisson distribution around \~13s. For devs: do not assume \~13s blocktimes (eg. to calculate an interest rate) - please make sure to use timestamps.  More [here](http://blog.ethereum.org/2021/11/29/how-the-merge-impacts-app-layer/) from [@TimBeiko](https://twitter.com/TimBeiko)
4. **The Merge/ Proof of Stake will not reduce fees on mainnet**. Smaller block/ slot times do increase available blockspace, but not significantly. Av. blockspace is only one input which influences fees, the other being demand. Near-term scaling & lower fees will be on Layer 2s!
5. To any stakers: you should start running a local execution layer (EL) client ahead of the Merge. In the future, outsourcing this to third-party providers will open up stakers to slashing risk under the [Proof of Custody game](https://dankradfeist.de/ethereum/2021/09/30/proofs-of-custody.html)
6. The Merge will use accumulated difficulty (Total Terminal Difficulty) to trigger the PoW→PoS upgrade, instead of block height ""An attacker cld use a minority of hash power to build a malicious chain fork that wld satisfy the block height req"". more [here](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-3675#terminal-total-difficulty-vs-block-number)
7. At the Merge, the 2 ETH PoW block reward goes away. new issuance will only come from PoS validators proposing blocks (\~.025 ETH) or ""attesting"" aka voting on network state (\~.00002 ETH)  4.3% PoW issuance → .43% in PoS h/t [@litocoen](https://twitter.com/litocoen). Higher security w/ lower spend!
8. Running a node post-Merge does not require any ETH (and never has). This is an important part of Ethereum culture that should be accessible to all. (Staking independently - aka consensus activities - does require 32 ETH. With some providers, it may be lower than 32.",441.0,2022-03-31 15:31:17,0.96

Stuff /r/ethereum should know: Proof of Stake edition,"Poorly informed crypto-journalist articles are constantly coming out, and this brings more Proof-of-Stake related questions and discussions rehashing the same topics and same misconceptions. So here are a bunch of common questions/takes I see, boiled down in quick bullet points like I did in [my previous post](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/s8mnwb/a_collection_of_various_things_the_average/) that was more about Ethereum in general.

I plan on lazily linking this thread whenever I see those points being brought up, and I encourage everyone to do the same and correct me if I got anything wrong or suggest any addition.

## Wat merge?

A lot more info can be found on [ethmerge.com](https://ethmerge.com/) so I will keep this section light

* When the merge happens, Ethereum will be secured by Proof of Stake instead of Proof of Work.

* The Merge is not ""ETH 2.0"", there is no ETH 2.0, [it's an obsolete term.](https://blog.ethereum.org/2022/01/24/the-great-eth2-renaming/)

* **If you currently hold ETH, you don't need to do anything.** You will still hold the same amount of ETH after the merge, there is no ""ETH2 coin"", no need to migrate anything, etc. Everything sames exactly the same, only the consensus mechanism changes under the hood.

* It's called ""merge"" because it's about *merging* the Beacon Chain (*consensus layer*) with the current chain (*execution layer*) and ditching the proof of work part of the execution layer.

* If you don't know, ""consensus"" is just a fancy word for the goal of ordering transactions and getting some economic guarantee that this order won't change. Both PoW and PoS achieve consensus by different means:

  * PoW: ""It costs too much to mess up with the order of blocks, playing by the rules is more lucrative.""

  * PoS: ""It costs too much to mess up with the order of blocks, because if I do I'll lose all the money I put up as collateral.""

* Since it's only the consensus mechanism changing, **Proof of Stake by itself will not lower gas fees significantly**.

## Why merge?

* Lower security costs since there's less energy needed to achieve consensus.

  * For PoW you need miners to be able to *at least* cover all the hardware and energy they use otherwise no one will mine. This requires a big issuance that is quickly sold for fiat to pay the bills.
  
  * For PoS you just need to give some yield to stakers to make people want to deposit capital rather than just invest it elsewhere. No big bills to pay beyond an ordinary computer and an internet connection, so the yield just has to reflect the opportunity costs and risks involved.

* More sustainability:

  * The security of a blockchain is basically proportional to the value of its coin. This is true for both PoW (more valuable coin rewards = more reasons to play by the rules = more miners = harder to mess up the consensus) and PoS (more valuable staked coins = more reasons to play by the rules to avoid losing the staked coins)

  * A newly issued coin is essentially value being taken from all holders of the coin and being redistributed to someone. All else equal, selling that coin for fiat extracts value out of the network.

* It opens the door for many scaling solutions in the future, namely data sharding, statelessness, light clients, and [more](https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin/status/1466411377107558402)

* It helps reduce some complexity of the code going forward, by separating concerns between execution and consensus.

* Appeasing the environment and gamers is certainly a nice side-effect, but not really a major reason behind the switch to PoS, since it's mostly about externalities over which Ethereum as a protocol doesn't have much control (source of energy production, GPU supply chains, etc.)

## Wen merge?

* It happened on September 15th, 2022

## Nope, your a idiot. They will delay it like they always have in the past. They promised it years ago and still haven't delivered.

Believe or not this was a common talking point before the merge

## Those millions of ETH staked will crash the price the very moment they're unlocked LOL

For sure, there will be plenty of stakers who will want to finally take profit, especially those who locked their ETH back when 32 ETH was worth $10k. But there's plenty more to consider on the other side of the equation:

* The merge doesn't unlock any ETH. Withdrawals will come in the first hard fork following the merge, likely 6-8 months after. That's months of no proof of work issuance (~13k ETH/day) being sold off *and* no proof of stake issuance coming into circulation.

* Just like how there's a queue to deposit ETH, there will be [a queue to withdraw it.](https://github.com/ethereum/annotated-spec/blob/master/phase0/beacon-chain.md#how-does-eth2-proof-of-stake-work). Assuming a mass sell-off event, everyone is in that queue, limited at a rate of 1125 valitors per day. So there's no ""opening the floodgates"" moment. Everyone unstaking would literally take over a year. A year of ~38k ETH/day entering back into circulation (or... roughly 1% of average daily volume)

* After the merge, validators will start receiving fee rewards as well, doubling the yield [by some estimates](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1vrK5sY5ooq-F8dcyRhmmAJ5YtgkvWKWP3OfGCZIYxSA/edit#gid=0). There are thousands of people waiting in line to stake *right now*. They're okay with a 5% yield on their ETH, I don't think they're gonna yeet the moment it becomes 10% lol

* The biggest risk involved in staking is *by far* the merge. Something catastrophic could go wrong, yet people have been staking and locking up their ETH for over a year despite this risk and despite the ETH being locked until an unknown floating date. How many people/institutions are waiting on the sidelines for this risk to disappear before jumping in?

* And don't forget stakers exiting means fewer validators which means higher rewards for the stakers who don't exit. It also means more incentives for other people to *start* staking if they weren't before...

* But of course it's crypto, and crypto's gonna crypto. The merge will bring excitement and volatility and possibly a sell-the-news dip, who knows. I don't pretend to know the future, but the way I see it it's much more likely way more ETH will flow *into* staking than out of it.

## If proof of stake is so good, then how come Ethereum didn't go with that from the start?

* Proof of Work is easy to conceptualize and implement, Proof of Stake isn't. Especially when back in 2014 it was mostly a theoretical concept still being researched, with some blockchain implementing some version of it.

* There were several fundamental problems with PoS that needed to be overcome from a research perspective before thinking about implementing it. 

* There is no one-size-fits-all for Proof of Stake. Every PoS blockchain comes with its own PoS specification that has pros and cons on various aspects, so it's not as simple as ""but this other blockchain did it, why can't ethereum just do the same thing""

* Starting as a proof of work chain had the benefit of letting anyone mine coins on their own without anyone's permission, which helped the coin distribution become way better than those newer chains that are proof of stake from the start and have to decide how to allocate the initial coins, which can't really be done permissionlessly.

* Related to above: Yes, there was still a premine/presale for Ethereum, but it has now been diluted to half the supply after years of mining and multiple bull/bear cycles making that ETH swap hands, bringing the distribution [closer to Bitcoin's](https://medium.com/@adamscochran/the-10k-audit-42c100dd32bb). So it's not that big of a deal in 2022 when Ether as an asset is extremely liquid and easy to acquire. 

## Nah, this is really just a ploy to screw over the miners one last time after years of hard work

* PoS has been the eventual goal since [day 1](https://blog.ethereum.org/2014/07/22/launching-the-ether-sale/), everyone mining was always aware that it would end one day. There is no rugpull or unfairness going on here.

* Economic factors trump any kind of miner-blockchain loyalty. You can kinda view the blockchain as a business and the miners as employees:

  * Miners/employees have been paid for the service they provide (namely, secure consensus) with the block rewards. The paycheck is an expense for the employer and it comes from diluting the value of existing coins from holders (see above in ""why merge?"")

  * Miners go to the chain offering the highest rewards, most of them would ditch Ethereum in a heartbeat if another GPU minable coin gave out more rewards. 

  * Similarly, Ethereum will pay less for the service it requires if stakers can do it for way cheaper. 

* It's not entirely exclusive. Miners can also be holders of the coin, and users of the blockchain. Nothing prevents them from holding their rewards and becoming stakers too.

## The coin stops having inherent value if you're not spending real world energy to mine it

I don't really buy this argument. There is nothing magical about computing hashes over and over until you land on one that fits arbitrary requirements. I mean, you could have a proof of work blockchain where the work is done by solving sudoku puzzles and it would work exactly the same: NP-complete problem, hard to compute one way but easy to verify a solution once one has been found. That doesn't mean solving sudoku inherently brings value into the world. Cranking up the mining difficulty of a coin doesn't magically make everyone richer, it just makes mining less profitable – unless of course demand goes up too, which so far hasn't been too much of a problem in the crypto world.

The way I see it, the value of a coin ultimately comes from supply and demand, and the demand comes from how valuable the blockspace is. People need ETH to buy the blockspace, regardless of whether that ETH is generated by a miner or a staker. Sure, the more miners there are the higher the security/decentralization which further increases the value proposition of the blockspace in a positive feedback loop, but [feedback loops exist in Proof of Stake Ethereum too](https://i.imgur.com/3bPV35a.png) and they're super cool too!

## Proof of Stake is a recipe for total centralization

* It's basically the same as Proof of Work but slightly different. ""Better"" or ""worse"" really depends on your opinion. The way I see it, PoW is really just PoS with extra steps.

* Ethereum as a community values decentralization highly, any potential centralization vector is addressed by the research team to come up with ways to mitigate it, even if it's at the cost of other important stuff like scaling (e.g. keeping gas limits low so more nodes can participate in decentralization, even if that results in congestion and high fees)

* There **are** shortcomings currently, decentralization is a spectrum and a process and we're not there yet, and for the time being there are many centralization crutches that need to go away on the long term. That said, none of these crutches represent existential risks for the network, and for practically any ""it's centralized because X"" statement, there is an item on [the roadmap](https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin/status/1466411377107558402) addressing X. I personally find it much more fascinating to come up with a whole bunch of stuff to solve X rather than give up and say ""it can't be done because of X"". 

* Something interesting about Ethereum's PoS design that is often overlooked: Quadratic penalties. A single validator going down, messing up, or downright attacking the network doesn't get penalized very badly. A thousand validators doing it at the same time get penalized much more heavily. 

  * This means that if you're a megawhale with thousands of validators, it's in your own best interest to spread them out, avoid cloud hosting, use different clients, etc. Sure, the capital is still concentrated, but at least the points of failures are distributed which is good for the health of the network overall.

  * Compared to a big mining operation that relies on a central location to amortize costs, which can be spotted from energy usage and shut down if the authorities don't like it. It's hard to move mining equipment across the world, but staking only relies on private/public keys and not any actual hardware beyond a consumer grade computer.

## PoS is really just ""who has money makes more money""

* Yes. Unfortunately we live in a world of high wealth inequality. Blockchains don't fix that. 

* It's also true of proof of work: Whoever has money can buy more mining rigs and make more money. Except with mining, the ROI becomes better with economies of scale: Centralized mining operations have the big bucks to get bulk/discount rates on hardware and move to the places with cheap electricity. The solo miner simply can't realistically compete. With Proof of Stake, everyone earns the same yield proportionally, where they stake $10 or $10M.

* ""*They may be centralized, but those big mining operations have no reason to attack the network and weaken it since they dumped millions in infrastructure*""....... so you're saying you're fine with big centralized actors existing, as long as they have some kind of a big *stake* in the network?

## Passive interest on your deposit though? Printing money out of thin air? That's literally central banks and fiat part 2 electric boogaloo

* You have to really stretch it to make this case, but I've seen people do that lol. Those takes usually begin with ""proof of stake is nothing new""

* There's still ""work"" being done by validators: creating blocks and validating other blocks. It's just that the work done is composed entirely of the *actually useful work* that the blockchain needs to reach consensus, instead of computing hashes over and over again until one of them meets an arbitrary requirement. 

* It's not really ""free money being printed out of thin air"", there are still costs involved in staking capital, they're just more abstract and less direct than energy bills:

  * Opportunity costs – Why stake at all if another investment offers you a better yield?

  * Illiquidity – From the moment you deposit, your capital is locked up, queued up until your validator is active, then when you withdraw there is yet another queue before getting it back.

  * Inherent risks – It's still a fairly new thing, something could go wrong, there could be a critical bug, network could get attacked, your staking hardware could get compromised, etc.

  * Volatility – at the end of the day it's still a volatile asset, if you're the kind of investor who denominates their investments in their country's fiat currency, then a 5% yield on an asset that can drop 30% overnight isn't all that great (the upside of 5% yield on an asset that doubles is pretty great though, turn that 100% gain into 110%)

  * Maintenance – You still have to maintain and secure your validator, ensure 100% uptime, update software, etc. 

* Here's where it gets nifty: The more stakers there are, the lower the individual rewards get. This basically means that all those costs above will get priced by the market itself. It's easy to see why: If the staking yield is too low, then the rewards don't justify the costs and people will pull out and invest elsewhere, bringing the yield back up. Likewise if it's too high, that'll attract more capital and bring it back down. 

* As far as inflation goes: Let's say the market as a whole decides that 5% is the ideal yield, of which 3% comes from issuance. That works out to about 30 million ETH staked printing 900 thousand new ETH per year. At a total supply of 120 million ETH, that's an inflation rate of 0.75%. Which is outpaced by EIP1559 burn as long as gas fees are at least 23 gwei. (I cannot stress this enough: *Ether-the-asset will become a yield-bearing deflationary asset very soon*)

* ""*Nice math but there's no supply cap + they change the monetary policy all the time*"" 

  * The goal has been ""minimum viable issuance to secure the network"" for years, priorizing network security over an arbitrary supply cap.
  
  * No update to the monetary policy has ever increased supply inflation. Low inflation rate (specifically *dis*inflation) has been the goal since day 1.

  * There will be an equilibrium acting as an effective supply cap – decided again by market forces valuing Ethereum's blockspace – once the rate of EIP1559 burn matches the rate of issuance. That's super nifty if you ask me.

* So yeah, there's no ""central Ethereum bank"" adjusting rates arbitrarily and printing money to cronies. The market itself dictates how much inflation/deflation there is, no single entity can control it the way a central bank controls fiat inflation rates.

## Whales have all the money needed to take over and change the rules and slash honest stakers

* No. Ethereum has no on-chain governance of any kind for this reason. Protocol updates are a community effort (*Layer 0*) and you don't need any money staked to call out bad ideas and participate in the process.

* This is exactly the same as Proof of Work: Even if you have 99% of the hashpower, you can't make invalid transactions that steal people's money without their private keys, or change protocol rules, or really do anything beyond reorganizing blocks. The 1% of honest nodes will reject any block that don't follow the rules and you'll be mining on an invalid/useless chain. Now replace hashpower/mining with stake/staking and the same holds true for Proof of Stake (with the difference that someone caught reorganizing blocks will have their entire stake destroyed, whereas the blockchain can't exactly destroy mining rigs)

* And simply put, there is a fuckton of ETH involved. 10 million and counting and that's *before the merge*. At current prices that's roughly 30 billion dollars. Both ""amount of ETH staked"" and ""value of ETH"" are projected to go up, so attacks become increasingly unlikely due to the sheer economic cost involved in doing an attack — *once* — and the absurdity of acquiring that much ETH in the first place if the attack comes from an outside actor (where would you buy 10 million ETH to have 51% of the stake? 20M?)

## 32 ETH is way too much, the average person doesn't have that much

* I agree it's a lot. There are some ideas of how it could be lowered ([better signature aggregation](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/rwojtk/ama_we_are_the_efs_research_team_pt_7_07_january/hrmt6o0/) or [a rotating cap of active validators](https://ethresear.ch/t/simplified-active-validator-cap-and-rotation-proposal/9022)) but they don't seem to be very high on the priority list currently, as opposed to making sure the base layer is truly secure.

* The reason for such a high number is it has to fall in a technical sweetspot. In a nutshell, it has to be low enough to be accessible and have enough validators to secure the chain, but high enough to not have too many validators and bloat the chain with overhead. And having a fixed amount for each validator reduces a lot of the complexity by having each validator weighted exactly the same in the distributed randomness process of who gets to produce each block.

* There is a whole bunch of [math involved](https://thomasborgers.medium.com/ethereum-2-0-economic-review-1fc4a9b8c2d9) to arrive at 32 ETH from a technical standpoint, back when 32 ETH was worth about 7000 USD. [Earlier math from 2017](https://medium.com/@VitalikButerin/parametrizing-casper-the-decentralization-finality-time-overhead-tradeoff-3f2011672735) even suggested over 1000 ETH minimum. 

* Thankfully, just like mining pools exist, there are staking pools to allow staking in smaller amounts. It doesn't necessarily fly in the face of the ""not your keys not your coins"" mantra, thanks to things like [RocketPool](https://rocketpool.net/), [Secret Shared Validators](https://medium.com/coinmonks/secret-shared-validators-on-ethereum-2-0-ea29ab380016) (not yet launched) which use smart contracts to be permissionless, decentralized and non-custodian. And because of the quadratic penalties mentioned above, I believe decentralized staking operations will outperform the centralized ones on the long run. I recommend superphiz's [guide to staking](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethstaker/comments/t1xpr5/how_to_stake_on_ethereum_march_2022_edition/) for more info. And obviously, I admit staking through exchanges is yucky if you value decentralization

* Related to above, stuff like Rocket Pool is better viewed as a higher-level abstraction to base staking, rather than ""just a staking pool"". I go into more details on this [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/tijcq1/stuff_rethereum_should_know_proof_of_stake_edition/i1gd27b/?context=1) for those interested.

## PoS hasn't been proven, while we know PoW works

That's actually totally fair and there is no real rebuttal to this, obviously. Only time will tell. I just think it's irrelevant in the context that Ethereum *is* switching to PoS and was always going to. If you don't believe in it, don't participate/invest in it. I do personally believe in a long term sustainable PoS Ethereum, but even then I'm glad good ol' boring-by-design Bitcoin will be there chugging its proof of work along.

It's all part of the great crypto experiment of our lifetime. Either it's just a fad and will fail into obscurity, which would be a bummer for sure, or we'll have succeeded in creating monster robust networks capable of outlasting humanity. To achieve that, prioritizing decentralization is key. Which is something I mainly just see in Bitcoin and Ethereum, despite the widely different philosophies. It's why I'm glad to have both to truly see what's what on the long term.

**Frequently Asked Questions**

**Where's the best place to buy ETH?**

There are many centralized exchanges that support Ethereum. If you live in the US, the most popular exchanges are Coinbase, Gemeni and Kraken. Coinbase users can use Coinbase Pro for lower fees.

**When is Eth2 launching?**

Eth2 is a marketing term used to represent a number of updates to Ethereum. The Eth2 proof-of-stake chain first launched in December 2020. ""The Merge"", which is the event that will fully switch Ethereum's consensus to proof-of-stake, is estimated to be ready in early 2022, although there is no exact timeline. Other updates, such as data shards, will follow that update.

Visit [ethmerge.com](https://ethmerge.com/) to learn more about ""The Merge"".

**Do I need to do anything to update to Eth2? Will Eth2 create a new token?**

No, ETH holders *never* need to take any action to keep holding ETH. Ethereum users will be unaffected by the Eth2 upgrade. And the Eth2 updates will not create any new tokens.

**How can I stake my ETH?**

There are two ways that you can stake your ETH: by running your own validator, or providing your ETH to a staking pool.

* Running your own validator requires a modern computer and 32 ETH. Visit /r/ethstaker for more details
* Staking pools accept any amount of ETH. We recommend [Lido](https://lido.fi/) or [StakeWise](https://stakewise.io/)

**Why are Ethereum transaction fees so high?**

Like most blockchains, Ethereum fees are determined by supply-and-demand. The large demand to use Ethereum has pushed transaction fees quite high (however, fees were just a few cents only 2 years ago). Fees are especially high during market volatility, and during NFT drops.

**What is being done to lower Ethereum transaction fees?**

Ethereum fees are reduced by using layer-2 rollups. Rollups are scaling solutions that allow for significantly cheaper transactions, while still maintaining Ethereum's security.

Additionally, Eth2's data shards will make rollups even cheaper.

While rollups are cutting-edge technology being actively developed, a number are already live on Ethereum mainnet. Visit [l2beat.com](https://l2beat.com/) to learn more about rollups.

**What's the best wallet for Ethereum?**

The most popular tool for using decentralized applications is Metamask. However, for security reasons, we recommend using a hardware wallet such as a Trezor or Ledger.

The [REDACTED] ETHDenver 2022 Report,"The outlet for whom this article was intended got cold feet about running it, so here's my report on ETHDenver 2022...

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

The first ETHDenver was in 2018, deep in bear market doldrums. Hopium was lost. There was a whiff of vapor in the ware. Rumor has it that ETHDenver programming that year was just Gitcoin founder Kevin Owocki in a rented bufficorn costume offering bounties for free hugs to an empty auditorium. Even in those salad days of free-wheeling pre-COVID physical contact, few people accepted. Oh, how things have changed.

After surviving an existentially challenging bear market and a near apocalyptic pandemic only to emerge stronger than ever, the mood amongst ETHNerds at ETHDenver 2022 was buoyant, only a gentle caress short of euphoric. Over 20,000 applicants for an event that could comfortably have accommodated a tenth of that meant this year was always going to be an unprecedented clusterfuck. That sense of euphoria lasted only until attendees encountered the line to get in. ETHDenver’s (ostensibly noble) COVID test upon entry policy meant a three hour wait to get in as the line snaked down the block, across the street, and almost into adjacent time zones — all caked in a post-snowstorm slurry. And wait they did, in droves, and for days on end.  

That kind of excitement can only mean one thing. Lines for a COVID test. Lines for the elevator. Lines to get into talks. Lines for the bathroom. Lines *in* the bathroom. Crypto has two modes: Apocalypse and utopia. ETHDenver was firmly the latter. Self-flagellation is out. Self-congratulation is in. That’s because Web3 and DeFi and NFTs and DAOs have all achieved mainstream buzzword status, and none of those exists without Ethereum. You can tip people with ETH on Twitter. Fucky Zucky thought hijacking the metaverse could save his sinking ship. He must be sniffing metamine. Shit, Even Melania Trump bought her own NFT. And if Trump Org is grifting in your backyard, there’s gold in them hills. It’s a whole different kind of gold rush out here in Denver. 

The thing is that Ethereum tech actually works now. Well, sorta. It may cost $73 and take a few hours, but if you want to spend $23 million on a jpeg of a monkey – that utopian reality is yours for the making. Do you want to loan a derivative of a derivative of a derivative of a dog-themed meme coin? Sure! Just please don’t call it a derivative or the SEC will sue everyone. APY? In this economy?! Fuck that. What’s your yield by the *nanosecond*? Imagine your favorite, most esoteric MMORPG, but with the graphics of a 16-bit Animal Crossing. Sounds not bad, right? Now imagine it with a JPMorgan Lounge. That’s Metaverse, baby!   

At any crypto event, you’re gonna hear a heap of new lingo: Ponzinomics, POAP, danksharding, pussyverse, proto-shard data-blobs. Did you know that play-to-earn can solve poverty? That must have something to do with the Doge-wrapped McLaren parked in front of the Art Hotel. It was gone by day 3, so here’s hoping that someone vandalized it. 

It’s 4pm on a weekday in the Castle, in a cavernous side room shrouded in fog and laden with the rolling thud of house music. Countless exhausted future Bufficorns lay supine in beanbag chairs, staring at the canopy of lasers above them weaving cerulean and lavender spears. Excited groups of kids share shots of liquor. A one man dance party shuffles alone in the center of the room until a gaggle of girls bound into the space and join him. Is this a tech conference or a music festival? 

This could be the year that ETHDenver became SXSW for Crypto. It looks like the NFT gold rush has blown the space wide open culturally. The cool kids have arrived, and en masse. You can spot them because they share the same fashion aesthetic as a bored ape: animal prints, goofy sunglasses, glittering sequins, thousand yard stare. It’s too much for some, mostly the jaded blockchain marketing vets standing confused on the outskirts of all things, wondering how they haven’t downloaded Metamask mobile yet despite working in crypto for a half decade. They’ve spent a good portion of their careers slaving for ‘blockchain adoption,’ and now that it’s staring them in the face, they have no idea how to react other than slugging liquor for brunch, dazed,  mumbling to themselves about ConsenSys equity. 

Their energy is in stark contrast to the chillionaires, the very rich, very relaxed individuals with very few complaints about life. They’re the guys who bought hundreds of thousands of ETH at a fraction of a dollar. You can spot them because they’re wearing multiple rolexes on each arm, board shorts and flip flops, even in frigid-ass Denver. Nobody spots them faster than the bizdev shills, though, who are like guppies into the maw of these mega-whales. Here’s how you survive a hard sell from one of those desperate pitchmen who treat you like a microphone: smile and nod, smile and nod. Do not answer any of their rhetorical questions, because they’re all just hooks for another shill. Smile and nod. That’s how a thousandaire becomes a chillionaire.

While incredibly well socialized Ethereum developer Danny Ryan is on stage discussing semantic mismatches in the transition to Proof of Stake, the din from the reaches of the castle is deafening. Grizzled developers in newly spangled swag sweatshirts yuk it up with NFT obsessives in bedazzled leopard print, comparing shillhaul – which this year included free weed, USB lighters, and translucent metal sporks. Tiesto is in the building. The governor of Colorado just showed up. Vitalik’s mum is holding court. Someone dressed as Boba Fett saunters through the crowd. 

“The merge is really, actually very close,” Ryan exhorts over the noise. That gets everyone’s attention. Ethereum Maxis talk about the merge like Heaven’s Gate members talked about the comet. It’s the second coming of Jesus and Jobs and Jehovah alike. On the day the *don’t-call-it-ETH2.0* shards enliven, Vitalik will ride into the floor of the NYSE on a pale unicorn atop a rainbow that rains coins to save us all from our current reality: the one in which we’re already in a bear market and nobody except for VC Cunts and chillionaires have the wherewithal to admit it yet. 

Speaking of: Look to your left. Now look to your right. chances are that one of you is a VC cunt. The ‘VC’ stands for ‘very cunty.’ A message to your ilk from the rest of us: Take your billions of dollars, your fuckin’ social skills, your well-adjusted attachment styles, your consistent sleep habits, your workout routines, your pearly white teeth — and go copy/paste someone else’s Ponzi scheme! 

In the spirit of self-congratulation, ETH devs are here to PARTY. That means drinking enough alcohol to maintain eye contact! Woo! A fresh-faced, motor-mouthed young Web3 acolyte who works for a VC —  although he promises it’s not a cunty VC — has a salient piece of advice for anyone, but especially those in crypto: Never meet your idols. He encountered one of his at an ETHDenver afterparty, a guy ‘worth a quarter of a billion at least,’ languishing in a catatonic state, mumbling about ‘the best acid in Denver.’ Apparently, that did not fit his idea of a post-millennial tech baron. He’s learned better now. 

An interlude: What does a stablecoin have in common with a dominatrix? It’s all fun and games until you’re in too deep and they lose their peg. If it’s UST, you’re moving back into mom’s basement. If it’s your local Mistress, you’re going to the hospital. You’re fucked either way. 

Speaking of fucked: DAOs may be both the ‘new venture capital’ and the ‘next sovereign nations,’ but you may not get that vibe from the myriad DAOs that have proliferated in recent times — BluntDAO, PartyDAO, SporkDAO, SlutDAO, for example. DAOs may change the world yet, but not until they roll a blunt, have a boogie, get the munchies, and visit a sex worker — so just like most politicians, then. 

While an opera singer takes to the stage on the upper BUIDL floors for an impromptu performance, surprise guest Andrew Yang appears on the main stage. The room is packed and the audience listens on rapt. The wider crypto industry has been waiting on tenterhooks on the promise of a damaging Executive Order from President Joe Biden, and Yang has the inside scoop. He’s bullish on the EO, saying it won’t be as bad as many fear, but bearish on the long-term prospects of governmental meddling in the space. He says it’s a call to arms moment for the industry, and that we should all take it upon ourselves to fight back. He suggests gamifying lobbying, which actually sounds like a pretty good idea. 

All of this isn’t to distract from the main point here: a conference with all the Etherati in one place is totally against the ethos of decentralization. Single point of failure! That’s blockchain 101. What happens if one disgruntled Solana dev sneaks into the Castle with a bomb strapped to his back? They are capable of this. Those guys blow up their own chain on a monthly basis.

The real stuff at ETHDenver is on the upper floors of the Castle, where the devs have been at work hackathoning away since before the hordes arrived, and where they remained when the hordes left. Developers are more mythical beast than the bufficorn could ever be, and here’s where you find those rare creatures in their habitat, buried deep behind the hype machines and money printers. Rows and rows of people, heads down, headphones on. This is the actual source of the substance of the event, the whole industry even. Shit, maybe even the whole world. Every so often, they take breaks to eat stale pizza and play DDR and Mario kart in the arcade, drum and bass blasting all the while. It’s on these floors that  you’ll find anything resembling solace in the chaos. 

ETHDenver is a place where the developers who build the stuff, the shills who sell it, the storytellers who narrate it, and now the consumers who actually use it are all there under one roof. Yeah, it’s disorganized, but this is the kind of chaos from whence *stuff* happens. When things get organized, they get lame. ETHDenver is the Birthplace of BUIDL, and it retains that accolade. Sure, 20,000 applicants and only about 150 hackathon projects offers a ratio of about 1 in 20 builders to shillers, but that’s pretty fucking good for crypto. Your average Bitcoin conference is just a mass congregation of undersexed sociopaths yelling past each other about Wikipedia-level macroeconomics. In comparison, ETHDenver is a wellspring of substance and positive energy. 

Unfortunately the price of ETH did not mirror the buoyancy of the energy of ETHDenver, dropping over 15% over the course of the week. But nobody talked about markets or asset prices, even as they dropped precipitously and consistently all weekend. There’s something beautiful about that. ETHDenver envisions itself as a builder of culture for Ethereum, decentralization, and the creation of value in communities, and it does come good on that promise. 

There’s two surefire ways to know when a party is over. The first is when you receive a COVID exposure notification from the exclusive afterparty the night prior. The second is when fuckin’ Diplo shows up. Both happened on Sunday night. The Denver airport was apparently like an Ethereum transaction mempool on Sunday night, so most of you are using the same criteria for figuring out when it’s time to GTFO. ",102.0,2022-02-23 16:20:25,0.94
"If you think NFTs are useless, you're wrong! Here's why (prove me wrong)","I always find it funny that people are so quick to call NFTs a scam when it's a space that is so new and still finding its feet in Web 3,0. Funnily enough, it's always towards the trading component and never about use cases outside of this niche within the space. Usually, because they have no idea of the other utility that's being created and built.

It's undeniable that the list of use cases will continue to grow and they will become part of our lives over time. Some of the below are either happening now or will eventually become tangible in 2022-23.

**Vertical Marketplaces**

NFT projects will shift towards DTC marketplaces like larvalabs and SolanaMBS. Managing user experience is critical for retention, and eliminating 3rd parties doesn’t hurt.

**Soulbound NFT's**

NFTs are lauded for their transferability, but there are many use cases for non-transferable tokens: driver’s licenses, diplomas, certifications, proof of attendance, etc. Soulbound NFTs lock-in provenance, and can not be sold.

**Retail Sector**

Retailers from 7-11 to Gamestop will use NFTs to incentivize IRL transactions, leveraging creators to drive traffic to storefronts. For example, Yeezy NFTs that airdrop with purchases from Gap stores, or NFTs that unlock exclusive features for Tesla vehicles.

**Borrowing Platforms**

Because NFTs can unlock temporary access—like entry to conferences—markets for short-term lending are emerging. Imagine this as a marketplace: StubHub, but for NFTs.

**NFT Indexes**

Getting exposure to hundreds of NFTs via indexes will boom as market movers tap collectors for funds. Imagine a Christie’s NFT ETF. They have the influence to get assets to liquidity—investors will ape into that. It will also broaden support for NFT communities.

**Bounties**

Creators and brands will drop unique quests within communities, rewarding completion with NFTs. This could be anything from completing a questionnaire to referring members into the community, to attending events. Bounties can be highly competitive, or open wide.

**Social Investing**

Web3 streamlines investing by reducing manual processes like spreadsheet mgmt + signature collection. It also acts as a social record—startups like PartyRound will build networks around such activity, and reinforce them with NFTs.

**Legal**

The benefits of block security and its ability to trigger transactions via oracles will accelerate the adoption of web3 legal services + contract development. A DocuSign killer (or acquisition target) will be built in 2022, and it will deliver NFTs to contract executors.

**Services**

NFTs will unlock access to services and hobbyist communities. Q&As and tutorials with influencer chefs, photographers, doctors, and niche enthusiastic communities will boom. This will also extend into IRL services like transportation, hotels, and spas.

**Content Submission**

Users will submit content like short-form videos, reviews, and tutorials in exchange for NFTs. It’s a marketing flywheel. Rights can be programmed into contracts so that the use of the contributor’s content in advertising could yield their future profits.

**Activism**

Communities, where NFT ownership supports political causes, will gain traction as millions flow into community wallets. Imagine environmental NFT collectives where sales are directed towards lobbying efforts, and those efforts are coordinated by a community DAO.

**Social Feed Marketplaces**

Social feeds based on NFT collections will emerge, providing insight into the strategy of top collectors, and a platform for collectors to interact. These feeds will evolve into social commerce marketplaces, featuring reviews, analytics, and more.

**Multiplayer**

NFTs will create hive activity by incentivizing group behavior. MMORPGs that unlock levels once 10k users have aped in. Airdrops of rare NFTs to collector cohorts that have signed contracts to merge their base-layer NFTs. Collecting is going to become a team sport.

**Collateralization**

To date, lenders have been averse to NFT holders borrowing against their assets. But as institutional money flows in, and assets become better stores of value, collateral markets will promise flexibility and liquidity for all NFT holders, not just whales.

**Fractionalization**

Splitting up NFTs into individual shares gives more people exposure to blue-chip assets, like owning a piece of a CryptoPunk. The result? More liquidity for holders and more appreciation of blue-chip assets as money enters the markets.

**DeFi**

As enthusiasts become more comfortable staking and farming their holdings for yield, NFTs promise incentives beyond APY%. NFTs will become base DeFi assets, with community access included. These won't be simple savings plays—they'll also be investments in communities.

**Loyalty Exchanges**

As brands and creators seek to reinforce loyalty, community behavior will be rewarded with NFTs. Did the member contribute content? NFT. Complete surveys? NFT. Make a purchase? NFT. Tokens are more liquid and bragworthy than traditional discount codes.

**R&D**

Brands and creators will exchange NFTs for insights on product development: pain points, marketing claims, roadmap, and more. The NFTs will unlock early access to product releases and potential profit sharing. Brands will track and maintain these key relationships.

**Customer Cohort NFTs**

Imagine receiving an NFT for being one of the first Air Jordan customers, and how valuable that would be today. How Nike might reward you years later with special access and product. Cohort NFTs prove that you took a certain action, at a certain time.

**Education and Customer Support**

Upon demonstrating exceptional knowledge of a brand’s product, users can receive NFTs in exchange for onboarding newbies into the community, or providing support. This can be exponentially more impactful than a brand employee doing the same.

**Leaderboards**

NFT communities will gamify by highlighting the performance and participation of top holders. Top contributors will receive rewards and clout, thereby incentivizing communities to hold and participate in order to secure better returns on their investments.

\-------------------------------------------------------------

Take a second to actually look past the BS in the space and see that there is huge potential. #WAGMI

**Frequently Asked Questions**

**Where's the best place to buy ETH?**

There are many centralized exchanges that support Ethereum. If you live in the US, the most popular exchanges are Coinbase, Gemeni and Kraken. Coinbase users can use Coinbase Pro for lower fees.

**When is Eth2 launching?**

Eth2 is a marketing term used to represent a number of updates to Ethereum. The Eth2 proof-of-stake chain first launched in December 2020. ""The Merge"", which is the event that will fully switch Ethereum's consensus to proof-of-stake, is estimated to be ready in early 2022, although there is no exact timeline. Other updates, such as data shards, will follow that update.

Visit [ethmerge.com](https://ethmerge.com/) to learn more about ""The Merge"".

**Do I need to do anything to update to Eth2? Will Eth2 create a new token?**

No, ETH holders *never* need to take any action to keep holding ETH. Ethereum users will be unaffected by the Eth2 upgrade. And the Eth2 updates will not create any new tokens.

**How can I stake my ETH?**

There are two ways that you can stake your ETH: by running your own validator, or providing your ETH to a staking pool.

* Running your own validator requires a modern computer and 32 ETH. Visit /r/ethstaker for more details
* Staking pools accept any amount of ETH. We recommend [Lido](https://lido.fi/) or [StakeWise](https://stakewise.io/)

**Why are Ethereum transaction fees so high?**

Like most blockchains, Ethereum fees are determined by supply-and-demand. The large demand to use Ethereum has pushed transaction fees quite high (however, fees were just a few cents only 2 years ago). Fees are especially high during market volatility, and during NFT drops.

**What is being done to lower Ethereum transaction fees?**

Ethereum fees are reduced by using layer-2 rollups. Rollups are scaling solutions that allow for significantly cheaper transactions, while still maintaining Ethereum's security.

Additionally, Eth2's data shards will make rollups even cheaper.

While rollups are cutting-edge technology being actively developed, a number are already live on Ethereum mainnet. Visit [l2beat.com](https://l2beat.com/) to learn more about rollups.

**What's the best wallet for Ethereum?**

The most popular tool for using decentralized applications is Metamask. However, for security reasons, we recommend using a hardware wallet such as a Trezor or Ledger.

Potential Merge Release Target: Mid June (This is not a finalized date),"There was a [CL call earlier](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bi2qZ2epaPM) where a potential target for the Merge going live was discussed: Mid June. I wanted to jump ahead of the inevitable misinformation claiming this is a hard-set date.

&#x200B;

**At this point**, there is hope that a V2 of [Kintsugi testnet](https://kintsugi.themerge.dev/) will be released in about 2-3 weeks. From there, client code completion is hoped in March with the a release shortly after of a 'finalized' testnet.  If that testnet goes well, a mainnet launch in June should be doable, getting in front of the currently scheduled difficulty bomb that would render Ethereum useless mid-end July if not delayed.

&#x200B;

# Things to understand:

1. This is an **ESTIMATION** based on the current state and understanding. There is nothing that would prevent further issues to arise that could delay this. It is very possible a severe vulnerability is discovered, a bug requiring re-architecture of certain mechanisms, or many other issues could arise.  If they do arise, there will be open discussions about the impact of those issues and what that means for a main net launch. This does not mean there is a 'Delay', just a better picture of where things are.  
 

2. No individual working on Ethereum should be held accountable for a Mid-June release at this point. That is way too far in advance for anyone to possibly plan for based on the complexity of the codebase and ecosystem. What those individuals should be held accountable for is proper communication of the immediate and near-future work they are doing. If they discover or run into issues, they must, and undoubtedly will, raise all the necessary alarms. \[I am not claiming there has ever been an issue with this\]   


3. Please, for the love of whatever, do not spread that Mid-June is some magic hard-set date of when the Merge will go live. It is, at best, an estimate given how everything stands. People have been giving polls of when they 'think' the Merge will go live but no one has a crystal ball that can foresee every potential issue.

&#x200B;

Everyone is excited about this change, rightly so, and people want it out yesterday, but everyone should want a **Correctly Built Merge** to go live, not the one that happens to exist Mid-June.",92.0,2022-01-27 18:26:14,0.94

Ethereum 2.0 finality time?,"I'm trying to figure out the finality of Ethereum when it is fully upgraded in several years.  After the merge, splurge, verge, surge, all that jazz, when Ethereum's roadmap is fully complete, what will it's finality time be?

With a 6.4 minute epoc time, will we need to wait 2.5 epocs as I've seen before?  I'm wondering what Ethereum's final form will be and if we will still be waiting 15 minutes to consider a transaction final.

I'm extremely bullish on ETH, but if it's finality will never be under 15 minutes, there HAS to be other chains who will thrive with fast finality times.  In my opinion if this is the case, it confirms that the future is multi-chain.  Are there other solutions on Ethereum that I'm not aware of?

So I figured I'd post all the general statements that I and many other have been making over and over for a while now. I'm happy to elaborate on any of them, but please keep the discussion in good faith. I'm also willing to add more points if I forgot some. Some of these are my own opinion, some definitely require more context to understand properly (again, happy to elaborate) but the goal is to quickly summarize all the different stuff that gets brought up over and over.

Anyway yeah, if you're invested in Ethereum, or at the very least interested in it enough to be browsing this sub (why else would you be here lol) then you should be aware of the following:

1. Ethereum is the network, Ether is the currency. And there is no ""I"" anywhere in the name.

2. [Fees are high](https://cryptofees.info/) because that's how much the market values Ethereum's limited blockspace. It's purely supply and demand.
    * Fees scale with [how much computation is being executed](https://docs.ethhub.io/using-ethereum/transactions/), not how much money is being handled. It costs $5 on average to send any amount of Ether, whether it's $1's worth or $1 million's. It costs much more to do swaps and mint NFTs and such because those operations require more computation.
    * There is no way for anyone to artificially keep fees high unless they're willing to [literally burn millions of dollars per day for no reason](https://watchtheburn.com/).

3. Ethereum's blockspace is limited because letting people run nodes themselves on average consumer hardware is important for decentralization.
    * Decentralization is a spectrum and has many meanings from protocol specification, protocol implementation, node distribution, coin distribution, censorship resistance, permissionlessness, etc.
    * Pointing at one aspect to scream ""centralized"" isn't clever nor helpful. Chances are the aspect you point out is known and is an active area of research with a concrete plan on [the roadmap](https://i.imgur.com/vXMaIyZ.png) to address it and increase decentralization some more.
    * No blockchain is ever fully decentralized, especially not from the start – and Ethereum's end goal is to be able to run without a hiccup for *decades* if not *centuries*. At 6.5 years old, it's still very young.
    * If you care about decentralization, invest in and contribute to projects like Ethereum who view it as a goal, not a crutch that ""nobody cares about it that much anyway, let's just [increase the gas limit](https://github.com/binance-chain/bsc/issues/553) to have low fees asap""

4. There is a [vast difference](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/nodes-and-clients/#node-types) between an ""archive node"" (several TBs) and a ""full node"" (hundreds of GBs)
    * Running an archive node is not necessary to sync from genesis and verify blocks and transactions.
    * A full node has all the information enough to generate an archive node.
    * There are plans on [the roadmap](https://i.imgur.com/vXMaIyZ.png) to reduce the storage/bandwidth/RAM requirements of nodes even more, to a point where a smartphone will be able to independently verify and propagate new blocks. 

5. There is no ""when eth2 rolls out"" or ""when devs release eth2"" or god forbid ""when ethereum is upgraded to 2.0"". What there is instead is a roadmap consisting of a series of upgrades aiming to help rollups – *not the base layer* – scale to hundreds of thousands of TPS.
    * Depending on context, Eth1 is usually synonymous with ""execution layer"" and Eth2 usually means ""consensus layers"" ([helpful illustration](https://i.imgur.com/AHHcUgm.png)) otherwise ""eth2"" is an umbrella term for the set of upgrades over a long period of time, but the fact remains that there is no specific instant in time where ""eth1 turns into eth2"".
    * Similarly, there is no ""eth2"" coin. ETH is ETH, you don't have to do anything, the coins you hold today will be the same after the switch to proof of stake.

6. Unlocking staked Ether [will not cause a mass sell-off event](https://twitter.com/domothy/status/1467387422765953029). There is a limited withdrawing queue, it's not gonna happen all at once. And there are many more reasons for more people to start staking Ether than there are for the current stakers to exit en masse.
    * Also, unlocking staked Ether will not be possible directly after the merge. Withdrawals will be enable in the first fork that follows the merge ~6 months later.

7. There are plenty of options to avoid high gas fees, it's perfectly fine to use a sidechain to do your DeFi stuff for now. I use sidechains myself too. Just don't pretend these sidechains will replace Ethereum in any significant way as that's not even what they're trying to do.

8. Switching to Proof of Stake [will not lower Layer 1 gas fees significantly](https://willthemergelowergasprices.org/). Anyone saying otherwise is either misinformed or trying to mislead you into false expectations to bank on the inevitable mass disappointment following the merge.
    * It's still a monumental upgrade that will render possible much-needed upgrades like light clients, statelessness, and sharding, etc. that would otherwise be impossible or impractical to implement on the current proof of work chain.
    * It's basically a way to ""start from scratch"" while keeping the same coin, same users, same dapps, same network effects.
    * PoS has been on the roadmap [since day 1](https://blog.ethereum.org/2015/03/03/ethereum-launch-process/). Yes, estimates of PoS dates have been wrong before. However right now it's all hands on deck on the merge, the spec is done, the beacon chain is running, there is a [merge testnet running](https://blog.ethereum.org/2021/12/20/kintsugi-merge-testnet/), it's happening.

9. Sharding will not lower Layer 1 gas fees significantly either. Sharding is all about *data*, execution on Layer 1 will still be limited and expensive. What data sharding will do is help rollups (Layer 2) scale by several orders of magnitude.

10. [Rollups](https://mirror.xyz/ethmaxitard.eth/iyCAlOexgQKOvoSAAk4utYGEdnESOKb5HstM2_LaqL4) are [already live today](https://l2beat.com/) and they will only [get cheaper](https://l2fees.info/) as more people use them.

11. [Data sharding + rollups is the only sustainable way](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/pk57n7/why_rollups_data_shards_are_the_only_sustainable/) to scale a blockchain globally without compromising decentralization.
    * ""Sustainable"" as in the overall security model doesn't rely on hoping that the coin's price will pump forever to outpace the dilution from the blockchain issuing way more new coins than they collect in fees. Something that all major blockchains (including Ethereum most days, and even Bitcoin) are currently doing.
    * ""Without compromising decentralization"" as in more decentralization = more data for rollups = more scaling (lower individual fees on L2). Decentralization becomes an integral part of the scaling equation rather than a crutch.
    * [The rollup-centric roadmap](https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/a-rollup-centric-ethereum-roadmap/4698) is all about admitting that no single blockchain can do it all by itself and can't compete with what rollups can do. In other words, ""Ethereum maximalism"" amounts to helping independent teams develop rollups, innovate and compete with each other on top of Ethereum's secure, decentralized, and open platform.
    * The true competition of sidechains is rollups, not Ethereum itself. 
    * All the criticisms of a multi-rollup world apply to the current multi-chain world model as well. Except they apply way more to the multi-chain world and can be overcome way more easily in a multi-rollup world.
    * A rollup can settle on any L1, sure, but it's gonna gravitate towards the most secure, most decentralized and most credibly neutral settlement layer with the best data availability. Right now only Bitcoin and Ethereum fit those criteria (other L1s optimize for fast execution, not secure data availability) and Bitcoin would need a hard fork to implement rollup-friendly functions, so that only leaves Ethereum as the poised [""AWS for blockchain""](https://twitter.com/domothy/status/1465905887541972996).

12. Ether isn't meant to be a day-to-day currency that will replace fiat. The use-case of Ether isn't to pay for bread and milk, it's to pay for gas fees and secure the network. All the other use-cases derive from Ether's scarcity, but they're not strictly necessary.
    * Having Ether be an appreciating asset is good for the overall long-term health of the network by providing it with more [economic security, its holders more economic bandwidth](https://i.imgur.com/AErfdod.png), and its users more reasons to hold/stake. The incoming deflation is good.
    * However, the supply is not gonna be deflationary forever. The market dictates how much the blockspace is worth (so how much gets burned) and it also dictates how much the staking APR should be (so how much gets printed) so these two opposing forces will meet in the middle at some point. It's all about [them feedback loops](https://i.imgur.com/3bPV35a.png).

13. The security model trumps the economic model. The core idea behind the economic model is: ""[Minimum viable issuance to secure the network](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/izhkvk/minimum_viable_issuance_why_ethereums_lack_of_a/)"". It was designed from the start to be [disinflationary](https://blog.ethereum.org/2014/04/10/the-issuance-model-in-ethereum/) (as in, inflation % terms goes down over time) with even the idea of fee burning being mentioned in [early](https://blog.ethereum.org/2016/07/27/inflation-transaction-fees-cryptocurrency-monetary-policy/) publications and [FAQ](https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/Proof-of-Stake-FAQ/ba766606790d80422b23650d3326e2d963bdfa87)

14. It's okay to change or tweak things when new research indicates there's a problem with long-term sustainability or security of the current model. These changes don't happen ""on a whim of a few people"", there's a lot of consideration that go into them.
    * And remember, changes happen in a highly adversarial context. If there's *any* possibility of an upgrade causing security problems or being exploited in any way for profit, then it *will* happen. Changes don't just happen for fun ""just because"", they happen when their benefits outweigh the inherent risks of potentially adding more complexity.

15. The Ethereum Foundation is more of a [coordinator than a dictator](https://ethereum.foundation/philosophy/). It's much more of a community-focused bottom-up approach than the top-down structure people think.
    * Everything happens extremely transparently on open forums that no one reads and [public livestream calls](https://www.youtube.com/c/EthereumFoundation/videos) that no one listens to. But everyone who wants to participate is welcome, it's all out in the open.
    * The Ethereum Foundation doesn't code any of the actual software, client teams do. There are 5 major execution clients and 4 major consensus clients, developed by independent teams, to implement the protocol specification. This multi-client approach may be responsible for development delays, but it comes with [security benefits](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/mreacw/psa_the_importance_of_multiclient_and_why_the/)
    * [Anyone can propose an Ethereum Improvement Proposal](https://ethereum.org/en/eips/). You just have to convince others it's a good idea to implement it (most EIPs don't get implemented and fall into obscurity) and the clients could just refuse to code it in if it's a very bad idea. The more time passes, the harder it becomes to push changes to the Ethereum protocol and everything converges to the status quo. (This doesn't close the door to further innovation however, as it's still an open platform on which anyone can build)
    * Vitalik regularly gets his proposals blocked by client teams, other researchers, or the community in general. At most, he's a knowledgeable influence because he knows the tech and cryptography in depth and has been there from the beginning. It's silly to worship him, and it's silly to treat him as Ethereum's Zucc-like CEO. He's ""just some guy"".

16. The ""[DAO hard fork](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-779)"" wasn't a roll-back. Not a single transaction was reverted, no one lost any funds other than the exploiter who could have otherwise gotten away with [15% of the total supply at the time](https://www.coindesk.com/learn/2016/06/25/understanding-the-dao-attack/). It wasn't a bailout of Vitalik and his pals, it was a bailout of a huge chunk of the community from an event that could have killed the whole thing in its infancy. 
    * In the end it's all social consensus, and the consensus from miners, users, developers was strong. Even ""code is law"" is social consensus that [can get reverted in case of major bugs](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Value_overflow_incident). It's all about what the community deems [legitimate](https://vitalik.ca/general/2021/03/23/legitimacy.html).
    * *edit: see comments for more nuance on this point*

17. As far as the [initial distribution](https://i.imgur.com/k3GB8Lh.png) goes, Ethereum's ICO is among [the best of those who had an ICO](https://i.imgur.com/fmW3ytf.png), and as far as the current distribution goes (after 6 years of proof of work and market movements), it's [on par with Bitcoin's](https://medium.com/@adamscochran/the-10k-audit-42c100dd32bb). 60m of the 72m ""pre-mined"" coins went to a permissionless no-KYC sale, and [all the genesis transactions are included in Block #0](https://etherscan.io/txs?block=0) so you can check yourself that there's no hidden coins. Just like Bitcoin, early investors took on big risks and got big rewards. No surprises here. Any concerns of the ICO being a scam or rugpull should have vanished some time in 2015, yet here we are still talking about it for some reason.
    * And if coin distribution is a concern to you because proof of stake, then you should be glad the DAO hack didn't end up with a single person owning 15% of the supply...
    * *edit: see comments for more nuance on this point too lol*

18. There is no ""technical debt"" preventing Ethereum from scaling.

19. EIP-1559 was [not meant to lower gas fees](https://web.archive.org/web/20210205013340/https://willeip1559lowergasprices.org/) and no credible person ever promised it was a scaling solution.
    * It has [many benefits](https://domothy.com/eip1559/) beyond coin burning. The deflation is a nice side effect, and it's certainly not a gimmick meant to pump the price.

20. Proof of Work is really just Proof of Stake with extra steps.
    * In both systems, the goal is reach consensus in a sybil-resistant way. Spending time and energy by computing hashes over and over is just the easiest way to reach that goal. But if we can achieve that goal (randomness + verifiable delay functions) without using the energy of a continent, maybe we should look into it.
    * In both systems, whoever has capital gets to earn more capital by producing more blocks. (Except in Proof of Stake, everyone earns at the same rate, proportional to how much they stake)
    * In both systems, the capital that someone has at stake (mining rigs vs coins directly) is a good indicative that they will play by the rules.
    * By design, [Ethereum doesn't have on-chain governance](https://docs.ethhub.io/ethereum-basics/governance/#on-chain-governance). This means that the people with the most coins can't change the rules under PoS any more than the people with the most hash rate can change the rules under PoW.
    * Just like there are mining pools, there are staking pools. As usual, some options are [more decentralized and community-focused](https://rocketpool.net/) than others.",1066.0,2022-01-20 16:21:08,0.99

**Frequently Asked Questions**

**Where's the best place to buy ETH?**

There are many centralized exchanges that support Ethereum. If you live in the US, the most popular exchanges are Coinbase, Gemeni and Kraken. Coinbase users can use Coinbase Pro for lower fees.

**When is Eth2 launching?**

Eth2 is a marketing term used to represent a number of updates to Ethereum. The Eth2 proof-of-stake chain first launched in December 2020. ""The Merge"", which is the event that will fully switch Ethereum's consensus to proof-of-stake, is estimated to be ready in early 2022, although there is no exact timeline. Other updates, such as data shards, will follow that update.

Visit [ethmerge.com](https://ethmerge.com/) to learn more about ""The Merge"".

**Do I need to do anything to update to Eth2? Will Eth2 create a new token?**

No, ETH holders *never* need to take any action to keep holding ETH. Ethereum users will be unaffected by the Eth2 upgrade. And the Eth2 updates will not create any new tokens.

**How can I stake my ETH?**

There are two ways that you can stake your ETH: by running your own validator, or providing your ETH to a staking pool.

* Running your own validator requires a modern computer and 32 ETH. Visit /r/ethstaker for more details
* Staking pools accept any amount of ETH. We recommend [Lido](https://lido.fi/) or [StakeWise](https://stakewise.io/)

**Why are Ethereum transaction fees so high?**

Like most blockchains, Ethereum fees are determined by supply-and-demand. The large demand to use Ethereum has pushed transaction fees quite high (however, fees were just a few cents only 2 years ago). Fees are especially high during market volatility, and during NFT drops.

**What is being done to lower Ethereum transaction fees?**

Ethereum fees are reduced by using layer-2 rollups. Rollups are scaling solutions that allow for significantly cheaper transactions, while still maintaining Ethereum's security.

Additionally, Eth2's data shards will make rollups even cheaper.

While rollups are cutting-edge technology being actively developed, a number are already live on Ethereum mainnet. Visit [l2beat.com](https://l2beat.com/) to learn more about rollups.

**What's the best wallet for Ethereum?**

The most popular tool for using decentralized applications is Metamask. However, for security reasons, we recommend using a hardware wallet such as a Trezor or Ledger.

The Merge - June 2022,"I was browsing Ethereum's source code in [github](https://github.com/ethereum) and came across the term [TERMINAL\_TOTAL\_DIFFICULTY](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/6816df86d006c1db4df91f88c574c27aa4d937c5/EIPS/eip-3675.md#definitions).

The proof of stake merge will not do a single thing for transaction cost reduction.,"I’ve seen a lot of comments floating around lately to “ wait for the PoS merge to see reduced fees”. Let me explain why this won’t do anything for fees. 

We are just changing the “ consensus” or how transactions are verified. We are going from physical miners to validators. This will not change any aspects of the blocks such as block size, throughput, etc. therefore fees will be the exact same. 

What this will have are other benefits such as environmental conservation, less selling pressure due to an incentive to hold ETH, a disincentive to be malicious to to slashing, etc. 

The only two items I see that will reduce gas fees are L2s and sharding (will come out sometime after the merge).",679.0,2022-01-02 13:14:49,0.87
"(Doge/Ethereum two-way peg, x-post from /r/dogecoin) I wrote up an implementation of scrypt in EVM for use in verifying dogecoin block headers","Here it is:

https://github.com/ethereum/dapp-bin/tree/master/scrypt

Note that it currently takes ~370M gas to verify one instance of scrypt, hence the function in my script above has the ability to save partial progress and start from the most recent saved state and go as far as it can; you need to send 118 transactions before the function actually returns an answer. The bulk of the annoyance is scrypt's choice to use salsa20, which needed to be implemented in serpent; if it weren't for that then the whole thing would likely be doable in one or two transactions.

Since this is obviously absurdly inefficient, you do need some cryptoeconomic machinery to make sure that the verification happens extremely rarely. My preferred scheme is a system where to submit a scrypt solution you must provide a security deposit with some minimum (say, 25 eth), and then there is a period of six hours where anyone can either challenge you (by submitting the 118 transactions to compute the scrypt result inside the blockchain) or outbid you (say, by at least 2x). If someone outbids you, then you or anyone else have six hours to outbid or challenge them. Once a challenge period runs out, or if the 118 transactions are submitted, the winner is determined based on either, if possible, the actual result of the 118 transactions or by who submitted the highest bid, and the winners and the transaction submitter proportionately collect 50% of the security deposits of the losers (the other 50% is burned). The theory is that the _threat_ of someone submitting the 118 transactions disincentivizes people from submitting a bad scrypt solution in the first place, and if the initial deposit is too low then the escalation mechanism allows other players to force it higher. Hence, in the normal case, people will just submit correct scrypt solutions with the minimal deposit and everyone will be happy.

The next step is actually integrating this into a version of btcrelay. I am not an expert on how litecoin/dogecoin merge mining works, so I'll need some help here on taking this code and turning it into an actual dogecoin block header verifier. For reference the original btcrelay can be found here: https://github.com/ethereum/btcrelay/

Is Rootstock a threat to Ethereum?,"Just some thoughts, let me know what you think.

**Does Rootstock currently pose a threat to Ethereum?**

This depends. If smart contracts start to play a bigger and bigger role in powering decentralised applications, we might find that it will be unacceptable to host a smart contract on Rootstock.

This is because Rootstock is currently a federated sidechain (read: centralised) and relies on merge mining, a poor choice for security.

If smart contracts never move past the toy phase and are only being used to handle small amounts of money, etc.. it's likely Rootstock will be competitive to Ethereum.

As I believe that smart contracts, autonomous code, etc... will become a defining feature of the next technological movement, Ethereum will be far more attractive for deployment than Rootstock.

**Is there any real threat then?**

Yes! If someone figures out a way to:

1. Have a sidechain on Bitcoin that doesn't have the merge mining requirement.
2. And is still secure, with no chance of funds being stolen, (read: doesn't require mining.)
3. And is decentralised.

Ethereum may have a real problem.

**Conclusion**

At the moment the nature of the setup for Rootstock poses Ethereum no real threat.

However, a breakthrough with sidechains most certainly could cause a problem.

**Solution**

Ethereum should starting aiming to become Bitcoin faster than Bitcoin becomes Ethereum.

I know many of you have heard that line before, what does it mean and how do we get there?

Complete these projects:

1. Sharding.
2. Raiden.
3. PoS

But most importantly, to really unleash the above 3, we need to:

*Accept that ETH is also able to be used a digital currency that can directly compete with Bitcoin.*

I understand that is very controversial, however I believe that it's acceptance is important for Ethereum.",24.0,2016-11-13 03:37:55,0.8

> **Event update**

The buzz during the day was around the ""stick puzzle"" that Bok Khoo was giving out to people. It is just a stick, with a loop of string. He gets you to turn away, he uses ""the trick"" to put it onto your bag and then you try to get it off.

The WeChat channel was just filled with everyone asking where they can get it, and the screaming that they can't figure it out. Only about 5 people reported they were able to solve it (I haven't yet)

> **Sessions**

I'm biased, but I thought the announcement from Microsoft with the update of cryptlets was a big deal. The morning sessions covered a few different oracle systems, the afternoon had lots of IPFS sessions.

**Microsoft - A Lap around Cryptlets**

https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/cryptletsdd/
https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/templates/ethereum-consortium-blockchain-network/
https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/author/marleyg

Microsoft was a sponsor of Devcon1 & 2
Ethereum is a 1st class citizen
Support for community & partners - Bizspark, Meetups, Workshops

Announcing:
Bletchley v1
Distributed Ledger stack
V1 is a private Ethrerum consortium, that you can spin up for your own enterprise / group

http://imgur.com/olwwd36

Cryptlets are being developed to help with security, identity, etc.
How do you get trusted external data feeds injected into the Blockchain?
Doing things on a specific interval (every 15 mins)
When price of something hits a threshold (oil goes above $40/barrel)
Secure IP protected algorithms, but still share with blockchain network.
Use libraries for common platforms (.Net, Java, etc)

Cryptlets vs Oracle
Cryptlets will have a marketplace on Azure that will allow you to purchase and utilise

Use case: Trigger on an event
Wake up on 4pm, if market was open that day, then give me the price of gold for that day.Get signature of attested server, attested sender.

Use case: Control
Using smart contract like a traditional DB. Declare data you are keeping track of, and the functions/""stored proc"" to update that data.
Cryptlet runs off chain, and can be scaled up.

http://imgur.com/ysgL8S2

Utility cryptlet. Use an attribute in solidity contract with cryptlet details
Developer references at design time the cryptlet they want the contract to call
Contract cryptlet, deploy the cryptlet at same time as contract.

Why would you want Azure to do this?
SGX allows you to create ""secure enclaves"", can have complete isolation on the hardware chip where it is not modifable.
Provides a secure enclave at the CPU level. Can give full attestation right down to the silicon.
Will be provided as a enclave container on Azure.
Will be released for .NET core CLR first, then other languages.
Can create cryptlet libraries that you can scale and put into the Azure marketplace.
An ecosystem for developers & ISVs to consume and publish.

Bletchley v1 released today will let you spin up a private consortium.
Before today, it took a long time to try and deploy a private consortium (can take weeks to read doco,
Now takes 5 minutes to deploy!
Creates a private consortium, puts each member in its own separate subnet

Mist Vision and Demo
I was too busy sharing the release posts of Microsoft project bletchey v1, missed this talk.
It did look interesting, I will watch this one later.
Idea: Reward for bandwidth. Providing connection could replace mining as entrance point for desktop computers. Allow you to have a trickle so you can trigger smart contracts.
Standardised backends, so that you can swap out the underlying node between geth, blockapps, etc.

**Web3.js**

https://github.com/ethereum/web3.js
Etehereum JS API
Smart conracts are EVM opcodes,
Helps translates calls to JSON RPC calls. Helps do the ABI encoding when sending data from JS to EVM
It kept on growing, many different utility functions being thrown in. Is time to clean it up and be refactored.

They are now building a NEW web3.js
The communication will be socket based, will enable subscriptions. Everything will be based on promises to subscribe to events, like log events.
Bunch of other newer cleaner methods and ways to do things like deploying contracts.

**Smart contract security**

Was a very good postmorteum of The DAO and things that could be done to mitigate it in the future.

An issue with The DAO was trying to do a massive jump from centralisation all the way to full decentralisation. Meant no one could step up and make a decision on how to save it. We need to make smaller steps towards full decentralisation as we learn as a community how to do this.
Same security patterns as yesterday's talks: check invarients, beware 1024 call stack depth, reentry exploit (update state BEFORE executing calls), timestamps are manipulatable.
Updateable contracts. Who can update it? Community multisig?
We need better rools: formal verification, compiler warnings, improved IDEs, trusted libraries, excape hatches

Conclusion: It is still very early days in this space, be careful.

**A Provably Honest Oracle Model: Auditable Offchain Data Gathering & Computations**

Oracalize is the most widely used oracle (until everyone starts using Microsoft Azure cryptlets ;-) )
Contract calls Oracalize contract with the data they want, off chain they see this get the data, Oracalise then trigger their contract externally, which does a callback to your contract with the data.
Can use external notary servers.
Can get proof from multiple external services to get a higher level of confidence about data (e.g. stock price from a few feeds).
Off-chain (auditable_ computation)
AWS sandbox 2.0.
Put the execution package onto IPFS, AWS gets it and executes it, signs it.

**iEx.ec: Fully Distributed Cloud Thanks to the Ethereum Blockchain**

http://iex.ec/  
Provides blockchain based execution environments
Global market for computing resources.
Idea is to do what we did before with ""grid computing"" use the idle capacity of computers. But this time do a trickle of micropayments. Allows people to harness this global power to execute their tasks in a global ""distributed cloud"".

**The Final frontier: The company smart conract**

http://otonomos.com/
Helping companies to incorporate on the blockchain.

**Smart oracles**

https://github.com/smartoracles
Connecting to external resources is difficult. Hard to try and use external currencies (like a bank account / fiat money) to make transactions. Could hook in paypal, HSBC, wells fargo, etc.
Can provide your own payment services as an API to a smart oracle for smart contracts to consume.
Do off chain data storage by calling smart oracle API
Roadmap: more data sources & more payment methods

**IPFS & Ethereum: Updates**

https://Ipfs.io  
IPFS is AMAZING, seriously go watch the full 1 hour talks Juan has given in previous years.

Current web has current issues. Centralisation, etc.
IPFS is a new hypermedia transfer protocol
Content can be retrieved not from specific servers, but instead via it's hash so that it can come from anywhere in the network (maybe from the person next to you who has cached it).
It is highly modular, all of the transfer protocals, routing, naming, etc. are all swapable
Is available as GO-IPFS & now JS-IPFS
Means now you can run IPFS in the browser
IPFS was great for static content, but not so great for dynamic content. Low latency pub/sub protocol will help with dynamic data.
Created a distributed peer to peer chat app using this new dynamic content protocol.
IPLD a common link-tree hash format
Will be able to use IPFS to retrieve ethereum blockchain blocks DIRECTLY
Can use IPFS as a package manager to retrieve them in a distributed manner.

Many projects are using Ethereum & IPFS Uport, Digix, Infura, Ujo, Eris, Blockfreight.
Filecoin was created as a way to try and incentivize nodes to keep files longer time.
People rent out hdd space to earn filecoin. Exchange bitcoin/filecoin. Use filecoin to store files in network.
Filecoin is going to be built on top of the public Ethereum blockchain, as a virtual blockchain / token.

**IPFS Libp2p & Ethereum networking**

Network connectivity between any 2 nodes can be difficult. Censorship, bandwidth, network issues, etc.
Having to deal with different networking topologies and access.
Libp2p & Devp2p is different. Devp2p is for Ethereum. LIbp2p is modular, can swap out components to change network access, encryption methods, etc.
Can build up a MEGA mesh network, by utilising traditional wired internet, radio, bluetooth between some nodes.
Web browser using web socket, to a node, which routes across network, to zigbee to a IoT device.
Libp2p & Devp2p could merge and augment each other. Could create the libp2p components to replace the devp2p bits
Any 2 nodes that speak the same protocol can communicate and be a part of the network chain.
Experiment. They took the browser based version of EVM. Then used Libp2p to talk to the Ethereum network. Had a complete ethereum node running in a browser.

**Uport**

https://uport.me/
Universal identity platform
Current challenges: key management. Ux for average person. Dapps via mobile. Identity and data ownership.
How do you keep a consistent identity, even if you lose a key.
Have some multisig contracts that you can use to keep track.
Social recovery, use your friends to attest it is really you.
Keep private key on mobile, do transactions on the desktop, scan a QR code to sign the transaction on your phone and send it off.

**A Deep Dive into the Colony Foundation Protocol**

It is an open source governance protocol built on Ethereum
Problem with voting is how to prevent Sybil attacks.
Votes are weighted by a reputation score.
Reputation is non-transferable that can only be earned.
Total weighted voting helps mitigate this.

**Chain orchestration tooling & smart contract package management**

Eris is tooling for developers.
Package manager to build your own blockchain.
Can compose a chain, e.g. geth + tendermint consensus.
Init, install, do.
Can easily install on Mac/bew, linux/apt-get, Windows/choco

**The Golem Project: Ethereum-based market for computing power**

http://www.golemproject.net/
Anyone can make an offer to sell computing power. e.g. Distributed rendering
Want to create a standard framework that anyone can use to submit and process jobs.

**Status: Integrating Ethereum Into Our Daily Lives**

https://status.im
Want to get ethereum everywhere. ""Mist for Mobile""
Everyone is using their mobile phones for everything, but mostly using instant messaging.
What would Ethereum in a IM window look?
Created a IM mobile app that has a local geth node. tart up, it asks you to create a password, it generates a pub/private pair.
Then can send messages via whisper, and the messages are signed with your public key.
Can load Dapps up in the local webview and interact with them.
Allows you to create ""chat Dapps"", that you interact with via text. Like chatbots

**Maker Ecosystem Overview**

www.Makerdao.com
Dai: seeking stability on blockchain.
Stablecoin engine: smart contract that holds collateral reserves and controls the Dai lifecycle.
MKR: open source community managing risk of the system
In the last year, investing in a solid technical core. More slow and audit things. Moving into the next phase of stablecoin development.
Their latest project is the ""Simplecoin project""
Meeting Thereum community's need for stability. An independent platform for creating centrally administered simple stablecoins.
Issues create their own rule sets: Collateral types, participant whitelists, security parameters.
Example: Shrutebucks. The only people who own it are Dwight, Jim & Pam. They backed it with 1/3 ETH 1/3 DGX 1/3 DUSD.

**Orbit. A distributed peer to peer app on IPFS**

https://github.com/haadcode
Created a full distributed chat room, itself distributed through IPFS.
It is integrated with uPort for identification
Using uPort allows you to verify that you are talking to the correct person in the chat channel. All their messages are signed with their public keys
He also created a full distribited twitter clone, using uport for the identity as well.
Orbit-db key value store DB that stores its data on IPFS. Eventually consistent
Appends data to the DB, an event is sent to those subscribed on pub/sub so they can see the latest root hash. Based on CRDT
Ethereum + Pubsub + CRDTs + IPFS = super power primatives to build dynamic distributed apps

Development considerations with distributed apps.
Need to ensure that apps work offline.
No centralised servers.
No data silos.
Provide integration path.

Future work: could you use uPort for ACL like permissions?
Mobile use cases, how to make it work nicely on mobiles

**Building scalable React Dapp architecture**

https://github.com/SilentCicero/react-dapp-boilerplate
React + Ethereum
He has a configured boilerplate template.
Has contract scaffolding. Enforced contract Linting/testing. Wallet generation/identity. Preconfigured web3 instance.
UI: Mature react arhitecture ""react boilerplate"". Prices listed in USD with ETH/btc via kraken api. A basic multi-contract example Dapp. Offline first, dapp runs without internet.
Uses Redux. State models in UI & blockchains work well.
PostCSS, CSS Modules, sanitize.cs. Redux, immutableJS, reslect, redux-saga, i18n, redux-router.
Web3, ethdeploy, dapple, solium, eth-lightwallet, chaithereum, ethereumjs0-testrpc
Enforced contract testing in 2 languages.

**Ethereum for Enterprise (BlockApps Strato)**

Trying to make sure that Ethereum stays relevent to enterprise development.
Why do you need a blockchain WITHIN an org, shouldn't they trust each other? Well different departments may not, they may reconcile differently, and can help automate/orchestrate between them.
Blockchain is the ""killer app"" for cloud financial services. Legacy infrastructure, batch prossing, etc are all restricting fintech from progressing. Blockchain can happen in real time, can replace legacy.
Ethereum is very flexible and programmable, works well. There are others based on Bitcoin (like Hyperledger).
Ethereum + Blockapps = Extreme productivity + Proven Technology.
Blockapps is extending Ethereum for Enterprise.
Runs very well on Azure
Enterprises don't want all their data exposed on public chain. Blockapps helps solve data privacy and scaling with multichain fabrics.",69.0,2016-09-21 17:16:38,0.96
Very welcome Wallet.sol Improvements by Benedict Chan. Please all have a look.,"We would like to merge these wallet.sol PR's, as they make interacting with the wallet contract easier, than the original one written by Gavin Wood.

To make sure its solid, please take your time and look at them to find any bugs, or security issues http://github.com/ethereum/dapp-bin/pulls/bencxr",42.0,2016-08-01 13:16:36,0.94
Two Chains,"It seems like this fork is going through.  So I've turned to looking at the implications.  

At block FORK-1 there will be one ethereum.  At block FORK, there will suddenly be two ethereum's.  Like parallel universes.  And they will almost immediately drift apart.  

Unlike a protocol fork, where for example we are changing a hash algorithm, the fork changes the *state* being transported by the network.  Before the fork there is one state (in which there is a DAO, and an attacker).  After the fork there are two states, with identical participants, except on one, most of theDAO has been obliterated, and a new recovery mode exists; and on the other there's an attacker who probably isn't done yet. 

These two states create different externalities as of block FORK.   For clients who do not update, DAO tokens have lower certainty of getting eth in return.  This means that they will have a higher value.

However, eth will have higher liquidity on the forked side because certainly some of those DAO tokens that get converted to eth will then be liquidated.  

And on one side there is a hacker, wanting to run cat-and-mouse transactions, that the Robin Hood group will need to counter with counter-transactions…  and on the other side, there will be a rush to liquidate DAO tokens that have no other use than as a proxy for 0.01 eth.  As long as there isn't a bug hidden somewhere in the recovery code… 

So this means we should expect on the forked side, DT have higher value, eth have lower value (relative to the unforked side) when compared to an external currency.

Naturally, people who hold either DT or eth will have different motivations to buy and sell in these different views of the future.  Which is just about everyone who will be doing a trade or transaction.

There is no way to just throw all of this in the air and say ""we'll let the market decide"", unless there are two active networks, and in fact two active networks is what I would expect to transpire.

We can work it backwards from the ""end state"" and see why this is likely to happen.  

Firstly, exchanges.  Exchanges have demonstrated that they will  trade extremely small fractions of ethereum, or even marginal less-popular currencies.  So even if one side of the network ends up being worth a small fraction of the billion dollars or so that the total represents, sooner or later there will be one rogue exchange that will liquidate eth on the unpopular side. 

Second, miners.  If there's even a small group of miners (heck even one), blocks can be mined on the unpopular side.  That's just how it works. They'll also get all the gas.  It might not be worth much, but there may be an opportunity to make more (numerically) mining for all of the transactions on a barely-used network than by mining a fraction of a highly used network.  And if there's that rogue exchange, miners can liquidate their gas. I don't know what the break-even point is, but when ethereum started, it didn't have a lot of mining capacity relative to what could be deployed today.

wallets:  if I own 10,000 eth trapped on a dead chain, I'd happily trade it for 1 eth, or even 0.1 eth on a live chain, because even 0.1 eth is better than zero eth.   So even on a chain that the world practically abandons, if there is one exchange and one miner that supports it, there will be transactions as people who have ethereum trapped in the dead will trickle through the exits.

Furthermore, since the fork is surgical, and ethereum is open source, a highschool student could merge upates and keep the two chains synchronized.  So the unpopular fork can be maintained pretty much forever.

Oh… and for those who are sure the Forked DAO Rescue side of the chain will quickly win, don't count on it.  Because on the other chain, there is an attacker, who will want to split out.  If the Robin Hood gang aren't there transacting, then they won't be able to defeat the hacker, so he'll win - the whole 15%.  Attacker has a lot of incentive to keep the unsplit DAO going.  And if he's there, so is the White-Hat group, or he wins.

Therefore there will be transactions, mining, and exchanges.  On both chains.  The question that remains, what is the value of tokens on the unpopular network?

If Ethereum is worth a billion dollars with the DAO, it's certainly worth 850 millions without it.  So if Ethereum abandons the unspoilt side of the chain, our attacker can create a perfectly competitive, and perfectly compatible alter-ethereum.  Entirely for free.  Furthermore, if the attacker dominates the mining pool, he could selectively ""forget"" or ""omit"" white-hat transactions.  So the community can't let this happen. 

The best outcome for the hacker is to let the ethereum community fork.  Declare the network dead and abandon activity.  Then light up a few miners, bribe an exchange with a million or so, and presto… they are operating an entirely equivalent, perfectly functional ethereum network.   Since there's at least 15% community support to follow this thread, other exchanges will come (why not, it's pretty much a select-statement away from being supported - way easier than some of the many other alt-coins out there, and all those transaction fees…). 

So all of that means that if we fork, the end game is two live streams of ethereum.  The only difference is who controls the 15% that went into the DAO, and the price of eth on either side.  From a functionality perspective, equivalent.

Since the attacker (at least) has strong economic incentive to keep the unforked side alive, miners have economic incentive to participate, exchanges have economic incentive to participate and ethereum wallets have economic incentive to participate, I see two active chains. 

I really don't think this whole fork was thought through from a ""what happens afterwards"" perspective.  If someone wants to poke a hole in this logic, please go ahead, but what I see is market forces will lead to two ethereums. And I'm really thinking this is a bad thing.

MyEtherWallet.com v2.0 (aka Mewtwo) has arrived!,"[WhooooHooo!](http://i.imgur.com/GDKaIaN.png)

---

In August of 2015, /u/kvhnuke and I threw together a couple of pages so that I could play with my ETH from the pre-sale without using command line. Then we shared it with you all. That's all it was at the time. A simple tool with a simple goal that we figured would be modestly used and... who knows.

This is what [the very very first version](http://i.imgur.com/RSnvWql.jpg) and [the first version](http://i.imgur.com/KxZ1qow.jpg) looked like. [Here's where we were yesterday.](http://i.imgur.com/dw80AYc.jpg) And....here we are now.

We've expanded from generating wallets, to sending transactions, to sending offline transactions, to allowing users to participate in the Augur and Digix crowdsales. We launched a freaking Chrome Extension. We've updated the UI and help pages incessantly in order to make Ethereum as easy as possible for newcomers. We've cut our weekly ""I was supposed to save my whattt?"" emails from ~5/week to <1/month.

Since we never knew we were going to get this far, the codebase has slowly become more and more unwieldy. So, for the past month /u/kvhnuke and I have been doing something a bit less exciting: a big fat cleanup job in order to get our ducks in a row and ensure that maintaining and growing MyEtherWallet in the future is easier, faster, and cleaner. 

You won't see 90% of what we have been doing because it's all about getting the code cleaner, more modular, and just better. Here's the other 10% that you will: 

---

**New Features**

- New main font, more monospace fonts when appropriate (address, etc.)

- Ability to include custom gas / data in the standard send transaction tab.

- QR codes on the Offline Transaction tab for easier transferring between computers. 

- New encryption method. Now matches geth / Mist keystore format (v3) to make moving between MyEtherWallet and Mist *much* easier. Just copy and paste the file into your keystore directory and you're set!

- Ability to create a custom link that will pre-fill the send transaction tab with the to address, amount, data, and gas. All the user has to do is unlock their wallet and press send. 

You can edit the URL query strings to be to whatever address with whatever you want, with whatever amount you want etc. All this does is prefill the fields for a user. The default gas limit is 21000 for a standard transaction. All data must be in HEX format. All address should start with 0x.

---

**Next Steps**

- Merge existing Digix page into the new codebase & add the ability to claim Digix tokens. (This will happen before April 28th.)

- Merge new codebase into the Chrome Extension. 

- Prep for Slock.it

- Make it easier for users to make those custom URLS and maybe make some fancy buttons for people to put on their website.

- kvhunuke only: Graduate & frame that big fat Computer Engineering diploma.

- Do whatever you tell us to. ;)

As always, we welcome all feedback. We would also like to take the time to let you know how much we appreciate all your support and generosity and feedback and praise and comments and late-night emails over the past 8 months. We wouldn't be here without you, we couldn't do this without you, and you have no idea how we love this unexpected adventure. Thank you.

---

And, a final note: This has been thoroughly tested but....MyEtherWallet, Ethereum, and some of the underlying Javascript libraries we use are under active development. While we have tested thoroughly, there is always the remote possibility that something unexpected happens that causes your ETH to be lost. While do everything we can to ensure that this does not happen and are available via email/reddit/twitter to assist in every way we can, this possibility still exists. Please do not invest more than you are able to lose and please be careful. If something were to happen, we are sorry, but we are not responsible for the lost Ether.",79.0,2016-04-18 07:08:50,0.98
Ethereum in the year of the fire monkey! can you keep up?,"Soon after we celebrate the [two-year anniversary of the official release of the white paper](https://blog.ethereum.org/2016/02/09/cut-and-try-building-a-dream/) with the [one millionth block on the frontier](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/45n7n9/ethereum_has_reached_1_million_blocks/), amazing news keep coming in so rapidly that even the world's fastest client cannot finish syncing before the next incredible story hits.

# Notes
Video starts at [4:03](https://youtu.be/1GulA7iA-O0?t=243)

## [[6:05](https://youtu.be/1GulA7iA-O0?t=365)] 1. Testing Updates

### a. Fuzzer updates
Go and Rust clients can work with it and Guido is working on integrating cpp-ethereum. Guido is also working on a bignum fuzzer to make sure bignum libraries are aligned across the clients. Smart contract fuzzing has been discussed, as has fuzzing the network stack, but it has not started yet.

### [[8:56](https://youtu.be/1GulA7iA-O0?t=536)]  b. [New transaction tests folder structure.](https://github.com/ethereum/tests/tree/gentransact/TransactionTests)
There have been changes to the transaction tests to help organize it better and be more representative of the different categories. More technical detail in the call.

## [[11:00](https://youtu.be/1GulA7iA-O0?t=660)] 2. [Shall we require CC0 notices in EIPs?](https://github.com/ethereum/pm/issues/27#issuecomment-348181284)
We agreed that the requirement for CC0 notice should be made going forward. Yoichi made a pull request on EIP 1 to change that. Existing EIPs that do not have the copyright will need to change and we can create PRs for them that they just have to give written permission to change.

## [[35:10](https://youtu.be/1GulA7iA-O0?t=2110)] 3. New Project: JSON RPC Proxy / eth-agent
  a. Discussion: https://github.com/ethereum/cpp-ethereum/issues/4563
  b. Proof of Concept: https://github.com/chfast/json-rpc-proxy/releases/tag/v0.1.0a1
cpp-ethereum components are being separated into separate projects. Components that are not required to run an Ethereum node may be split from the core cpp-ethereum code. The first component to be split off are the HTTP server that is in the client. The JSON RPC proxy can sign transactions for you which acts like an account management component in a way. An update to EthStats which moves it to the shared tooling projects may also be in the works soon.

Separating the account management from the client will help lessen the security overhead of the Ethereum node operators. geth is planning on slowly moving away from account management and Martin is working on an account management tool with a public API that doesn't take passwords. It instead requires interaction with a custom UI and sending remote transactions to the tool.

## [[14:56](https://youtu.be/1GulA7iA-O0?t=896)] 4. [Does it remain the case that the Yellow Paper is intended to be Ethereum's formal specification?](https://github.com/ethereum/pm/issues/27#issuecomment-347997598)
Ben brought up some questions (linked in the title) about the future of the Yellow Paper and it's place as the official specification for clients.

Ben's questions:
> Question: does it remain the case that the YP is intended to be Ethereum's formal specification?
> 
> If yes, then it should be noted that the YP is currently significantly out of date.
> 
> a. What is the plan for bringing the YP up to date post-Byzantium?
> 
> b. What is the process and ownership for maintaining the YP going forward?
> 
> c. Should updating the YP be made part of the EIP finalization process?
> 
> d. To facilitate c., Should EIPs be required to include a pull request to the Yellow Paper (if relevant) before they are accepted?
> 
> e. When consensus failures are discovered (e.g. during the recent fuzz testing), how can we make sure that the YP is updated where necessary?
> 
> If no,
> 
> a. What replaces the YP as the authoritative specification of Ethereum?
> 
> b. Is the YP worth maintaining as a resource that is descriptive rather than prescriptive? If so, the questions above still stand.

Having changes to the Yellow Paper or other formal spec. be merged before certain EIPs are accepted is a good idea.

Gavin Wood maintains the [Yellow Paper](https://github.com/ethereum/yellowpaper) and there are a list of contributors to the Yellow Paper on GitHub. The Yellow Paper doesn't have a copyright which opens up some confusing legal issues for those wanting to fork the Yellow Paper or make unofficial changes that are not merged by Gav. Biggest concern is it is unclear who can legally merge pull requests without legal concerns being attached. There are currently pull requests for the Yellow Paper to bring it up to date.
The Yellow Paper isn't a complete specification of everything needed to build a client and some expressed opinions that the Yellow Paper is difficult to read. [KEVM](https://github.com/kframework/evm-semantics) is a formal specification written in K that can be execute test cases that may be a candidate to replace the Yellow Paper. KEVM is licensed under UIUC/NCSA License. Afri is going to reach out to Gavin to ask about updating and licensing the Yellow Paper include him in this conversation.

Piper suggested having a developer grant for a group that keeps the Yellow Paper or other formal spec. up to date. Currently Dev Grants (Ethereum Foundation grants program) is not active, but may be active in the future.

## [[43:24](https://youtu.be/1GulA7iA-O0?t=2604)] 5. POA Testnet unification [Update]
No updates.

## [[43:51](https://youtu.be/1GulA7iA-O0?t=2631)] 6. Core team updates.
- Parity - Working on release 1.5. No major new features. Mostly working on stabilizing stuff. Improvements on database layer are also happening, specifically replacing the database layer with a new type of database. They are working on Parity multi-sig issue and preparing a list of different approaches on how we can address the problem. They will present a list of proposals at the next core dev meeting. ""We will discuss them with the community and see where it goes from there.""
- geth - New release with no major changes. Working on improving the block tracing.
- cpp-ethereum - Still is post-Mexico mode from Devcon3. Mostly cleaning up some stuff from the Byzantium hard fork. Yoichi has been going through and updating EIPs. Discussion is ongoing with Pawel and Andrei about a roadmap for features. Dimitry has been updating the testing framework. Shout out to Martin H.S, cdetrio, Guido, and other who are contributing to the fuzzer framework
- Harmony - Migrated client to RocksDB. Work is basically complete on making Harmony compatible.
- ethereum-js - No updates.
- pyEVM - Big GitHub migration from Piper's GitHub to Ethereum Foundation's GitHub. Repos have been re-named to make it more clear what each one does. Pretty far along with implementing the light client protocol. Early alpha release of the client (currently called Trinity) expected in the next month. Integration with Hive and JSON-RPC specs are still left to do. The research team is working on moving their Casper implementation to pyEVM.
- pyethapp - There is Casper research testnet utilizing pyethereum.
- EWASM - Roadmap has been created. Aim to launch a preliminary testnet by the end of January.
- Solidity - Release made the day before that had some improvements including fully implemented ABI encoding/decoding (will require specifying experimental release in the header). Really focusing on the SMT solver in Solidity for the next release.

Martin H.S mentioned that there is someone working on a C# Ethereum client that is passing almost all state tests and VM tests. Estimates are that it will be complete in a couple of months. At this point it is still in a private repository, but if people want to help out reach out to Martin and he will connect you.

# Notes
Video starts at [[00:03](https://youtu.be/naPA7tjrgsk?t=3)].

## [[00:33](https://youtu.be/naPA7tjrgsk?t=33)] & [[22:37](https://youtu.be/naPA7tjrgsk?t=1357)] 1. Testing Updates
Yoichi is doing some clean-up of Byzantium test cases. Dimitry is currently working on changing the test source format into YAML. Final tests will still be JSON, this only affects the test source. Those who write tests can use YAML and use multi-line contract source code and write comments.

## [[1:12](https://youtu.be/naPA7tjrgsk?t=72)] 2. Digital cats caused network congestion this month. Meow.

### [[1:22](https://youtu.be/naPA7tjrgsk?t=82)] a. Why did this happen and what solutions are available to prevent future network congestion? See comments below for some ideas.
The gas limit was 6.7 million and crypto kitties used 1-2 million gas per block worth of demand. Usage pushed the transaction fees higher due to demand. Miners upped the gas limit a bit, but usage has grown even more and we are now at an 8 million gas limit and blocks are basically full.

### [[2:20](https://youtu.be/naPA7tjrgsk?t=140)] b. [Stateless Clients proposal](https://github.com/ethereum/pm/issues/28#issuecomment-349676284).
[Alexey Akhunov](https://github.com/AlexeyAkhunov) [described a stateless protocol design](https://medium.com/@akhounov/how-to-speed-up-ethereum-in-the-face-of-crypto-kitties-7a9c901d98e9). Vitalik has [been pushing the stateless protocol paradigm](https://medium.com/@VitalikButerin/regarding-bandwidth-requirements-for-stateless-clients-i-can-give-some-precise-numbers-be357fb69b6d) a lot because it is the direction they are looking at for sharding research. Stateless clients means that instead of the client storing the entire state the client would just store the state root and it would be the responsibility of the miners or transaction senders to package up with the block or the transaction the witness blocks. Witness blocks contain merkle branches that prove that all of the parts of the state required for processing all transactions in that block, and computing the next state root. Although this is theoretically viable, it would require a lot of substantial changes to gas costs and other factors [described here](https://medium.com/@VitalikButerin/regarding-bandwidth-requirements-for-stateless-clients-i-can-give-some-precise-numbers-be357fb69b6d). Other optimizations include the making it so we can access Patricia tree nodes in parallel and bumping cache sizes.
Low effort scaling solutions could potentially be included in Constantinople.

A complete discussion on these issues is [included here](https://github.com/ethereum/pm/issues/28).

### c. [Would having minimum system requirements to set up an optimal client/full node help?](https://github.com/ethereum/pm/issues/28#issuecomment-351141485).
Discussed tangentially in subsection b.

### [[24:12](https://youtu.be/naPA7tjrgsk?t=1452)] d. [Is the bottleneck is not just disk bandwidth, but specifically sequential disk bandwidth? ](https://github.com/ethereum/pm/issues/28#issuecomment-351350231).
Vitalik asks: Are random SSD reads parallizable? Would it take less time to perform 20 random reads than doing a single read? This may help with optimization to do multiple tree reads in parallel. Although it is not fully clear, it appears to be faster, but does it help with DBs like LevelDB? In theory it is likely fast, but in practice it depends on the DB and things like pre-loading the data into a cache or performing computations while pre-loading the data. In geth it may not make a difference because of the way LevelDB works. [Alexey Akhunov volunteered to do some benchmarks to answer some of these questions](https://github.com/ethereum/pm/issues/28#issuecomment-352021812).

### [[31:07](https://youtu.be/naPA7tjrgsk?t=1867)] e. [Vitalik has some ideas around gas cost changes and scalability-relevant client optimizations.](https://github.com/ethereum/pm/issues/28#issuecomment-350941632)
Main point: Vitalik thinks state reads are underpriced and pointed out some other scalability improvements that are quick wins.

> 1. Increase the price of blockchain reads.
> 2. [EIP 648: Parallelization](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/648).
> 3. Two account destroying/dust clearing EIPs ([168](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/168)/[169](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/169)).

Martin HS wondered what the impact of increasing price on blockchain reads would have on the amount of gas used per block and fill up blocks more quickly. Vitalik says that he thinks the purpose of re-pricing is to improve the worst case rather than the average case. We still need to encourage devs to write their contracts better, but the more important thing is being pro-active about risks of actual attacks on the network. Risk of attack on the network is lower this year compared to last year. An attack that fills even a third of the block gas limit would end up making TX fees rise to $2 or more and burn through a million of dollars in a few days, but is still something worth being concerned about.

State channels are something that is a non-protocol, off-chain solution for scaling that Dapp developers should be paying attention to.

## [[35:52](https://youtu.be/naPA7tjrgsk?t=2152)] 3. [Plans on Quantum-resistant cryptography and any plans to include it in the next update?](https://github.com/ethereum/pm/issues/28#issuecomment-350954470).
Account abstraction is not ""necessary"", but there isn't really a point on creating a single quantum proof algorithm, but using account abstraction would make it more general and what they are using for Casper. There is [an Ethereum Research thread going on talking about the tradeoffs in account abstraction that needs more commentary](https://ethresear.ch/t/tradeoffs-in-account-abstraction-proposals/263).

## [[38:32](https://youtu.be/naPA7tjrgsk?t=2312)] 4. [Introduction to KEVM team (Everett H.)](https://github.com/kframework/evm-semantics)
Everett Hildenbrandt, Daejun Park, and Phil Daian gave introductions to themselves and KEVM.

KEVM is a formalization of the EVM in the K language. K is an operational semantics framework that gives you a bunch of software dev tools once you formalize your language in K. KEVM is executable and testable so it can generate and pass state tests. It can be eventually used to generate test cases by the specification rather than by a client such as cpp-ethereum. Some experimental prototypes to extend the EVM with some high-level languages have occurred, most recently Daejun has been helping a lot on the semantics of Viper. Goal is to provide some formal tools for the Viper language which involves formalizing the Viper language on top of KEVM (translating the Python version of Viper into a mathematically definition in K). A number of tools are created from this formalization of Viper including proving compiler correctness and migration of Solidity contracts into Viper using bytecode comparison. More information is included in [this blog post](https://runtimeverification.com/blog/?p=617). Additionally there has been work on compilation from KEVM to a web based and human readable documentation of the KEVM semantics. It is meant to be like the Yellow Paper, but it can be fully compiled into a full implementation of the EVM. It is called ""The Jello Paper"" and [can be found here](https://thehydra.io/evm/). The KEVM project is split across two entities: The University of Illinois (U.S) and Runetime Verification Inc.

## [[47:12](https://youtu.be/naPA7tjrgsk?t=2832)] 5. [Follow-up: Does it remain the case that the Yellow Paper is intended to be Ethereum's formal specification?](https://github.com/ethereum/pm/issues/27#issuecomment-347997598).
Ben Edgington from Consensys's Pegasys protocol engineering team and Daniel Ellison from Consensys who has been working on LLL and language research introduced themselves.

Afri reached out to Gavin about the Yellow Paper and Gavin said he would be happy to place the Yellow Paper under a Creative Commons license. He hadn't done it yet because he has been busy, but will find time in 2 weeks to do it. The topic was brought up of the possibility of having more than 1 formal specification for Etheruem. KEVM is testable and executable so if there were to be another executable or testable specification you could check interoperability between two specifications, but currently there is a not a way to do this with the Yellow Paper. It would be possible to get a merge of the two specifications, combining elements, such as the English prose from the Yellow Paper with some of the elements of the KEVM. It isn't necessarily bad to have multiple specifications, but it would be bad to have it too fragmented. The first step for the Yellow Paper seems to be to apply a license so it can get up-to date. The KEVM team is interested in moving KEVM to Ethereum Foundation ownership.

## [[57:36](https://youtu.be/naPA7tjrgsk?t=3456)] 6. [Parity stuck ether proposals](https://paritytech.io/blog/on-classes-of-stuck-ether-and-potential-solutions-2.html).
No official/formal statement today, but Parity has heard the community feedback loud and clear.

## [[58:27](https://youtu.be/naPA7tjrgsk?t=3507)] 7. POA Testnet unification [Update]
No updates.

## [[9:29](https://youtu.be/naPA7tjrgsk?t=569)] 8. Core team updates.

- Parity - Parity is replacing RocksDB with a custom database layer called ""ParityDB"". Attempts to optimize RocksDB over the last 6 months proved to not be fruitful so they are making the switch. More information on that can be found on their GitHub. We are having some problems keeping up with mainnet, but are working to fix that.
- geth - Nick has been working some potential improvements to not write as much to disk with the idea to keep the state diffs of the last 100 or so blocks in memory (similar to Parity) which would raise memory requirements, but decreases disk I/O. geth is exploring other database solutions and so far hasn't found any silver bullet DB replacement. Although doing some optimizations like disabling the background miner would help, there are some people who rely on the ""pending state"" details that the miner enables for APIs.
- cpp-ethereum - No major updates. Work in progress on refactoring the database layer to easily swap databases and enable optimizations. Recently implemented a script to proxy HTTP RPC request to IPC sockets in order to get rid of the HTTP server in the client. This code can be used with other clients. Improvements have been implemented in the CLI.
- ethereum-js - No updates. Looking forward to EWASM testnet. Lots of maintencance and merging of PRs.
- Harmony - Database layer is almost done being moved from LevelDb to RocksDB. Created a new pruning mechanism. Soon will focus on the Casper testnet.
- pyEVM - No major updates. Getting closer to major alpha release.
- pyethapp - No updates.

**NOTE: The next core dev meeting will be January 12th due to the holidays. [Agenda is located here](https://github.com/ethereum/pm/issues/29).**

[GitHub agenda for meeting](https://github.com/ethereum/pm/issues/23).

**Reminder: Metropolis is now split into 2 hard forks: ""Byzantium"" first and then ""Constantinople"".**

## 1. Metropolis updates/EIPs.

### a. Any ""subtleties"" or questions we need to work out.

  - [4:00](https://youtu.be/gxtftZB7_jA?t=240) [EIP #603: Add ECADD and ECMUL precompiles for secp256k1](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/603). See [this comment](https://github.com/ethereum/pm/issues/22#issuecomment-326927267) for details and request to add to Constantinople. [Matthew D.]
    - Resolution: Will re-approach this item once Matthew D. is on the call next time.

### b. Updates to testing.

  1. [5:11](https://youtu.be/gxtftZB7_jA?t=311) status/statusCode in receipts (eth rpc) [Arkidiy/Martin H.S]
    - Resolution: status will be used.
  2. [6:10](https://youtu.be/gxtftZB7_jA?t=370) Hive tests update
    - Update: Going pretty good. geth has a few failures due to how empty accounts are handled, but this shouldn't be a problem in the future.
    - Parity and cpp are doing well on Hive and most of the errors are for small reasons. 
    - The one thing is that difficulty tests (outside of Hive) are lacking, but some of the testing team is working on it. ethereumJ is working on RLP and other tests before they begin Hive integration.
    - There is no work on pyethapp integrating with Hive currently, but there is work ongoing to get the block tests to work with pyethereum.
    - Pre-compile accounts on testnet and mainnet have been filled with at least 1 wei to avoid weird Spurious Dragon account #3 bug.
  3. [10:40](https://youtu.be/gxtftZB7_jA?t=640) Testnet launch update.
    - Byzantium fork on the Ropsten Ethereum testnet was successful.
    - We verified the zk-SNARK of a Zcash transaction on the testnet.
    - There is (or was) an attack on the Ropsten network. The block gas price on Ropsten was pushed down to 50gwi to mitigate the attack and that seems to have helped. The attack seems fairly inconsequential, but shows that Ropsten is a good test-bed for real world attacks.

### c. Details and implementations of EIPs.

1. Implementation Updates
  - **geth** [13:58](https://youtu.be/gxtftZB7_jA?t=838) - [No updates.](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/issues?q=label%3Ametropolis+is%3Aclosed).
  - **Parity** [14:22](https://youtu.be/gxtftZB7_jA?t=862) - [No major updates](https://github.com/paritytech/parity/issues/4833).
  - **cpp-ethereum** [14:36](https://youtu.be/gxtftZB7_jA?t=876) - [No updates](https://github.com/ethereum/cpp-ethereum/issues/4050).
  - **ethereumJ** [15:21](https://youtu.be/_5Tp_U1jBww?t=882) - [Passing all transition tests in Ropsten so things are good.](https://github.com/ethereum/ethereumj/issues/923).
  - **ethereumJS** [15:50](https://youtu.be/gxtftZB7_jA?t=950) - [Progress moving forward. Rolling out Byzantium changes soon in order to full sync. Passing nearly all of the Byzantium tests](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-vm/issues/209).
  - **yellowpaper** [16:32](https://youtu.be/gxtftZB7_jA?t=992) - [No updates.](https://github.com/ethereum/yellowpaper/issues/229).
  - **pyethapp** - Whoops, forgot to ask pyethapp team.
  - **Swarm** [17:39](https://youtu.be/gxtftZB7_jA?t=1059) - Implementing mounting volumes in Unix and adding Dropbox-like features. Web based file manager is built. Main missing feature is encryption of files on Swarm and that is being actively worked on. http://swarm-gateways.net has more info.

### d. Review time estimate for testing/release of Byzantium.

  - [23:36](https://youtu.be/gxtftZB7_jA?t=1416) Testnet has been running smoothly so far since the fork to Byzantium.
    - We discussed picking block number 4.35mil (Oct. 9th), 4.36mil (Oct. 13th), 4.37mil (Oct. 17th), or 4.4mil (Oct. 27th) for the mainnet fork.
    - Even though block number 4.36mil would be falling on a neat date, it would fall on a Friday so if things go wrong we'd have to work through the weekend. Also, Friday 13th is spooky and has bad luck associated. /s
    - Block number 4.4mil is very close to Devcon so that is not a good date.
    - We need some time to tests the new features and assure that clients stay in sync.
    - Unlike previous hard forks there is not an emergency or attack going on so we can be more conservative on the release date.
    - **The Ethereum mainnet fork for Byzantium will occur at block number 4.37mil (roughly Oct. 17th)** in order to give more time for testing.
    - The fork date/block number may be changed if major issues are found.

## 2. [EIP 706: Snappy compression for devp2p](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/pull/706) - ""very simple change yet reduces sync bandwidth by 60-80%.""

  - [38:44](https://youtu.be/gxtftZB7_jA?t=2324) - EIP discussion on Github has wrapped up.
    - Although there is a small amount of disagreement about implementing Snappy compression at the protocol, rather than a subprotocol level, all parties have agreed to move forward with the EIP because a majority are for it.
    - Reddit comments from /u/alsomahler were discussed and Peter addressed their concerns. [Click here for the Reddit comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/6ywatn/notes_from_todays_ethereum_core_developer_meeting/dmqqmcb/).

## 3. [46:52](https://youtu.be/gxtftZB7_jA?t=2812) [EIP: 152 - BLAKE2b `F` Compression Function Precompile ](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/152) [Zooko]
  - Zooko wasn't able to make the call, but he wants to propose moving forward with the BLAKE2b EIP to include it as a pre-compile in Ethereum citing it's speed and compactness.
  - He wants to use it to create more efficient zk-SNARKs to make proving times lower. Can help improve things like zero knowledge token transfers and more efficient interactions between the Ethereum and ZCash chains.
  - Can be added in either Constantinople or Serenity.
  - In the call, no one voiced opposition to adding it, but questioned what different primitives would enable what integrations cross chain.
  - Clients still need to look and see how easy/hard it would be to implement BLAKE2b in their client.
  - Hudson will be working with Tjaden (original EIP author) and Jay from the ZCash team to update the EIP to the newest standard.

## 4. [51:20](https://youtu.be/gxtftZB7_jA?t=3080) [EIP 718: Concurrency and locks for storage](https://github.com/ethereum/pm/issues/23#issuecomment-331381293)
  - Anti-reentrency related EIP.
  - Will discuss more in next meeting after investigating it more.

## 5. [55:49](https://youtu.be/gxtftZB7_jA?t=3349) [EIP 215: Bitwise shifting](https://github.com/ethereum/pm/issues/23#issuecomment-331443964)
  - EIP was basically approved in a previous core dev meeting.
  - EIP is now final.
  - Greg will merge it in the EIPs repo.

## 6. [1:00:34](https://youtu.be/gxtftZB7_jA?t=3634) [Account abstraction discussion](https://github.com/ethereum/pm/issues/23#issuecomment-331453630) - ""I think we should also slowly bring up account abstraction again. How do the toolset providers think about it? Did we find better solutions in the meantime?""

## 7. [1:01:00](https://youtu.be/gxtftZB7_jA?t=3660) [""Some way to reduce the gas costs for an SSTORE if that slot (or the whole contract) is destroyed at the end of the transaction (""ephemeral storage"").""](https://github.com/ethereum/pm/issues/23#issuecomment-331454160)
  - Related to 718 and we can discuss it in future meetings.

## Off Topic:
- [1:02:15](https://youtu.be/gxtftZB7_jA?t=3735) ERC Process: How Does It Work?
  - Hudson, Casey, and Greg discussed what our view of the process is (as editors of the EIPs). We all agree we need to discuss this further and get a more well defined process, but so far ERCs are approved/finalized once the community members who benefit from the ERC and thought leaders come together, agree on an ERC spec, and implement the spec.
  - 2 good examples of this is [ERC-190 - ETHPM](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/pull/203) and [ERC-20](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-20-token-standard.md).
  - We are open to proposals on how to define the process for approving ERCs (you can reach out to Hudson Jameson (/u/Souptacular on Reddit or hudson@ethereum.org) with suggestions.

- [1:06:14](https://youtu.be/gxtftZB7_jA?t=3974) Discussion on the difficulty tests.
  - The testing team will be taking the discussion offline to decide how clients should collaborate on making difficulty tests more flexible.

[WeTRUST.io] Building an alternative and more inclusive financial system with Ethereum,"Hi friends at r/Ethereum, 

I’m launching a crowdsale to build an alternative more inclusive financial system. So how did I get here? I’ve been passionate about financial inclusion and macroeconomics since way back in college. And even though I started research into cryptocurrency, it never crossed my mind that there would be an opportunity to merge these two concepts. That is, until I learned about Ethereum. 6 Months ago, I stopped trading in ICOs and embarked on this journey to use blockchain technology, to create an alternative financial system that leverages social capital, trust networks, and blockchain. One that is fair and enables individuals to form their own decentralized lending circles -- think of them as your own decentralized credit unions that are ran by, and for the users. 

After making my first post on this sub-reddit (http://bit.ly/2kfX5lU) a few months ago, we have grown from just 2 to a team of 20 that are passionate about the mission to create an alternative. An alternative to the current system which has deviated significantly from serving customers, to one that serves itself primarily. Here’s our vision video: http://bit.ly/2kByJUo.

Similar to the buy local movement, we believe that our robust and strong tools can enable a ‘bank local’ movement for those with access to banks. More importantly, this will help the 2 Billion+ unbanked and underserved leapfrog traditional “physical” banking via branches, and bank on the blockchain - and directly leverage their existing resources to help improve the quality of healthcare, education, and economic prospects. This allows them to tap into and leverage their strengths to achieve greater economic growth.

We’ve assembled an excellent team composed of veterans including ex-Google developers, Fin-Tech experts, former Ethereum miners, and more well-known experts in their respective fields such as Emin Gun Sirer, Michael Casey, and Michael Hexner.  We are all united by a common passion for social impact thru technology - and we’re launching a crowdsale to help fulfill this vision to increase financial inclusion, and hope you can join us on this mission. 

Please check out our presentation: http://bit.ly/2ldUeOa, and our Whitepaper: http://bit.ly/2ijndip.

Most importantly, join our slack: https://www.wetrust.io/slack-invite so we can hear your suggestions and share more information about the crowdsale!

We will also be doing an AMA soon, so please feel free to comment below and stay tuned!

Thank you,

Patrick

ELI5 How ZCash and Etheruem are going to work symbiotically with each other.,I'm struggling to understand how the team at ZCash and Ethereum are working together? Is Ethereum looking to somehow merge the ZkSnark technology? Or are the ZCash tokens going to somehow merge with Ethereum's blockchain? I'm just confused with the whole matter and was wondering if someone could please simplify it for me.,28.0,2017-01-29 20:24:03,0.83
Mastering Ethereum has completed copy-edits and is heading to the printers (and e-printers) by December,"Mastering Ethereum just completed the copy-edit process. It's in final production and heading to distribution by the end of November. Pre-order copies will start shipping from Amazon around the end of November, new orders by Dec 10th.

The book is twice as long as originally planned (400+ pages from 200). It has some gaps, due to the constant changing nature and sprawling breadth of Ethereum as a topic, but we'll have to address those in a second edition. Overall, I'm very happy with the result and I hope it serves to help thousands of developers get started and learn how to ""Master"" Ethereum.

Video starts at [[2:57](https://youtu.be/GhUtruRZOlo?t=2m57s)].

## EIP process improvements [[3:59](https://youtu.be/GhUtruRZOlo?t=3m59s)]
- Want a channel where it's easy for people to communicate about what changes they want to happen
- There is a group called Fellowship of Ethereum Magicians (Hudson to post link), self-organizing group to maximize technical opportunities
  - Like IETF for Ethereum, self-organized group of engineers, scientists, technologists who ""keep things running"" - make sure all of our equipment speaks the same protocol, etc.
  - Will do a workshop at EthCC
  - Jamie Pitts, Greg Colvin have organized
- Will Yoichi be a part of the governance process going forward? A chance he will join again in the future.
- Nick: We need to distinguish between writing a standard and adopting it
  - IETF: Consensus is not about majority votes
  - Hard fork is the final option
  - Can we publish things and let people choose whether to support them or not?
  - Firm up the process of what is considered merged, and the technical requirements of EIP editors
  - Make it clear to everyone involved that EIP writing is a technical process, and that if something is merged it does not mean that it will ever be adopted
  - In short, if something is technically well written, it should be merged but may never be adopted
- Greg: we don't have a good way to keep technical issues separate from policy issues
  - It's difficult to move forward with proposals if we're overwhelmed with debate about the wisdom of a proposal before editing, drafting, merging complete
  - There should not be huge debates about whether this EIP should be assigned a number, it should not be so contentious
- [IETF article from Hudson](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-resnick-on-consensus-01)
- Avsa: not merging things until all objections addressed? This is very hard, same objection can be made in different language
  - We could add an obligatory section on every EIP where you list every main objection and address each one somehow
  - In practice it's hard to separate tech proposals from policy proposals as Greg suggested
  - Maybe we should not merge things that we never want to become standards
  - Greg response: things can become a draft, drafts don't have an EIP number. Once it's a draft it can be accepted, deferred, rejected, etc.
- Greg: we need a body where we can have these arguments in a civil, deliberative way; doing this esp. at the pre-draft stage in Github comments is not the right forum
- Tim: NEO voting
  - They have an electoral system
  - Some people verify their addresses and then they have more authority with their votes
- Vitalik: In general I dislike allowing coin votes for anything
  - Random people who happen to have a lot of ETH are not necessarily the people who have strong technical opinions
  - For things that don't pass developer consensus or have tradeoffs, as much as Carbon Votes are problematic, they're one of the least bad mechanisms we have, esp. in combination with other types of community polling
  - But I do also feel that rather than only invoking for very controversial stuff like the DAO fork and issuance reduction, maybe we should use it for everything
  - Carbon Voting has its flaws and should not be a sole signal but it's been used twice, and it's okay to listen to as long as you recognize that it's one of several signals
  - Avsa: 100 people responsible for 80% of the voting power, this is inevitable due to power distribution of tokens and voter apathy
  - Tim: as Ethereum becomes more popular you'll get more random feature requests
  - Vitalik: decision markets are hard because choosing a single objective function is hard--I don't believe it's ETH price
  - We can return to this in 2-3 years if Maker DAO and other projects find that it's working for them
- Vitalik: In general, our governance mechanism is really not that bad, the main flaw is not so much in the mechanism itself but in how we communicate them
  - E.g. re: standardized ETH recovery, the impression that a lot of community members got from the outside is that if it's merged, it's a lot closer to being accepted than anyone involved in the decision-making process intended to signal that it is
  - Hudson: can make this clearer, add a disclaimer: ""Just because this has been merged does not mean it is any closer to being accepted, this is just a draft.""
- Nick: Some people suggest we should not formalize governance because then it will be vulnerability to exploit capture, etc.
  - But I am concerned that not formalizing it could have the same outcome
  - Hudson: We need some degree of formalization, but maybe not too strict, e.g. these calls
  - Vitalik: Agree that having these calls is good, giving relative indications about status of various EIPs, etc., but then just because everyone on the call agrees an EIP is good it should not 100% necessarily be approved
- Avsa: Someone opened an EIP, was probably a joke, can you have one standard negating another? Both can be drafts!

## Constantinople [[32:15](https://youtu.be/GhUtruRZOlo?t=32m15s)]
- On last call, we decided that some EIPs could definitely go in
  - [EIP 145: Bitwise shifting instructions in EVM](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-145.md): pretty well-formed, but not 100% implemented or tested
  - [EIP 210: Blockhash refactoring](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/pull/210) [[32:40](https://youtu.be/GhUtruRZOlo?t=32m40s)]
    - Replace BLOCKHASH opcode, but also has the feature that you can invoke the contract directly to gain access to > last 6 blockhashes
    - Can access any previous block from the current block in the maximum of three merkle hops
    - Difficulty to implement? Vitalik: There is already an implementation in at least a couple of clients, just need to write a bunch of tests for it.
    - Martin: Not that difficult to implement in the client, but is the actual contract code finalized?
    - Paweł: I would like to see the spec finished, but I made some comments/amendments months ago and haven't had an answer. It should be merged as a draft so I can PR to fix some issues.
    - Hudson: Vitalik please make final changes to the EIP and merge it
    - Vitalik: Please look through it again and make sure there are no issues. I'd like someone independent to write some tests for it. Prefer not to merge until the EVM code as written is very very close to final.
    - Paweł: There is at least one bug in the contract. Would be easier if the code is merged so I can send PR rather than just discuss in the comments.
  - [EIP168](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/168), [169](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/169) - Killing dust accounts, replay protection for this [[42:20](https://youtu.be/GhUtruRZOlo?t=42m20s)]
    - [Andrei's graph](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/168#issuecomment-364066940)
    - [Alexey Akhunov data](https://medium.com/@akhounov/more-data-for-eip-168-kill-dust-accounts-83e8dd0938d3)
    - Alexey did some tests, ~1M accounts, roughly less than half the accounts in the state are zero balance
    - Should this go into Constantinople?
    - Vitalik: I'm not concerned about arguments about deleting people's money since this would only delete the account if at the end of a transaction it has less than gas_price x 21,000, can only increase the cost of a transaction by more than a factor of 2-epsilon
    - V: I prefer variant B
    - Nick: if someone sends a tx with a very high gas price they risk losing that amount of gas x 2
    - Martin: we should set a hard limit in the protocol, this would be less risky
    - Casey: unclear how much benefit clearing the dust accounts would have; per Andrei's post, state goes from ~9.6 to ~7.3 gb (~2.3gb savings)
    - Vitalik: state size control is important not just for saving disk size but also reducing fast sync time, also the bigger the state, the less you can keep in memory which makes DoS attacks worse
    - Nick: if we decide not to clean up existing dust accounts but set a rule going forward, we can do the dynamically-adapting thing without risking attacks
    - Hudson: good idea if we can't decide whether savings are worth it for the risk
    - Casey: nonce replay protection scheme might also make it more difficult to do later sharding approaches with nonces and merkle proofs
    - Vitalik: keep in mind that this will not apply to abstracted accounts (if we do account abstraction) anyway since they will all have code
    - If a few years from now the state space is 3x bigger due to abstracted accounts the actual gain here goes down to maybe 7-8%, in which case maybe that development time would be spent on Casper or sharding
    - Vitalik: there are intermediate versions we can consider, e.g., if at some point we upgrade tx formats, it would be a great opportunity, 2-3x simpler to implement a one time account clear of some kind, but this is a longer-term thing
    - Nick: re: EIP169, how do you sign a tx, wouldn't you need to know which block it will be included in?
      - V: an account going from non-existent to existent is not something the owner of an account can do
      - You can only send a tx from an account that already exists
    - Nick: we could do 169 without 168 initially
      - New nonce scheme, gives people a chance to adapt to that
      - In a later fork, implement dust cleanup which requires it
    - Tim: does account abstraction supercede this?
      - Vitalik: account abstraction only applies to new accounts
    - Avsa: people who have moved ETH to WETH would not be affected by this as there is no dust cleaning for tokens
      - Martin: don't think people would mind if dust is cleaned, most of it is probably from people who tried to move all ETH out of an account but didn't use Javascript bigints and didn't get the math exactly right
    - Hudson: no clear agreement on this so let's move on
  - [EIP859: account abstraction](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/859) [[58:42](https://youtu.be/GhUtruRZOlo?t=58m42s)]
    - Last time we agreed to table this and focus on things like Casper
    - Vitalik: This will happen anyway inside sharding, it will exist in some clients in some form; at some point the code will be mostly written but that's still some time away
      - It's a fairly substantial undertaking, esp. because of things like miner strategies
      - So if we try to do it very quickly (in time for next hard fork) we don't get the benefit of piggybacking on work being done on sharding side
      - Personally I would therefore lean towards not putting this into Constantinople
      - Main reason to do this would be some urgency for some particular applications that could take advantage of abstraction, but there may also be simpler kludges to provide it with off-chain protocols
    - Hudson: as discussed last time, too much work for Constantinople but should be reassessed after Constantinople esp. depending where sharding is at that point
  - [EIP232: New tx formats](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/232) [[1:02:18](https://youtu.be/GhUtruRZOlo?t=1h2m18s)]
    - Creates two new types of transactions
    - Vitalik: overview
      - Superset of earlier abstraction proposal
      - Chain ID replay protection against ETC chain
      - We had to do a series of kludges for this
      - This got a bit too complicated
      - The idea was to make a clean, new type of tx where the first number would always be a transaction version number, second value the network ID, then from there it depends on transaction version number
      - Benefit: way more forward compatible
      - Would be convenient to do at the same time as account abstraction, if not adding any new tx types then we're not getting much benefit, whereas if done at the same time, it makes sense because there is an some actual, new tx format
    - Hudson: okay, so this doesn't need to go into Constantinople either
  - Timing [[1:05:44](https://youtu.be/GhUtruRZOlo?t=1h5m44s)]
    - [EIP 145: Bitwise shifting instructions in EVM](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-145.md) - agreed upon
    - [EIP 210: Blockhash refactoring](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/pull/210) - need to work on some more, but going in direction of being approved for the next hard fork
    - Are there other things we want to add? Or should we just continue to focus on casper and sharding?
      - Vitalik: We should consider a substantial reduction in gas costs of curves, ZK-snarks opcodes, this would be a fairly trivial EIP to put into the hard fork
        - Actual numbers are in [benchmarking repo](https://github.com/ethereum/benchmarking)
          - CPP, Geth, Parity covered
          - But not necessarily using the same test vectors in all cases
          - Geth has the most compehensive test benchmarks
        - karalabe: performance is about 18x faster than current implementation, so if we can implement that then gas costs can go down significantly
          - Go was slower of implementations
          - So if we get 16-18x faster how does that compare to other clients?
          - Dmitrii: we do not have these benchmarks for EthereumJ
    - If we can finalize this stuff over next month or so, we can lock in dates for testing Constantinople
      - Also tied to first Casper implementation
      - Would be good for clients to add this to their roadmaps

# EIP648: Easy parallelizability [[1:13:29](https://youtu.be/GhUtruRZOlo?t=1h13m29s)]
  - https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/648
  - Tim: Wondering if you guys think it's important enough to start considering
  - Similar to introducing a new tx type for [EIP232: New transaction formats](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/232)? Not quite
  - Vitalik: New tx type is cosmetic whereas parallelizability requires changes to protocol guarantees and architecture
    - Pretty sure this could open us up to call stack depth attacks
    - Deep changes are the parts that include actually parallelizing contract execution
    - It's totally fine for people to try implementing but I'm curious realistically how you would test this and what info you would get from the test
  - Tim: I'm also wondering, which client would be good for making a branch for this
  - Vitalik: Use a pretty simple algorithm to retroactively assign lists to previous tx
    - Try to run in parallel and see what the speed up is
    - Call stack depth attack: when an attacker creates a tx which calls a contract, which calls itself a bunch of times and then calls a target contract, but when the target tries to call out to something else it fails because call stack depth too high
      - In current parallelizability proposals a contract has to specify a list of addresses it can call, any attempt to go outside that range leads to an immediate exception
      - So it also lets you make a tx which calls some contract, if it will call another contract then the second degree call could be outside the access list so it would fail
      - Casey: so if a contract assumes its calls always succeed, that would be the vulnerability
      - V: You cannot assume a call succeeds and need to handle the case where it fails
      - We did come up with a bunch of other countermeasures before fixing this issue
  - Hudson: need to explore this more before the next core devs meeting
  - Martin: parallelizability definitely will not go into Constantinople since it requires large changes
  - Casey: until we know bottleneck about disk I/O and how to optimize it, this EIP doesn't make it possible to increase block gas limit without some of the other disk I/O optimizations that are being explored with e.g. TurboGeth
    - TurboGeth disk I/O optimizations are therefore the most important things to work on prior to this EIP
  - Hudson: Not going into Constantinople

A plain english explanation on what to expect from Ethereum 2.0,"Seven years after Vitalik Buterin published the Ethereum whitepaper in 2013, Ethereum has evolved into a thriving financial ecosystem. In 2020, the network is on pace to settle nearly $1 trillion in annual transactions for the first time, and currently supports over $100B in assets and tens of thousands of applications.

Despite Ethereum’s undeniable success, its aspirations are loftier still. It aims to secure a significant base of the global economy, all while remaining globally accessible to individual users at its base layer. Achieving this under Ethereum’s current throughput of 15 transactions per second is simply not feasible.

Ethereum 2.0 is a major network upgrade, years in the making, that if successful will scale Ethereum’s throughput by more than 1,000x, without sacrificing decentralization. It will also transform the network’s native asset, ETH, by bestowing it with new properties while bringing its long term inflation rate down below 1%.

With the numerous layer-1 competitors eying Ethereum’s market share and the recent surge in DeFi activity pushing Ethereum to its limits, the stakes could not be higher.

The first major phase of ETH 2.0 will kick into high gear tomorrow at 12pm UTC (7am EST) with the launch of Phase 0 and the Beacon Chain.

**Phase 0**

Ethereum 2.0 essentially boils down to creating a new blockchain from scratch with a new consensus mechanism (proof of stake) and new architecture (sharding) before porting all of Ethereum’s existing applications to the new chain without disruption.

The **Beacon Chain** is Ethereum 2.0’s proof of stake blockchain. Where Ethereum is currently secured via Proof of Work miners, the Beacon Chain will be secured through Proof of Stake **validators.** Where proof of work involves running specialized hardware that consume vast quantities of electricity, proof of stake requires downloading some software and committing a stake of 32 ETH to a smart contract.

While the launch of the Beacon Chain will capture much of the excitement in the near future, outside of bootstrapping a network of proof of stake validators, this chain will have little functionality. Sharding and smart contract support will not be introduced until later phases.

Before Ethereum can port existing applications over to Ethereum 2.0, it’s next phase will need to launch which won’t occur until a year from now at the earliest.

**Phase 1**

Once Phase 0 has been completed and ETH 2.0’s validator set is firmly in place, **Phase 1** will implement new architecture for how the Beachon Chain stores data, called sharding.

Currently, Ethereum full nodes must store a full history of every transaction that’s ever occurred and process every new transaction on the network. This makes running a full node onerous and is a primary source of Ethereum’s scaling woes.

Sharding will subdivide Ethereum’s Beacon Chain into 64 pieces, or “shards”. Where nodes currently store data for the entire blockchain, each shard will have its own subset of nodes processing it. Sharding alone will scale Ethereum’s throughput by 64x.

Even when sharding is implemented (possibly around this time next year), the entire Ethereum ecosystem will continue to run in parallel on the proof of work chain.

**Phase 1.5 - “The merge”**

Once Ethereum’s Beacon Chain has a full set of PoS validators securing the network, and the chain has been subdivided into 64 parallel shards, then it will be time to merge Ethereum as we know it today into Ethereum 2.0.

This will be accomplished by merging all of the smart contracts and transaction data from the PoW chain into a shard under the PoS chain. At this point, Ethereum will have successfully transitioned from proof of work to proof of stake.

However, this will not take place until some time until 2022, so the earliest point in which the average Ethereum user today interacts with Ethereum 2.0 is at least one year away.

**Phase 2 (that may never happen)**

When the merge between Eth1 & Eth2 takes place, all of the smart contracting execution will take place within a single shard on Eth2.

The final phase of Ethereum 2.0, Phase 2, involves unlocking smart contract execution across some or all the Beacon Chain’s 64 shards. Additionally, phase 2 may introduce a new virtual machine.

However, this phase may end up being unnecessary with phases 0-1.5 and the adoption of a layer-2 scaling technique called “rollups.” Rollups are a type of layer 2 scaling technology that process transactions independently of the Ethereum blockchain, but settle snapshots of their state to the main chain.

**Rollups + “Phase 1.5” would amount to a \~10,000x+ improvement in network processing capacity over the current state of Ethereum.** This means that if current layer-one protocols embrace rollups, Eth2 as it’s currently laid out may never fully launch, but Ethereum will reach its desired scalability within the next two years.

The messari team has put together a massive report on ETH 2.0 (which was the source of the breakdown). You can get it [here](https://messari.io/road-to-eth2).",26.0,2020-11-30 17:20:20,0.97
