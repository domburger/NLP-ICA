"Ethereum Danksharding explained like you are 12 years old, with wizards, gold coins and magic keys","Now that the Merge is firmly behind us, and that we're deep in the bear market, I think it's time to learn more about the tech behind blockchains.

So today, I'd like to offer an ELI-12 of Ethereum Danksharding, one of the proposed improvement to the network that could help it scale by orders of magnitude.

**Once upon a time...**

Imagine a group of wizards who have the power to create gold coins out of thin air. They are responsible for maintaining the integrity of the coin supply and ensuring that no one can double-spend or counterfeit coins. In order to do this, they must agree on who owns what coins and when transactions occur.  

Now imagine that one day a powerful magical dragon appears and threatens to destroy all the wizards if they don’t agree to split the coin supply in two. The wizards reluctantly agree and create two separate blockchains – each with its own set of rules and regulations – in order to protect themselves from the dragon’s wrath.  

On each blockchain, there is now a group of validators responsible for verifying transactions and maintaining the integrity of the coin supply. These validators are rewarded with newly-created coins whenever they successfully validate a transaction, ensuring that they remain incentivized to keep up their work. 

The result is that Ethereum now exists as two independent blockchains – each with its own set of rules and regulations – but both still using the same underlying technology. This means that users can continue making transactions as before, but now there is an extra layer of security provided by having two separate chains working in tandem. This also allows for faster transaction times since both chains can process transactions simultaneously.   

In summary, Ethereum danksharding is a process which splits Ethereum into multiple independent blockchains in order to provide an extra layer of security while still allowing users to make transactions as before. It works by having validators verify transactions on each chain while being rewarded with newly-created coins for their efforts, thus providing them with an incentive to keep up their work. 

All right everyone, thanks for listening to my story!",34.0,2022-12-04 21:05:53,0.71
The king is dead - long live the king?,"  The European Central Bank recently stated that Bitcoin is being artificially propped up and should not be legitimized by regulators or financial companies as it is more akin to gambling.

This is just another episode in Bitcoin’s history when different authorities declared BTC and crypto in general as a liability, a risk and recommended people to avoid having anything to do with it...

So the king is dead, BTC should be buried and forgotten...? Or is it? And who is there to pick up the crown?

For those present in crypto for longer than two weeks, you already know that BTC and crypto in general have been through some rough patches (between the recent FTX episode, the silk road, Mt Gox, to name just a few) and despite all that, and the bear market, and the Covid-19 outbreak, and the war in Ukraine, there are some impressive amounts of resources that continue to be present in the industry. And I am not talking here about the thrill seekers, the moon chasers, the dreamers of 1000x in 48 hours, I am referring to the idealists, those who believe in Satoshi Nakamoto’s dream of decentralization.

The road to achieving this is similar to what the pioneers experienced while discovering the Wild West – there is no beaten path, every project is trying to find the best and fastest way possible to provide answers to the Trilemma; and there are a lot of projects out there, with different visions, different mining strategies, validation procedures, some of them are L1 blockchains, some of them are design to provide L2 scalability, some of them are designed for gaming, the variety is mind-blowing.

On the other hand, each crypto design tends to bring something unique to the table. The big problem with this is that the different visions behind these projects have created a multi polarized universe: BTC with its followers, ETH with a whole cosmos around it, Polkadot has its own microverse, so on and so forth; and these universes do not communicate with each other. There is a real sense of competition (which is completely normal), but no joint ventures meant to bringing things together for the greater good, basically because of the different visions I was talking about earlier and the different technologies used, not truly compatible with each other.

Thankfully, bridges are being built. Projects are slowly “talking” to each other. Monolithic L1 blockchains develop new capabilities transforming them in modular blockchains rendering them able to adopt multiple technologies that build connections that seemed highly unlikely in the past.

Let’s take Syscoin for example: they managed to build a secure, fast L1 blockchain that relied on UTXO to allow nodes to efficiently verify every transaction on the blockchain. Their Z-DAG innovation is providing near-instant probabilistic security on top of low-cost PoW settlement for assets.

Additionally, the initially monolithic blockchain has been transformed into a dual-chain uniting the best of the UTXO and EVM paradigms in a single network. 

The NEVM chain inherits Bitcoin merge-mined security and full byte-for-byte Ethereum Virtual Machine compatibility. Developers can easily bridge their projects for enhanced security and to take advantage of the Rollux Layer 2 suite (a development present in the 2023 roadmap) and ecosystem.

The Syscoin ecosystem has grown and grown for the last few months despite a fragile economic environment containing anything from NFT platforms (Luxy) to Oracles, dApps, launchpads, Game-fi, Dex, payment platforms, educational apps and so many more. But the project that is currently on the Syscoin road map that gets me excited the most is DAOSYS, a treasury management tool that solves the coordination issue of DAOs by allowing investors to retain control of funds by acting as a multi-signatured Automated Market Maker. This allows participants to selectively deploy funds across DeFi gold-standard protocols such as Aave, Compound, Alchemix, and more.

Now, we can talk…",28.0,2022-12-04 12:37:19,0.98
Catching the scammer through cryptocurrency tracking. OSINT & CRYPTOCURRENCY.,"[***Original text and other information on OSINT is available at>>>>***](https://www.advisor-bm.com/advisorbm-news)

>*His nostrils were permanently flared, as though he sniffed invisible winds of art and commerce.  William Gibson, ""Count  Zero""*

In this article I will show:

How, using the basics of financial investigation and OSINT, we can prove the affiliation of cryptocurrency addresses

How by analyzing the transactions of two or more ETH addresses, we can aggregate them into a cluster (i.e. multiple addresses controlled by the same entity)

How the attacker's economic activity dataset changes once the addresses are clustered together

**Let's get started!**

The most popular onchain detective ZachXBT once posted the following tweet

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/0u6tvys1eq2a1.png?width=740&format=png&auto=webp&s=ca399da7b5a6df5aa632a72e63c6c93acd592673

For those unfamiliar with English, let me explain. Using a phishing site, a hacker gained access to the victim's address and stole 3 ERC-721 tokens (NFT). Immediately after the theft (i.e. after sending the tokens from the victim's address to his address, 0x864875aef79B107221bEE89C8ff393BD2B666d96) the hacker sold the NFT on the marketplace Opensea.io. The criminal profits were then laundered through the Tornado.Cash mixer.

While our hands are itching to get the target address into [https://etherscan.io](https://etherscan.io) sooner rather than later, we'll stop on the shore and turn to the theory. The criminal first stole and then sold tokens that use the Ethereum blockchain infrastructure.

In order to operate the tokens, you need some amount of cryptocurrency to pay transaction fees. In our case it is the Ethereum blockchain, which means you need some ETH to send tokens or sell them.

Let's try to find out where the hacker's address 0x8648... ETH he needed to pay commissions came from.

This line of enquiry is called a source search

Open Etherscan, insert the address, see the first transactions. They will be right at the bottom of the page.

And here are the ones we need: 1, 2. The sender of the funds in the transaction table is always shown on the left of the IN (incoming transaction) or OUT (outgoing transaction) bar

https://preview.redd.it/d95y72t4eq2a1.png?width=740&format=png&auto=webp&s=f09953d33c369b52b270079ac8d177613cf8b75b

So, we have identified the source of the funds, which is address 0xA474cE48300D91334339fb5aDeF99A1B11B1cfe6. What can we extract from this information?

In our case, the first address of the hacker, 0x8648... (aka Fake\_Phishing5435 in the picture above) never received any funds before the transactions we detected. So address 0xa474... is the sponsor address (or funding address) with respect to the hacker address, or 0x8648..., or Fake\_Phishing5435.

Most often the sponsor address is affiliated with a target address. The owner of the sponsor address could be, for example, some customer who has paid for services with crypto. Or, for example, the sponsor address is operated by a cryptocurrency exchange whose services are used by the owner of the target address.

But even more often, both the target address and the sponsor address have the same owner. Let's analyze the transactions of the sponsor address and try to figure out which option would be correct in our case.

The most interesting direction in the case of the sponsoring address is to try to detect suspicious transactions (such as the theft of NFT). To do this, open the address in Etherscan.io and go to ""ERC-721 token Txns"", which is the section responsible for NFT transfers.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/gl3g4us7eq2a1.png?width=740&format=png&auto=webp&s=38de315486e581e0ad96018a633c5499a53852f5

We see four transactions, two incoming, two outgoing. The first NFT, Mutant Ape Yacht Club (MAYC), was sold half an hour after receipt. The second, Azuki, 9 (!) minutes later. Seems suspicious to me!

But how do we prove that these transactions are not a normal sale, but a real theft? By the consequences!

In order to sell MAYC, you have to contact the Opensea marketplace's smart contracts. When you interact with them, the marketplace will automatically generate a profile for you, accessible via a link like ""[https://opensea.io/ETH\_Address](https://opensea.io/ETH_Address)"".

I should also add that Opensea.io actively cooperates with law enforcers and also actively assists victims. In case of hacking, the stolen tokens are blocked and the hacker's account is banned, making his profile inaccessible.

Let's try to open the profile of address 0xa474... and examine the transaction history. To do so, go to [https://opensea.io/0xA474cE48300D91334339fb5aDeF99A1B11B1cfe6](https://opensea.io/0xA474cE48300D91334339fb5aDeF99A1B11B1cfe6).

https://preview.redd.it/1zu3jeaaeq2a1.png?width=740&format=png&auto=webp&s=1eba4c5866e37e8d4bf830bfe386e0ce5d150c39

We now know two facts about the sponsor address: it transferred money to the hacker's address, which was then used as a commission, and also made questionable transactions with NFT, for which it was banned from Opensea.io.

The target address also made questionable transactions with NFT and was banned from Opensea.io.

Now let's find out where the criminally obtained coins were sent to. To do this, let's examine the transactions in chronological order and try to find the incoming transactions immediately after the sale of (possibly) stolen NFTs. In this way, we will determine the amount of criminally acquired funds.

The transactions we are looking for are found in the Internal Txns section:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/k7rxuplceq2a1.png?width=740&format=png&auto=webp&s=578b527637403f319d4ef7685b84c5f20cd85af1

The hacker received a total of 23.8 ETH. To do this, let's examine the transactions in chronological form and try to find the incoming transactions immediately after the sale of (possibly) stolen NFTs. Who else sent the stolen coins to address 0x945b...? Target address!

[Withdrawal transactions of stolen funds highlighted in yellow](https://preview.redd.it/zhxyb1eeeq2a1.png?width=740&format=png&auto=webp&s=d9c1f882ac57e0a25ca69f1e2cc0c51d254255fa)

Let's find out what address 0x945b was used for... To do that, we again study the transactions in chronological order, we are interested in all incoming and outgoing transactions after the address received the stolen funds.

&#x200B;

Target email address (13 ETH) was the first one to receive the stolen funds. Next, address 0x945b accumulated presumably stolen funds from several other addresses, including the target address. The money was then, as ZachXBT wrote, withdrawn to the Tornado.Cash mixer.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/joe68tkieq2a1.png?width=740&format=png&auto=webp&s=ed2bccf4ded6c975cff122b636f260627ffd183f

The money sent to the mixer was grouped into two payments of 100 ETH, of which 125 ETH originally belonged to the target address, 13 ETH to the sponsoring address, and the remaining 62 ETH to other addresses.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/qmyrfstkeq2a1.png?width=740&format=png&auto=webp&s=111ee50fdb5c3318d119b2b963d4c1491d295add

It turns out that either the hacker owns all five addresses and uses 0x945b as an intermediate point before money laundering, or the owner of 0x945b is a separate criminal (money launderer) whose services are used by several criminals at the same time.

Let's briefly examine the other hacker addresses: as you can see from the graph, they too have interacted with NFT on Opensea. Let's use the old vetting method and... one of the addresses is in a ban on Opensea! The second address is not in the ban, but appears in the ZachXBT investigation. Here you can see the names and faces of our heroes, the dangerous cybercriminals.

[Mathys and Camille together](https://preview.redd.it/99djcobmeq2a1.png?width=740&format=png&auto=webp&s=a3f43b0a5dbb201283aae08890db6370b341cbb4)

Well here comes our friends Mathys and Camille from romantic France shitting themselves hard by posting a screenshot of one of their profiles on Opensea with previously stolen NFTs on their personal Twitter. This profile appears in our investigation, on the graph is address 0x5bb51...

Admittedly, I even got a little upset at this stage. How is it, we've only just started and they've already found everyone for us!

But I decided not to dwell on Mathis and Kamila and go a bit further and try to add new factors to my investigation.

Back to the sponsor address. The sponsor address, like most addresses on the Ethereum network, has its own sponsor address (pardon the recursion). Let's find it!

https://preview.redd.it/9wdiw0mqeq2a1.png?width=740&format=png&auto=webp&s=f7b475653d72472731494feef585fd244d10763c

This time the sponsor address is signed in the block browser as Fake\_Phsihing5099. Comments about the affiliation of all the addresses appearing in the investigation seem to me to be redundant with:

Having discovered the new sponsor address I decided to go towards the final destination of the funds and figure out exactly where Fake\_phishing5099 was sending the dirty money.

After looking through all the transactions, I found an interesting address 0x27429f480a3E2a69D7E4D738EBc54AeB4096eb43.

The owner of this address, according to a thread on epicnpc.com, is spamming in Discord (Discord is where many of the victims received the phishing links).

Diwan Nuri (judging by the content of the thread, that's the name of the address owner) was so far-sighted and wise that he registered the forum account with his personal email.

https://preview.redd.it/zr7zckateq2a1.png?width=740&format=png&auto=webp&s=106fe360f80b49108aa561897ea594dd5a5d1d2f

This wasn't enough, so he decided to screw one of his potential clients by sending them his ETH address in addition to the email.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/lik8x0xxeq2a1.png?width=740&format=png&auto=webp&s=8642f9fc54133dab035b73fe41c958bdb0e837e3

According to the record we found, Diwan graduated from German Aletta-Haniel-Gesamtschule and now earns his living by spamming and scamming.

So, after studying 6 cryptocurrency addresses and their transactions, we found out that:

5-6 of the addresses in question were communicating with NFT.

4 six analyzed addresses were involved in illegal activity and got banned at Opensea

4 six investigated addresses were ""skimming"" for the withdrawal of funds to the Tornado.Cash mixer

2/six of the addresses have been implicated in existing investigations

6 addresses have close economic ties

The couch is not as simple as it looks!

In my opinion, the discovered facts are enough to merge the addresses into a cluster. Which addresses do we merge:

Target address 0x864875aef79B107221bEE89C8ff393BD2B66d96

Target Address 0xA474cE48300D91334339fb5aDeF99A1B11B1cfe6

Hackers' complementary address #1 0x38dB16DA44A61560e04E94DCb71c3E64Aa94d318

Hackers secondary address #2 0x5bb5180D8b84d754F56e2BC47Dc742d0f5Ac37FE

The laundering address 0x945b4a77649Ebe89eABAf03F78A0C8993f99bd41

Fake\_Phishing5099 0xdE09020653cA303CFC143d23A18183299558065F

What can we learn after clustering the addresses together?

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/h81dx331fq2a1.png?width=740&format=png&auto=webp&s=6fbf4e6ef9a63fcf75b37b74d8b39db17ef9b219

First, our 'friends made about $1.7M on such a scam. One million was sent to the Tornado.Cash mixer.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/a3uz7zi3fq2a1.png?width=740&format=png&auto=webp&s=437fc555758853fc4f5f11c70e531ae4057fdb8f

Second, just over $300k went to centralised exchanges (those with KYC procedures, cooperating with law enforcement, etc.). $285k went to Coinbase.

Thirdly, we will get a much more detailed list of counterparties of this criminal group, which (as in the case of Couch, for example) can lead to interesting findings. And it could help law enforcement to trace the stolen money back to exchanges and exchanges.

**Conclusions**

As you can see from the material above, cryptocurrency is far from always anonymous. By properly applying OSINT and financial investigation techniques and methods, as well as knowing the theory of cryptocurrency, even large thefts can be successfully investigated, let alone small ones like the one we discussed today.

What can we do concretely?

Look for the source of the funds (sponsor address) and the final destination of the funds. Analyse in detail the transactions of each address in question.

We can cluster the addresses based on this data. This may be done either within the software you are using, e.g. Cheynalisis, or logically.

If the software you have available does not support clustering, I recommend exporting the transactions of the addresses you want from Etherscan.io and then merging multiple tables into one.

After aggregating the addresses into a cluster, in our case we were able to understand the approximate volume of the thefts committed and also find out information about which exchanges the money from those thefts was being withdrawn to. We also learned that around a million dollars had been withdrawn to Tornado.Cash, which is a ready-made money laundering charge in some jurisdictions!

Ethereum fees could be trimmed by a hundred percent as an EIP 4844 upgrade is considered for inclusion,"Have you heard about the most anticipated upgrade to the ETH blockchain since the Merge activation on mainnet called EIP 4844 or Proto-danksharding?  


It's interesting because it is part of Ethereum's rollup-centric scaling roadmap, so many people started discussing how will this affect the price of gas fees, which is actually told that it would be pretty reduced thanks to this upgrade.  


We already are using L2 protocols for these issues. Which one do you use, and which is most helpful/suitable for you? I started with Polygon, but Metis suits me way more.  


What consequences can this upgrade have on L2 protocols?  


It actually reconsiders the data logistics on Ethereum's second-layer scaling solutions with roll-ups to make its usage 10-100x cheaper. Also, as it streamlines data processes, the implementation of Proto-danksharding is set to advance the throughput of the ETH mainnet.  


The exact timeline of EIP 4844 implementation is not known for now. Do you think it will actually occur?",266.0,2022-11-28 00:33:56,0.87
"Layer 2 solutions ZK Rollups, according to Vitalik Buterin, will be the foundation of Ethereum's go-to strategy in the near and mid-term future","We witnessed a watershed moment in cryptocurrency history with the completion of The Merge. The update is expected to increase adoption and reduce energy consumption, making it more environmentally friendly.  


Despite significant progress in recent years, scaling the Ethereum network remains difficult. Which L2 solutions do you use to address the issues presented by ETH?  


L2 solutions ZK Rollups will be the foundation of Ethereum's go-to strategy in the near and medium term, according to Vitalik Buterin. What are your thoughts on the subject?  


Working without Metis, Arbitum, Polygon, or any other long-standing L2 solution has become nearly impossible.  


Scalability is provided by the L2 chain, which allows for faster, cheaper transactions while retaining the primary security of the L1 chain. Protocols frequently use L2 to increase scalability by processing transactions off-chain and sending only essential data back to the mainnet. When trading derivatives, an L2 provides more leverage, more liquidity, and lower transaction costs than an L1. Users must be able to bridge back and forth from Ethereum without any lag or reliance on liquidity providers for it to be effective.

Announcing Unpool.fi - We are taking Ethereum back from staking pools and making it easier to solo stake!,"Hello World!

Today  [VeriHash](https://www.verihash.io) is announcing the closed Goerli beta launch of [Unpool.fi](https://unpool.fi)!

Our mission is to make it easy for **anyone** to stake for themselves while they **keep their keys**,  **keep their crypto**, and **maximize on-chain rewards**. Stakers shouldn't have to give up their own sovereignty, security, or the general health of Ethereum just to participate on-chain easily.

We have been hard at work since early this year and now that Ethereum is post-merge and eyeing withdrawals in 2023 we think it is the perfect time to start talking about our offering.

A Few Highlights:

* MEV smoothing contract for solo stakers
* Cost and complexity reduction; meaning higher effective solo staker returns with less headaches
* Keep control of your keys at all times, never exposing them to us or anyone else in any way...ever
* Retain control of how blocks are built from plain TX pool, to max profit bloxroute relay, to custom MEV strategies, and everything in between
* Lightweight validators using a Raspberry Pi 4

And that is just the start. See the whitepaper on [our website](https://unpool.fi/) for a more detailed roadmap!

**We are seeking intrepid solo stakers who want to join us in a closed Goerli beta to help us build what the community needs.**

**We expect to launch publicly in early Q1 2023.**

Other Important Info:

* Our open letter to the Future of Ethereum: [https://unpool.fi](https://unpool.fi)
* Whitepaper: [https://unpool.fi/whitepaper/unpool\_whitepaper\_v1.pdf](https://unpool.fi/whitepaper/unpool_whitepaper_v1.pdf)

* Follow us on Twitter:  [https://twitter.com/unpoolfi](https://twitter.com/unpoolfi)

We look forward to further engaging with the solo staking community and working with you to build what you need to level the playing field against large node operators and to take Ethereuem's future back for solo stakers.",36.0,2022-11-21 21:37:52,0.89
"Heads up for former Flexpool ETH miners with unpaid balances >0.001 on the pool still - deadline is December 15, 2022","\[Rule 7 disclosure: Flexpool support guy here\]

For any Flexpool Ethereum miners who had at least 0.001 ETH unpaid balance and haven't made arrangements for settings adjustments, there's less than a month left in the 3 month grace period we announced before the Merge. 

December 15, 2022, is the last day for changes, and we don't recommend waiting for the last minute for obvious reasons.

There's a lot more detailed instruction on our post here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/Flexpool/comments/ytkf2q/tminusonemonth\_postmerge\_payout\_warning/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Flexpool/comments/ytkf2q/tminusonemonth_postmerge_payout_warning/)

But in short, put in a ticket (messenger bottom right of [flexpool.io](https://flexpool.io), or email to support@flexpool.io) **with your ETH address**, and desired gas price limit change if any. 

Nobody's had an ETH miner on Flexpool in the past 24 hours (or the past two months for that matter), so the IP for validation will probably not work, and we cannot tell you what it is since it doesn't really exist. 

If you have less than 0.01 (less than 0.005 on Polygon) or want a transfer from the mined-to wallet (which you can sign a digital Ethereum message from) to another address,  you can either provide the info listed in that post, or we'll send the instructions to you as applicable. 

Also note that gas price limits of 1, 5, 7, 12 and other numbers at or below 15 are unlikely to qualify based on the past week's gas prices. A limit of 50 will normally be paid out within an hour, and 20 will be paid out within several hours.",36.0,2022-11-19 18:17:45,0.93
The Ethereum Side Of Syscoin,"Syscoin is the best of Bitcoin and Ethereum. The Ethereum side syscoin brings is EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine) and smart contracts that is scalable. Syscoin calls this NEVM (Network-Enhanced Virtual Machine). 

WHAT IS EVM
The Ethereum Virtual Machine isn't like a single computer operating somewhere, it a cloud computer that is a collection of thousands of computers (nodes), in reality these computers run software that compute smart contract transactions. This Virtual computer processes smart contract code(usually Solidity) written by developers. The EVM does not understand this human code, It instead compiles the code into Opcodes. 
Opcode is a collection of 141 instructions the EVM uses to carryout instructions from developer code. Opcodes usually have a fixed gas cost but some have variable gas costs that depend on transaction traffic. 

WHAT IS NEVM
This is Syscoin's version of EVM with the same smart contract support but with interoperability that can scale and still keep costs low. NEVM also utilises bitcoin's PoW (proof-of-work) security via merge mining. In essence, with NEVM you get the same smart contract capabilities of EVM that is scalable, cheaper and more secure.

Syscoin still has more innovative technology currently on the test. Technology like Rollux, DAOSYS and Rollux. Still around for announcements.",28.0,2022-11-19 16:58:48,0.97
Ethereum turns into first profitable blockchain from Top 10 of Crypto Market,"Prior to the Merge update and the continuous reduction in issuance, Ethereum, like any cryptocurrency network on the market, was the ""unprofitable"" blockchain. However, things have changed.   
 

It's important to note that a blockchain's ""profitability"" is not the same as a company's profitability in traditional finance. Technically, subtracting new issuance from fee burns allows us to determine whether or not the network is profitable.   
 

So, as far as I can tell, the blockchain's profitability benefits neither its holders nor new investors. Deflation, on the other hand, has the potential to be a significant speculative growth factor for cryptocurrency in the future.   
 

However, while the rallying Ethereum will benefit investors and traders, dApps users and developers will be forced to make transactions with higher fees and possible network congestion. Unfortunately, during high network loads, Ethereum requires users to pay up to $15 per network operation.   
 

I remember at the beginning it was quite chaos dealing with transactions and gas fees, I started using Metis from the start, and the discovery of L2 solutions was the greatest discovery for me as far as I can tell lol.    
 

Various foundations and projects, however, are constantly working on Ethereum's scalability by offering new mechanisms for processing transactions or alternative Layer 2 networks that take some of the load off the main network, offering higher throughput, shorter processing times, and low fees.",114.0,2022-11-17 15:47:42,0.88
Crypto's Faustian Bargain,"\[[View on *Medium*](https://medium.com/@Kintsugy/cryptos-faustian-bargain-c4f7a3852e0c)\]

https://preview.redd.it/zzfcsrqrid0a1.jpg?width=2304&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=41ecedab7691985561d25a9fb1fd6f3c9ed7ae19

**Crypto's Faustian Bargain**

When Satoshi Nakamoto introduced Bitcoin, he stated, “It’s completely decentralized, with no central server or trusted parties, because everything is based on crypto proof instead of trust.” Satoshi identified *trust* as a point of failure within our current financial and monetary system, and he has been vindicated time and time again. On the surface, trust is a positive idea. Being able to trust someone is a great thing, and it’s required for healthy relationships. The problems only arise when trust is betrayed, whether it's cheating, spending other people’s money as if it was their own, or regularly debasing a currency, but I repeat myself. The problem staring every one of us in the face is the fact that our relationship with legacy financial institutions is incredibly unhealthy.

Satoshi’s revolutionary idea was not an attack on trust itself, but to remove it from the equation entirely. In so doing, he designed Bitcoin to be *trustless*, thereby making trust in third parties obsolete, at least within our financial system. Bitcoin debuted in the wake of the ‘08 financial crisis, a timely repudiation of a system of banks and firms who leveraged common people’s money to further enrich themselves. When the house of cards came crashing down, these very same institutions were bailed out because they “were too big to fail”, while the little people outside of this category were left with the bill, many losing their homes, jobs, and potential lifetime earnings.

The good news is we have been given an alternative. Bitcoin, and a few other cryptocurrencies who have followed its example, offer something better. “Be your own bank” is not just a catchphrase; it’s a call to action. If you do not approve of the way things are, then it is up to you to be the change you want to see in the world. The construction of an alternative financial system is not going to occur overnight, but every private wallet, every accrual of a decentralized token over a centralized fiat dollar, and every transaction occurring on a blockchain instead of some middleman’s payment channel is a step in the right direction. On the other hand, every choice to sacrifice intrinsic Bitcoin ideals like trustlessness, decentralization, and censorship-resistance is two steps back and an affront to financial sovereignty itself.

**The Invitation**

In folklore, various evil creatures like vampires and some demons can only gain entrance to haunt someone after they receive an invitation. Similarly in German legend, the character Faust sells his soul to the devil in exchange for earthly gain. This ancient trope has been retold many ways, but the moral of the story is sacrificing your ideals ultimately leads to ruin. Despite the popularity of this myth, the crypto community at large remains woefully ignorant of its lesson.

Sam Bankman Fried & FTX could be the proverbial devil in our story right now, but a few months ago it was Do Kwon & Terra Luna or the Celsius Network. At one point it was Bitconnect, before that it was Mark Karpelès & Mt. Gox, and it’s been a million shitcoins, NFT projects, and even whitepapers in between. Although the fallout of the FTX Faustian bargain is still unfolding, it is safe to say these kinds of events will continue until people realize many of Bitcoin’s features are not bargaining chips; they’re non-negotiable.

Perhaps centralized exchanges are a necessary evil, *at least for the time being*. I can accept that. If you can as well, it would be prudent to recognize an exchange is not a wallet. They possess wallets intended to hold their customers’ funds, who must **trust** the exchange not to use said funds like Bankman-Fried did to fuel his [‘effective altruism’ lifestyle to “try and do as much good as you can”](https://www.vox.com/recode/2021/3/20/22335209/sam-bankman-fried-joe-biden-ftx-cryptocurrency-effective-altruism), cover various “business expenses”, donate them to a political war machine founded by his mother, or mint counterfeit Bitcoins like soBTC (wrapped BTC on Solana). “Not your keys, not your coins” remains true. If you hope to have financial sovereignty, it begins by taking responsibility for your own assets. If you are reading this and still have tokens on an exchange, stop reading immediately in order to withdraw them into your own wallet. If you must use a CEX, at least try to use one that publishes audits, and only keep your funds there as briefly as possible.

Exchanges like FTX are an example of how the cryptocurrency industry has been infected by the same wicked spirit that possesses the monetary system Bitcoin was designed to escape. There is a narrative we should be accepting when crypto behaves more like legacy finance, because it gives us some kind of legitimacy, but in the eyes of whom, the same system it was built to be an alternative to?  Thankfully, decentralized exchanges are well on their way to being able to fulfill this necessary role via rollup technology with built-in compliance, as explained by Jagdeep Sidhu.

Bitcoin is more than trustless digital gold, the most secure censorship-resistant decentralized network in existence, adjudicator of truth for the transactions it records. It is the base layer of a new paradigm. It is an idea people do not need to rely on fallible third parties to control the monetary system, that people should be able to make transactions amongst themselves, that we can bank the unbanked, that a decentralized system is more capable of lifting people up rather than egalitarianism somehow trickling down from the top of a pyramid. Sacrificing these ideals for temporal gain is not to be lauded as it is a sign one would rather maintain the status quo than aspire towards something higher, enriching themselves by trampling others.

**Exorcize**

If we hope to achieve the promise of Bitcoin, we must remain vigilant to avoid the devils in our midst. In the same vein of protecting the idea of Bitcoin, we must preserve the standards that make it possible, namely decentralization and security. Any cryptocurrency that sacrifices either for the sake of scale or anything else cannot be fully trusted because it will never be trustless. Solana made this sacrifice to achieve momentary monetary success and look at it now.  Even if it was not inextricably linked to the FTX fiasco, it was never going to be more than a cheap counterfeit of the real deal.

I am not a Bitcoin maxi in the sense that I do not take issue with the very existence of other blockchains. As long as the ideals are preserved, I do not see a problem. Bitcoin provided a solid foundation for us to build on, but there have been many worthwhile innovations made since the Genesis block was mined within and outside of Bitcoin. The most obvious would be the introduction of smart contract functionality introduced by the Ethereum Virtual Machine, which paved the way for decentralized applications and the transition to Web3. However, unlike Bitcoin, Ethereum has become proof-of-stake. Post-Merge, Ethereum’s staking model has brought censorship and ensures those who hold the most ETH, the rich, get richer while the poor get poorer, which only compounds ETH’s inequitable distribution originating from its premine. Smart contract functionality is not incompatible with the Bitcoin ethos. Ethereum itself is another question.

If a superior consensus mechanism arises to challenge Bitcoin’s proof-of-work without sacrifice, then it should be considered, tested, and potentially adopted. In the meantime, there is no need to fix something that isn’t broken. Thankfully, [Satoshi envisioned a multichain ecosystem operating symbiotically through a process called merged mining.](https://blockworks.co/news/pow-isnt-dead-merged-mining-solves-bitcoins-energy-problem/) Merged mining not only shares Bitcoin’s security with others, but also allows Bitcoin to be augmented to support greater functionality. If more projects took advantage of merged mining, they would gain greater security than they could likely achieve on their own and be less tempted to make the expensive sacrifices of ideals that call their value into question. As an added bonus, merge-mined projects effectively become an extension of the Bitcoin ecosystem, so supporting them offers secondary support to Bitcoin as well.

**Ascend**

It’s paramount we avoid projects who have sacrificed Bitcoin’s ideals or made their own deals with the devil, and support honest Bitcoin and projects who preserve Satoshi’s vision, and are working to effect actual positive change. If we hope to avoid the pain caused by making the wrong decision, or worse, the regret that comes from longing for the way things could have been, we cannot set a price on our values. Therefore, may this serve as a lesson for those who did not know any better and a reminder for those who have forgotten. The struggle for decentralized finance is ongoing and there is no foregone conclusion. It is up to each person on an individual level to choose to be the change they wish to see in the world. If we believe in the ideals of Bitcoin, we must not be enamored by the ill-gotten gifts of legacy finance or be willing to sacrifice our ideals for their sake . After all, what does it profit you to gain the whole world, only to lose your soul?

Ethereum (ETH) Analysis,"ETH rejected off its daily 200SMA last week – leading to a bearish sell-off. After bouncing with an oversold RSI, ETH has been consolidating in the same zone that it was throughout most of October ($1200-1300). ETH is showing strength relative to BTC, which is at its lowest point in years. 

ETH’s RSI has been flat, and Stochastic is trending down – a symptom of sideways consolidation. We can see that ETH just closed a candle beneath its weekly 200SMA. This will be an important resistance for ETH to recover-  priced at $1330. In this chart, we can see that ETH is trading well above its summer lows of around $850 – further indicating its strength relative to the rest of the market. 

ETH’s relative strength can be attributed to its radical shift in emissions. In the 60 days since the merge, ETH’s total supply has actually decreased by over 5700 ETH. While this may not sound like much, the old emission model would have added over 700k new ETH in the same time period. This is over $1B worth of ETH that has not hit the market in the last 60 days – a massive decrease in selling pressure.

## Market Sentiment

Sentiment has swung back to “Extreme Fear” but a level of 24 does not capture the extremely fearful sentiment on crypto social media. With investors acting as if crypto has died completely thanks to SBF, scaling into positions at these levels seems like a good r:r.

## Conclusion

It’s been a shocking week, and the insolvency/bankruptcy of FTX is perhaps the most difficult for the industry since Mt. Gox. It is impossible to say for sure if the bottom is in, but BTC is trading near levels that would historically indicate the end of the bear market is close. The biggest unknown right now is how deep the FTX contagion goes – however, CZ’s message that Binance will help projects in a liquidity crunch brings a glimmer of hope. Trade extremely cautiously during this time.

What I’ve Learned About Syscoin: Standing The Test Of Time,"**Introduction: We Have Seen The Worst Collapse In Cryptocurrency History With FTX, What Is There To Learn Here And Now?**

&#x200B;

[ Syscoin: Standing The Test Of Time ](https://preview.redd.it/s70fg9glvyz91.png?width=870&format=png&auto=webp&s=2400ff5693b9f6b754c544a60d95bc7314208a63)

 From an empirical perspective, I have been in the blockchain sphere since 2017; back before government regulations were less restrictive, the libertarian ethos of cryptocurrencies “old days” was more readily apparent, and with it radical notions such as self-custody, self-sovereignty, and banking the unbanked were inevitable in every serious conversation about the potential of blockchain technology like some beautiful, inverse Godwin’s Law that traded an Austrian artist for economics. The past week provided another painful testament to the fact that the blockchain industry has lost its way. Public trust in institutions and centralized exchanges has become contentious, paranoid at best, and completely absent at its worst. The viability of VC backed cryptocurrencies has come into question. Reminiscent of Terra Luna, SBF and FTX are sowing doubt in Solana and many other so called invincible blockchain platforms. All of this is just the latest in the cyclical history of crypto where many projects have meteroic rises and just as spectacular falls. The truth is most projects will rise and then fail. Very few will stand the test of time, and cannot weather one bear market, let alone several. However, I would like to draw your attention to one that has, Syscoin. Syscoin is one of these projects that has not only survived, but thrived by continuing to make industry leading innovations and is paving the way forward by playing the long game but never losing sight of the foundational security inherited from Bitcoin itself.

  The majority of cryptocurrencies have very short shelf-life, these projects come and go just as empires rise and fall. Todays flavor of the week becomes next week’s fertilizer. Blockchains and cryptocurrencies die obly to be replaced by others with superior technology (or marketing campaigns). This is a process of techno- economic-natural-selection. There are very few projects that have stood against the tyranny of time, and one of these projects that I have noticed that still embodies the ideals of what blockchain once stood for is Syscoin for a variety of reasons. 

**Syscoin: Proving Longevity Since 2014: Slow And Steady Winning The Race**

 The simple truth is most blockchains lose relevance in a few years time; as hype can only carry you so far; now this isn’t a ubiquity but it nearly a regular occurrence. Syscoin however, defies this notion. Launched in 2014, Syscoin has consistently been building since its inception and is now building and integrating the changes needed to take blockchain technology to the masses by solving scalability without sacrificng security or decentralization. Syscoin is bringing EVM-compatible rollups, both optimistic and ZK, to the Bitcoin ecosystem. Having adopted a dual-chain architecture, Syscoin simultaneously runs a UTXO-based, Bitcoin compliant chain and their EVM-based, NEVM chain in unison, keeping the best of both and making the necessary upgrades to offer what is basically Ethereum running on Bitcoin’s network. Syscoin is amalgamating the best of Bitcoin and Ethereum while solving the blockchain trilemma: an assortment of solutions.

 One of the most difficult technological issues that cryptocurrency and blockchain have yet to solve is the blockchain trilemma. Solving all three of these key issues, security, scalability and decentralization. Syscoin is aiming to solve all three, beginning with security. Syscoin is merge-mined with Bitcoin and has integrated multi-quorum chain locks which prevents numerous issues that plague blockchains such as selfish mining incidents and has their own NEVM. Syscoin’s NEVM chain inherits Bitcoin merge-mined security and full byte-for-byte Ethereum Virtual Machine compatibility. Developers can easily bridge their projects for enhanced security. Syscoin’s modular architecture provides scalability, efficient throughput and low carbon output. Lastly, Syscoin offers tools that embody both blockchain paradigms; Rollux and Proof-Of-Data Availability for EVM-based assets or contracts, and Z-DAG for UTXO-based assets. These are just a few reasons why I think Syscoin has been able to prove its own sense of personal longevity in an ecosystem where blockchains rise and fall. 

&#x200B;

**Conclusion: Longevity In Blockchain: Syscoin**

Throughout my own personal journey in cryptocurrency, there are very few cryptocurrencies and blockchain platforms that have actually stood the test of time. I have watched blockchains come and go just as trends rise and fall every year. Syscoin is an anomaly from my perspective, it has been around for nearly a decade in an extremely juvenile sphere of technology and yet, it continues to rise and thrive. This is why I believe Syscoin is here to stay.

"Which L2 protocol do you have the most trust in, and why?","We are all aware that, despite being the leading blockchain for developing decentralized apps, Ethereum is frequently chastised for high gas fees and slow transactions; even if the merger occurred, there are some things that should be done.  


Do you use any tools to help you deal with all of these ETH issues? Last week, I read an online article about Layer 2s, and there are a couple of great solutions, some of which I've tried and some of which I'm currently using, which is the scaling protocol Metis. It helps with all of these issues, such as high gas prices and slow transactions, which are, as previously stated, characteristics of ETH.  


Since I read about these protocols, solutions, and all the needed help with problems we're dealing with using ETH, I'd like to know a little bit more about it from your personal experience.  


Are you satisfied with the Merge after some time has passed? What did you expect, and did it meet your expectations? How do you deal with all of the other ETH issues that every holder/trader faces?  


I should mention that the Metis platform has a variety of use cases, including assisting users in developing their own NFT minting, yield farming, which I've been using as well, and DEX, which is fantastic, so there are some reasons why this platform appears trustworthy to me.

Ethereum has become deflationary for the first time since the merge!,"54 days ago Ethereum successfully underwent 'The Merge', moving to Proof of Stake and changing its supply dynamics drastically. 

This, coupled with the introduction of EIP1559 where transaction fees are burnt, means a deflationary ETH became a possibility. Fast forward to today, and ETH issuance has officially become deflationary for the first time since the merge. I.e, more ETH has been burnt than issued since that date.

The brilliant website [https://ultrasound.money/](https://ultrasound.money/) has been tracking this.

Ethereum's Layer 2 ecosystem is undeniably growing,"Ethereum is notorious for being prohibitively slow and costly. At the height of cryptocurrency's most recent hype cycle, something as simple as exchanging one token for another on the blockchain could have cost upwards of $40.  


It's no surprise that L2 protocols have grown in popularity, so there are layer 2 rollups for those who want to keep their transactions within the Ethereum ecosystem, and there's a reason why Metis and other L2 solutions have become so popular.  


Layer 2 rollups have special systems in place to ensure that transactions aren't spoofed or altered before being sent back to Ethereum's main chain, which is pretty cool.  


In what L2 protocol do you believe the most, and what fascinates you about it?  


Did you know that the total value locked in Ethereum's Layer 2 networks has surpassed $5 billion? Ethereum's Layer 2 ecosystem is undeniably growing.  


Although the Ethereum Merge was the second-most anticipated blockchain update this year, Ethereum supporters have long hoped that Layer 2 growth will help the ecosystem achieve mass adoption by lowering costs and making the network more accessible. While Ethereum mainnet continues to hold the majority of the crypto ecosystem's capital, with just under $32 billion locked up, Layer 2 appears to be catching up quickly.",47.0,2022-11-05 11:32:25,0.86
L2 Airdrops should include validators,"I’ve been advocating for airdrops to solo-stakers for a while, not only are validators important ecosystem participants.

for L2s that inherit their security from ETH it makes so much sense

all these L2s wish to have a decentralized node set, some will have token utility baked into the ‘validating’ nodes  

so including actors likely to support these operations makes sense

Sharding on paper looks great but it’s not a panacea if we all want to solve the trilemma with a perfect blockchain,"When blockchain is used by a lot of people, its scaling capabilities are being tested greatly. As for users I see it in blockchain speed and the transaction prices. And it's a problem not only for me I guess, we all do not want to waste our time and money when using an app to transfer tokens, send messages etc and we want to be secure. Ethereum 2.0 increased its scalability and reduced fees but still…we all know it is not perfect. It promises sharding upgrades (in 2023) that will spread the data storage requirements across the entire network, no longer requiring every node to hold 100% of the data. But I personally really doubt if sharding actually helps to solve this scalability, security and decentralization issue.

So sharding breaks the blockchain down into smaller components that can be processed in parallel, rather than sequentially. In fact, Ethereum sharding is somehow in the proposal stage, they made another step towards sharding after the merge but it’s just a step. It cannot guarantee data availability. As far as I know, other blockchains like Polkadot, Everscale, Near, Zilliqa use sharding now. All this sounds great on paper. Okay, these blockchain introduce higher scalability than Ethereum (Polkadot 1k TPS, Near 4k TPS, Everscale 64k TPS). But I’m sure as it greatly increases the scalability and transaction speed of blockchains it can further compromise decentralization and security which is essential for crypto. And have these blockchains even introduced true sharding? I doubt it.

I studied it and as far as I know the issue with scalability and decentralization happens due to the distributed nature of blockchain networks that require continuous communication among all participants. If all this is solved then we’ll get the perfect blockchain both for users and developers and finally be all safe, not controlled by anyone enjoying fast and cheap transactions. Do any of these blockchains have solutions in place to seamlessly get this traffic to move between shards? Or are all of the existing leading blockchains just the intermediate stages on the way to solve the trilemma and introduce a real sharding solution?",37.0,2022-11-03 09:07:55,0.93
The reason gas prices have been declining for the past 4 quarters despite having over 100% gas usage,"####**The Enigma**

One interesting curiosity I've noticed is that **Ethereum gas prices have been falling 20-40% each quarter since EIP-1559 initiated DESPITE gas usage being over the 100% 15M target gas usage.**

This is surprising because normally under EIP-1559, if each block stays exactly at the 100% gas target, gas price will also stay exactly the same.

|**Date**|**Block Time**|**Blocks**|**Gas % used**|**Gas Price (Gwei)**|**Notes**|

|2022 Oct|12|7157|102%|23|Post-Merge|

####**So why is this happening?**

This counter-intuitive phenomenon can be explained by simple math. After EIP-1559, gas price changes whenever the previous block's gas usage deviates from 15M gas. It increases by 12.5% at 30M gas, and decreases by 12.5% at 0M gas. Any value between the 2 limits affects price proportionally up to 12.5%.

**So what happens if a 30M-gas block were followed by a 0M-gas block?**

    (x+a) * (x-a) = x^2 - a^2
    (1 + 0.125) * (1 - 0.125) = 98.4% => 2.6% price decrease

Thus if a 30M-gas block were followed by a 0M-gas block, the gas price would still fall 2.6% even though the average gas usage stays at 15M gas. The larger the volatility from the 15M-gas target, the larger the negative price pressure.

**In fact, in an extreme theoretical case where there were one full day of 30M-gas blocks followed by another full day of 0M-gas blocks, the gas price on the 3rd day would be 10^50 times smaller despite that the average usage between the 2 days was still 15M gas**. Obviously, validators will not magically be able to process transactions 10^50 times cheaper, so this is completely theoretical.

**Nevertheless, the effect is there, and we have been experiencing a 20-40% decrease in gas prices quarterly since EIP-1559 was introduced in Aug 2021. Though the decrease has slowed down since The Merge.**

A mix of these 2 cases will continue happening until a dynamic market equilibrium is reached:

1. Gas price keeps falling every quarter
1. Daily gas usage rises noticeably above its current 102% average. (Edit: I did some simulations afterwards. Gas usage actually remains around 102-103% of 15M when the price remains stable. So it's actually not as noticeable as I thought.)

------------------------

**Edit**: I thought about it more, and it does seem to either be a bug or a purposeful design flaw.

Let's say you have 3 fee changes of a, b, and c where the sum of all 3 is zero. You have to find a fee formula f(x) where the product, f(a) * f(b) * f(c) = 1.

So I figured out the correct formula is to use any exponential function. For example:

    a + b = -c
    e^a * e^b * e^c = e^a * e^b * e^(-a-b) = 1

I was going to report it, but looks like **someone else** already mentioned it a long time ago: https://ethresear.ch/t/make-eip-1559-more-like-an-amm-curve/9082/2

Guess they never bothered fixing it.

"Four months ago, I calculated the yearly rate of inflation for a number of cryptos. I have now updated the numbers to include the most recent minting. Is your project's rate still meeting the claimed rate?","I tried unsuccessfully to find a good resource that regularly updates/calculates the current inflation rates for cryptocurrencies. So now I do it for myself.

**What is inflation of a crypto?**

I am invested into a small number of projects, but one key factor I focus heavily on is the inflationary nature of the native token or coin for a project. At its core basis is the idea of supply and demand.  Simply put, if supply outstrips demand, then the price of the crypto will drop.

**The Inflation of a coin is simply the rate at which it is currently increasing its supply every year. I.e. If a token has a 2% inflation rate, then one year from now, 2% more tokens are available to buy.**

The circulating supply of a token can drop for a number of reasons such as a burning or lost keys. Supply can increase for minting, rewards, staking or token unlocks.

Inflation can be a good thing for some projects in early stages, but overall a low rate of inflation will keep the buying pressure high. For example, Bitcoin's inflation rate in 2012 was 32% and halved the following year. So if the project is under a year old, you can cut it some slack for now. But if it's still hitting double figure inflation after three years, it is not in good shape.

&#x200B;

**Max Supply:**

It is worth noting that some projects have a maximum number of tokens that can ever be put into circulation, whereas some projects have an infinite supply, meaning the number of tokens can increase forever. For example, Bitcoin can never exceed 21million coins.

&#x200B;

**Ethereum Merge:**

An important milestone occurred last month when Ethereum finally moved from proof-of-work to proof-of-stake. This is expected to lower the level of inflation over time for ETH.

&#x200B;

**Calculations:**

I have taken the numbers from coinmarketcap at [31 Oct 2021](https://coinmarketcap.com/historical/20211031/) and 31 Oct 2022 (today). Anyone can verify these if they wish.  I've calculated inflation simply as:

Inflation Rate % = (2022 Supply / 2021 Supply ) - 1

&#x200B;

Some projects publish their expected inflation rate. For example, Bitcoin's estimated inflation rate for the year was 1.77% - which was absolutely perfect.

I will reserve judgement for now as to which projects show more or less potential for value increase based on supply and demand only. How does your project choice measure up? What is the advertised rate according the white paper tokenomics? How close is it to the actual numbers?

If you are concerned about your investments, check the numbers against several other sources. CoinGecko would be another good place to start.

&#x200B;

Also, if somebody can please give me a reliable circulating supply for Moons one year ago, I will add them to the table. The current circulating supply is already available at 104,2725,031.

[The last 4 months since the dip to $17.7K.](https://preview.redd.it/twwua5rcfeu91.jpg?width=1774&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=95664bb9c84eba2598431d8de837136eee422e0b)

# What happened in 2018?

After finally breaking below $6K, Bitcoin hit its lowest point in that market cycle at $3.2k. Then crabbed for over 3 months.

&#x200B;

[The 2018\/19 market bottom and breakout \(not visually on the same scale as the previous chart\)](https://preview.redd.it/x6k00i6pfeu91.jpg?width=1765&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=3fe015336cbd0f704b156e8de4cf7b03aaacc5c9)

It took 3 months and 18 days of crabbing before any significant reversal (the very first big green candle).

After 4 months and 27 days, the market had a full breakout, back above $6K (which would be the equivalent of returning above $30K in the current market) and ended its downward trend, had a sustained uptrend, thus ending the bear market.

Keep in mind, no two market cycles has ever been exactly the same. But trader behavior, and supply and demand, do have similar general patterns.

# What type of bad news still failed to bring Bitcoin lower, in the last 4 months?

&#x200B;

1- Escalation of nuclear war threat in the war in Ukraine.

2- Worldwide recession going deeper.

3- Stock markets continuing to drop deeper into bear territory, with many tech stocks crashing hard.

4- High inflation worldwide, and higher CPI than expected last week.

5- China's economy imploding.

6- Energy crisis in Europe.

7- Rumors of looming Mt Gox payments of around 140,000 BTC (many people thought it would drop after August).

8- Fed ramping up their rate hike.

9- Gold dropping to an 18 months low.

10- DXY hitting a 20 year high.

11- The big Ethereum merge, creating uncertainty.

12- Monkey pox outbreak.

13- Threats of war between China and Taiwan during another escalation in the Sino-Taiwanese crisis.

14- Binance BNB smart chain hack.

&#x200B;

None of that was able to bring the price lower.

What more would it take then?

# How has the price managed to hold up, here's my theory:

In short, supply and demand.

I think most of the people who would panic sell have panic sold during the Luna crash, and when Bitcoin crashed.

This took out an enormous chunk of the selling pressure.

We've had bad news since January (not to mention Covid, Brexit, killer wasps, etc from the previous year).

Traders may be getting bear fatigue and jaded by the same old bad news. And doomsday panic has already been in big part priced in.

I also think that the long term 4 year cycles are still a prevailing force in this market.

There's also been a lot of good news within the market in terms of adoption and tech development.

Just in the last 2 weeks, we had news of adoption from Google, Samsung, MasterCard, Societe General, etc...

The Ethereum Merge Was 1 Month Ago. What’s Happened Since?,"# Power consumption and CO2 emissions

The forecast for TW reduction was wrong. The end result was even better!

According to [this post](https://blog.ethereum.org/2021/05/18/country-power-no-more) that the Ethereum Foundation strongly endorsed, the power consumption of each transaction was supposed to be 0.04 kWh. Instead, each transaction uses about 0.03 kWh, a 25% reduction over the original calculation!

CO2 emissions have also heavily dropped. PoW Ethereum released about 11 million tons of CO2, while PoS Ethereum emits around 870 tons. This is a reduction of 99.992%.

# Inflation/deflation

For the first time, Ethereum became deflationary at the Merge. This only lasted a short time, burning about 200 ETH, but it became deflationary again as of last week! The network got busier due to a free mint token called XEN Crypto. And while that was a giant pump and dump, it did contribute to Ethereum becoming deflationary for almost 9 days, reducing PoS issuance from +13,000 ETH to +6,700 ETH since the Merge.

# Censorship

Censorship has been a hot topic in the Ethereum and wider crypto community lately, as an OFAC-regulated MEV-relay built (and censored) more than 51% of total blocks.

They claim to have remedied this issue by making Flashbots open-source, which allows developers to fork Flashbots without the OFAC list.

# Slashings

[Since the Merge](https://beaconcha.in/validators/slashings), there have been 25 slashings. These were due to 'attestation violations', which means they would run two identical validator keys on two different nodes, leading to the network thinking they are attacking.

This action could be malicious because if they double-sign enough attestations saying “yes, this block is valid” they could be trying to attack Ethereum, which the network obviously doesn't like.

# Conclusion:

Ethereum has only had a few bumps since the Merge, mostly related to MEV relays. Flashbots is the main culprit here, censoring almost 42% of all blocks on Ethereum since the Merge.

But overall, Co2E is down, power consumption is down, and Ethereum had a week-long deflationary streak (something that wouldn’t be possible under PoW!).",97.0,2022-10-16 06:34:21,0.78
ETH vs BTC issuance since the merge.,"The Merge occurred one month ago when Ethereum turned off and obsoleted PoW forever.

Since then:

Bitcoin issued 27355 $BTC ($523m)

Ethereum issued 6798 $ETH ($9m)

And its only been a month. Just one freaking month.

In the last 24hrs 51% of ETH blocks were censored and OFAC compliant.,"In the last 24hrs approx 51% of the blocks added to the Ethereum blockchain were built by MEV relays that are regulated and censoring transactions as per OFAC regulations. This means that they will not relay transactions from tornado cash etc for inclusion in the blocks validators validate.

[https:\/\/www.mevwatch.info\/](https://preview.redd.it/f1dzn4cq8tt91.png?width=959&format=png&auto=webp&s=3e84dfa2c2c0162eb7386621cbf6a8f250cd3833)

**As of the last 100 blocks 56% were censored.**

There are currently seven major  mev-boost relays including Flashbots, BloXroute Max Profit, BloXroute  Ethical, BloXroute Regulated, BlockNative, Manifold and Eden. Of the 7  available major relays only 3 do not censor according to OFAC compliance  requirements. **OFAC compliant relays will not include any transactions  that interact with the Tornado Cash smart contract or other sanctioned  wallet addresses as designated by OFAC.**

Not all blocks built by OFAC compliant relays are censoring, however, all blocks built by OFAC  compliant relays will censor when non-compliant transactions are  broadcast to the network.

*How is this determined:*

OFAC compliancy list for MEV relays is here: [https://github.com/remyroy/ethstaker/blob/main/MEV-relay-list.md](https://github.com/remyroy/ethstaker/blob/main/MEV-relay-list.md)

*Why do* *~~Miners~~* *Validators use MEV boost relays?*

Simply put, profit. Validators use MEV boost relays to ""build"" blocks that include a more profitable grouping of transactions as to maximise fee profit from the block.

Before the merge we were told no protocol level OFAC compliance would occur and any attempt to do so would end with validators being slashed.

[https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin/status/1559271315080679432](https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin/status/1559271315080679432)

Vitalik himself said he would vote for: X

>X) Consider the censorship an attack on Ethereum and burn their stake via social consensus  
>  
>Y) Tolerate the censorship

We're over 50% compliance now and validators seem happy to continue using Flashbots and other MEV relay services, as they're more profitable, despite knowing full well they are OFAC compliant and will not relay Tornado cash and other transactions.

This seems like OFAC compliance with extra steps. The validators themselves might not be doing it at a protocol level but they're actively using a secondary service to choose which transactions go into the blocks they validate.

The Cost of Running The Ethereum Network Post Merge,"Before the merge, the indirect cost to run the Ethereum network was 14,600 ETH per day.

At current prices was $18,848,454 USD per day.

At All time high it was $71,418,820 USD per day.

I say indirect as you don't directly pay that cost to maintain the network, but it does devalue your ETH earnings by increasing the supply and diluting market cap, acting the same as inflation.

Post merge, network costs are around 1,600 ETH per day.

At current prices that's $2,064,032 USD per day. Approximately $16.5 million dollars less PER DAY!

At All time high it was $7,826,720 USD per day. Even at ATH prices, it still costs less to run the network than pre-merge at these lower prices.

As well, the supply of ETH has basically been unchanged since Sept 23 at 120.53 Million coins vs a YTD growth of 2.44% previously.

The market might be a little shaky right now, but I imagine these benefits from the merge will start showing themselves soon. They should also keep ETH from dipping too low during this bear market by giving it a stronger foundation then it had pre-merge. 

Things are looking good for ETH!",41.0,2022-10-11 17:51:55,0.88
Ethereum supply reverted back to September levels,"Ethereum supply it's currently at its lowest level since September 29th, making it the longest deflationary period until now.

https://preview.redd.it/8egskl8cv5t91.png?width=720&format=png&auto=webp&s=2bfc9e95a604dd0f782add63fc21a9af5f41c2a1

This was possible thanks to the merge, which already prevented the issuance of more than 310K ETH ($400M).

Currently, Ethereum is deflationary as long as the average gas price is above 15 gwei. This means supply will decrease faster during a bull market, where network usage is higher, and so are gas prices. 

The decrease in supply we are seeing was due to Xen crypto, which is currently leading the leaderboard of ETH burns.

Eth has been deflationary for over 2 days now!!,"This feels like a big deal to me, but nobodys talking about it. there hasn't been a sustained period of deflation of more than a few hours since the merge, but it's been like this for two days now. Source: www.ultrasound.money

Maybe it's the 30% rise of people joining Ethereum this quarter in spite of it being a crypto winter. I wander whether this influx of new people is what's propping up the crypto economy from dipping as far as previous bear markets?
Everything about this makes me super bullish. Currently it's average is 0.12% inflation (That's 25x less inflationary then before the merge: 3.75%), but if this trend continues it could even surpass -0.5% and trend towards deflation as an asset.

This is at a time in a bear market when statistically usage is considerably lower. So it goes to show that next bull it's going to become highly deflationary, and in a situation when we get the inevitable supply shock; where supply is struggling to meet demand and the price is rising, deflation will rise and it will fan the flames. People were calling this a triple halving but it's actually closer to a quintuple than a triple, 

If this holds true and ETH continues to be deflationary, then it could be something unlike anything we've ever seen. I say this because it would beat bitcoins claim of being a 'store of value' or 'digital gold'. Ethereum being ultrasound money is money that is not only a store of value, but fundamentally appreciatory in its core nature.

A counter arguement that worries me (and vitalook said himself) is that people are struggling to find the use case for crypto, but I see one when the currency is deflationary, but you can still get also get up to 8% interest on certain platforms. The use case for me is as a serious investment tool,

I just wish that the supply shock would hold off until the end of this recession because I think that would trigger the mother of all bullruns. And if we can sustain the deflationary aspect of Eth we might even see some form of the mythic supercycle. I hope that's not too bold to say, I know it's very unlikely and maybe not even possible.

Thanks for joining me on my ramblings, I've been thinking a lot about the state and future of Ethereum recently and I needed to let it out. I hope I'm not telling everybody information they already know.

Anyway, when/if the gas fees go down I'll be buying more. 🔥🔥🔥",128.0,2022-10-10 10:12:58,0.76
Here's my ultimate hopium list - 30 reasons to be bullish!,"
Two weeks ago a friend of mine asked why I'm so bullish on reddit NFTs. I came up with a bunch of reasons and several members of this sub requested I translate them into English and post them so today I finally found some free time to get down to it. 


Disclaimer: I'm open to criticism and I'm very curious what you think. I'm new to NFT trading, but I've been trading crypto on and off since 2017 and now I'm working professionally as a market maker. I'm no expert by any means. Some of these might be redundant, I'll try to update it the list with what happened during the past two weeks. English is not my first language, so excuse my phrasing which might be weird at times. Let's dive right into it:

1. Reddit has airdropped free NFTs to millions of users at this point. They're managed to grab the interested not only of the people who claimed them, but also strangers who see their avatars and wonder what the fuss is about. It's safe to say that every active subreddit has been 'infected' at this point. Giving a free fix is a great marketing strategy, as we don't initially realise we're being marketed. Especially when they learn that free avatars can be sold anytime and there's liquidity for that. 


2. The fact that NFTs are being airdropped gradually makes people impatient about getting their own, which in turn creates anticipation or even FOMO, especially in crypto communities. Some people will grow impatient and go out to buy the paid ones


3. The fact that every n-th active redditor owns an (free or paid) NFT now makes it harder to ostracise their owners. It's easier to hate on the minority, and vice versa, harder to exclude members of your own community simply because of their avatars (there is certain tribalism to reddit communities, especially in smaller, radical, political or activitist subreddits). Unfortunately redditors are still being discriminated but it's becoming harder and more and more people stand up against such exclusion, which in my personal opinion is fucking outrageous and should not be tolerared. 


4. Exposure effect. The more users with NFTs you see, the more likely you'll be to develop a liking to them, or at least stop disliking them. 


5. Association bias. When you see a post or comment you totally agree with, and the autor owns an NFT, you'll be more likely to like them too, over time. This unfortunately also works in the other direction, but I'm assuming most people spend the majority of time on subreddits where they enjoy the content. You might think I'm reaching here, but psychological biases or *heuristics* are some really powerful tools that marketers are well aware of and take advantage of in everyday life. So go ahead and create awesome content anywhere on reddit! 


6. Contrast effect - the enhancement of perception of an object as a result of simultaneous or subsequent (within short timeframe) exposure to it. Just like an average-looking person will look more attractive among their unattractive peers, reddit NFTs stand out from basic avatars, especially the default uncustomised ones, which makes them look fancier than they would look in isolation. This happens all the time in the comments.


7. Sunk cost fallacy - I wouldn't expect the price of reddit avatars on Opensea to fall below store price anyway, but the fact that redditors pay a fixed amount to own it makes them less likely to get rid of it at a lower price. It's an additional safety net which most likely won't be needed as yet we haven't seen many whales hoarding avatars at store prices (those would be more willing to take the loss than your average redditor who owns one copy and actively wears the avatar). It also applies in time being spent on reddit - NFT owners will be less likely to limit their time spent using this site or delete their account after going through the trouble of selling (might not be applicable if reddit introduces their own marketplace), so watch out if you end up wasting your time here due to your cool avatar :D


8. Endowment effect - there's an assymetry in  people's willing to buy an object and their willingness to get rid of it.

> In a valuation paradigm, people's maximum willingness to pay (WTP) to acquire an object is typically lower than the least amount they are willing to accept (WTA) to give up that same object when they own it—even when there is no cause for attachment, or even if the item was only obtained minutes ago

People who own an object tend to value it higher than those who don't. It encourages holding, and you might ask why it applies to NFTs and not to other crypto. Reddit NFTs are usable objects, even if digital, which is not the case with cryptos or other financial assets, which, first of all are divisible (you can sell a part of your profit and keep the rest) and second, often treated merely as investments which aren't being used on a daily basis. 


9. Recognisability. Once you've been using your own, unique avatar for a while you're being recognised in your communities for easily, you're basically building a brand, just like social media influencers are building their own brand. NFT ownership facilitates this phenomenon, which is well visible in this sub, where we often recognise each other not by nicknames, but by avatars. Or both. This might lead new people to create their own distinct avatar, but also keep them from selling it, fearing that they will end up losing their brand. Which leads me to my next point which is:


10. Customisation. There are billions of different traits you can mix into a single avatar, which will make your avatar unique and help you stand out in the comments


11. Other than that, mix and matching is insanely fun and addictive! You can get really creative with your own and seeing others come up with unique ideas will draw more people to participate. You'll either find the one you like most and stick to it (and grow attachment) or become hooked on switching your avatars every second day. Either way it's a win win. 


12. Attachment issues is another thing which works along with endowment effect but is somewhat different. Once you hit your perfect combo, you'll want to keep all the traits that it contains


13. On the other hand, people who are into mix and matching might buy certain avatars which don't seem that appealing on their own, but possess certain traits that they would want to own as well (e. g. bubble tea, no offence)


14. Should have mentioned it somewhere earlier, but both being able to wear your NFT and mix and match them is truly disruptive in an NFT world. This is a huge advancement. 


15. No more screenshoting. Reddit made it impossible for anyone to fake the blue hexagon (and integrated blockchain link) so you won't have to worry that somebody will copy your avatar since it can easily be checked if it's real or fake. Those who go out to fake avatars might think they're witty by doing so, but it seems like they're just making fools of themselves. 


16. Ethereum merge. Even though these NFTs aren't minted on Ethereum mainnet, your average normie wouldn't dive too deep into details about which chain it's been minted on. The fact that the carbon footprint is so neglibile at this point makes a better impression of NFTs as a whole and it's easier to disprove incredibly simplified and basically false points about NFTs being bad for the environment which have been going around for the past year or more. 


17. Availability to buy for non-crypto users. It's never been so easy to buy an NFT, now you can do it in seconds, with a credit card, using Apple Pay/Google Play from your mobile or desktop. 


18. Scarcity. So far we've seen tens of thousands of paid avatars minted, with 430 (I believe) active reddit users per month. This amount to 1 first gen nft per 10k users. 


19. And this is assuming that each of us owns only one NFT. On average, I believe the number would be higher than 2 or even more, but I have no numbers to back it up. 


20. NFTs seem to be bigger on Twitter/discord communities than reddit and the news has only recently reached it. Whales have only recently started paying attention to it. And there is a lot of room to grow on reddit, especially since it's crypto community is pretty big (5mil subscribers on r/cc if I recall correctly), which is still growing very fast even during the bear market 


21. The growth of this subreddit itself. The number of subscribers has doubled during the past 30 days alone and it's still a very tiny community, which indicates a lot of room to grow. Moreover, it's incredibly active compared to other subreddits (https://subredditstats.com/r/avatartrading). Despite that, it's very welcoming, wholesome, has an active discord and mods which put in tons of good work. 


22. Reddit is the 18th biggest site on the internet. Even if it was a side project, I think they treat it very seriously, and what makes me believe so was the well thought-out plan of distribution of free avatars, implementation of mixing features and incredible choice of various artists. 


23. Speaking of artists, the fact that many of NFTs are incredible pieces of art will help many talented artists gain more fraction. The 2.5% royalties also make people feel better about spending their money on it. It will also draw new, possibly not well-known (but maybe also popular) artists to apply for the next gens. 


24. Gen I collectibles are usually more highly priced than future gens simply due to the fact that they were the first to start the movement. 


25. Next gens will most likely have more mints due to the interest in Gen I. This will make the first gen avatars relatively more scarce even though there will be more avatars in total. So while the market cap might not keep growing exponentially, it will likely be future gens that are less profitable. 


26. Reddit has no reason to discontinue its NFT project, as it generates a lot of revenue to them, so we can almost count that risk out. 


27. Each artists distribute a collection of 3 avatars (at least so far), which on one hand, allows people to grab one regardless of their budget, since some are more affordable, and on the other hand makes collectors more likely to get all three if they like one of them, since the theme is similar. 


28. A sense of belonging to the group, we can see it happening with cone heads or poop heads. It's good for the community since it encourages wholesome behaviour and cooperation to gain new members and promote the community. It also creates a certain prestige in extreme cases (see BAYC - I'm not comparing them to reddit avatars, but a similar mechanism is visible to a lesser degree) 


29. The power of the meme. Cones and poops are the most prominent examples so far, but we'll likely see more of them in the future gens. Once the meme catches on, the price can go parabolic, we've seen that in the shitcoin space, but also with shares (GME etc) 


30. And finally, we're in the bear market, especially when it comes to NFTs, where the volume on Opensea has dropped 99% (if I recall correctly) from it's ATH and reddit avatars are doing incredibly well nonetheless. One can only speculate what will happen once we survive the bear market. Of course there's a small chance NFTs will never recover to their prime popularity, but seeing how new functionality is being added I think they're bound to bounce back as a whole market or at least do well in its niche, but they are far from being dead. 


Let me know if you enjoyed the read :D feel free to add more, to dispute some (or all) of these, and I hope this inspires someones to write counterpoints about how we should be bearish instead. Thank you if you got that far < 3

Edit: Thank y'all for the awards and kind words <3 love this community. I wasn't sure how this post would be received but it feels flattering and encourages me to post more in the future.",76.0,2022-10-08 17:08:12,0.94
Pretty impressive how the ETH supply has been affected by the Merge: POS vs. POW -95.54% reduction in issuance so far ‼️,"Under POW around 253,000 (vs. 11,300 in POS) ETH would
have been issued and rewarded to miners. 

This mean a lot of things:

- Less selling pressure on the markets (miners need to partially sell their tokens to finance their operations)
- Better security against 51% attacks
- Easier way to even better decentralization and holders paying much less for security (BTC holders paid $37.25 / transaction, ETH holders earned $0.78 / transaction)

Once the gas demand increases, Ethereum will even turn deflationary!",388.0,2022-10-06 22:49:28,0.88

September included [Nexus Mutual](https://blog.matter-labs.io/peace-of-mind-with-nexus-mutual-250365d0cf9e), [HashFlow](https://blog.matter-labs.io/accessible-defi-with-hashflow-32e28f22f443), and [Ramp](https://blog.matter-labs.io/breaking-down-crypto-barriers-93a90b70a283).

# Community

We were present at Mainnet by Messari, and SmartCon 2022. It was amazing to meet the community in person and to connect with the Chainlink community. We talked about Layer 3, had a developer workshop, and hosted social events. You can find the links to the streams below.

**Discord Changes**

We incorporated the brand new Discord Forums feature in our server to experiment with how we can improve the community experience. We always appreciate feedback on what we do so let us know how you like the forums feature! Here are a few of the changes made with more to come:

1. \#💡- suggestion forum replaces the #suggestions

"Understanding missed attestations, understanding low effectiveness and improving your setup","There are 2 kind of causes for missing an attestation or having a *somewhat* low effectiveness with your validator. There are causes that are under your control as a staker and there are causes that are outside of your control. Even with a perfect setup, you might miss some attestations or incorrectly vote during an attestation lowering your effectiveness once in a while. Causes that are outside of your control are often related to network propagation or related to some of your peers being late in performing their own duties.

To go on a deep dive and learn everything about the attestation duty, timings, effectiveness and network propagation, check out these great articles.

- [Understanding Attestation Misses](https://www.symphonious.net/2022/09/25/understanding-attestation-misses/) by Adrian Sutton
- [Exploring ETH2: Attestation Inclusion](https://www.symphonious.net/2020/09/08/exploring-eth2-attestation-inclusion/) by Adrian Sutton
- [Defining Attestation Effectiveness](https://www.attestant.io/posts/defining-attestation-effectiveness/) by Jim McDonald

As a staker, you cannot do much about the causes that are outside of your control. What you can do is work on elements of your setup that are under your control to maximize your rewards. Even if you have a setup that was performing well before the merge, it's possible that with the additional work being introduced, some overlooked part of your setup might be the cause of additional misses or lower effectiveness since the merge happened. That's why you should double check all these items.

1. Make sure your clients are **up-to-date**. Client updates often include optimizations and improvements that will help perform your duties on time.
2. Make sure your machine consistently has enough **resources** (CPU, RAM, disk, etc). Using a dedicated machine can help. If your clients are starved of any of these resources, it will likely be a cause for more misses and lower effectiveness.
3. Make sure your **time** is properly in sync. The beacon chain protocol is quite time sensitive. chrony is a good tool to improve your time sync. On Ubuntu or Debian derivatives, installing chrony is often as easy as `sudo apt install chrony`. On Windows, you can use [these instructions](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethstaker/comments/nfca22/an_opiniated_solution_to_improve_time_sync_on/) to improve your time sync.
4. Make sure you have good **Internet** latency, bandwidth and quality. For home validators, it's unrealistic to ask for a dedicated ISP or Internet connection for your validator, but make sure your other network uses don't interfere too much with your validator. In case of doubt, see if you can get a better plan from your provider or check if there is an alternative provider in your area that can improve your Internet.
5. Make sure you consistently have enough **peers**. Monitoring your clients peers count is not a bad idea if you have the technical ability.
6. Make sure you have properly configured **open ports** that permit incoming connections. Not only can this improve your setup networking health and your peers count, but it will also improve the Ethereum network health as a whole. To test if your ports are opened, you can use the StakeHouse open ports checker. Calling `curl https://eth2-client-port-checker.vercel.app/api/checker?ports=30303,9000` should return a result that includes 30303 and 9000 in the `open_ports` field if those ports are opened from the Internet. 30303 is the default P2P port for Geth and 9000 is the default P2P port for many consensus clients. Adjust these values if you use custom ports or if you use clients which have different default ports. Consult your client documentation to find more about this.

Once you have those in place, there is little more you can do to help. There might be some marginal benefits in connecting with more peers at the cost of higher resources usage, especially bandwidth. Under normal circumstances, the default peers count from your clients should be good. Monitoring Internet quality with tools like those from [pingman](https://pingman.com/) can help pinpoint the cause of some of these missed attestations if they are network related, but it will likely still be out of your control.",73.0,2022-10-02 12:49:28,0.97
I DCA into the Reddit Index: These are the Top 7 Crypto Subreddits - Month 2,"This is the 2nd month where I invested $20 into each of the top 7 crypto subreddits again. As a reference I also dca into the top 7 tech cryptos according to [quantintegral.com](https://www.quantintegral.com). The results for the second month are as follows:

||Input (2 months)|Current Value (22-10-01)|Cryptocurrencies|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Reddit Index|$280|$283.2 (+1.1%)|BTC, ETH, DOGE, ADA, SHIB, LTC, XRP|
|Crypto Tech Index|$280|$272.7 (-2.6%)|ETH, BNB, DOT, ADA, AVAX, MATIC, IOTA|

&#x200B;

I also obtained data for the subreddit stats:

|\# for September 2022|Subscribers|Minimum monthly active user volume|
|:-|:-|:-|
|1. Bitcoin|4,596,431|430,929|
|2. DOGE|2,334,610|227,818|
|3. Ethereum|1,475,273|200,977|
|4. Cardano|697,929|120,550|
|5. Shiba-Inu|474,792|94,944|
|6. LTC|357,229|36,967|
|7. XRP|352,771|26,022|
|8. Monero (for info)|270,327|85,989|

*Minimum monthly active user volume:  Estimated number of monthly active users by monitoring daily active users at different time zones.*

I was surprised that the reddit index has held up quite well during these volatile times. When compared to the tech index, it actually outperformed it last month. Last month, there was a big event: The merger. Everyone had high hopes, but it was a case of buy the rumors, sell the news. The crypto market tanked during the Merge. One of the few cryptos holding strong was actually XRP. It saved the the reddit index and is also one of the main reason why the reddit portfolio is slightly in positive. It should be taken with a grain of salt that reddit 'outperformed' the crypto tech index and also the global crypto market (which consists of 46% BTC, 20% ETH and 34% Altcoins) due to few data points. I am still looking for how this experiment develops and unfolds.

Buying shitcoins still hurts, but I'm less concerned than I was last month. As a side note, by investing in so many coins, I became uninterested about the price of a single cryptocurrency. There would be so many prices to compare that I am unmotivated to look it up. By investing in the top 7 reddit/tech cryptos, I feel less emotional and it definitely relieves my psychological stress during the bear market.

"PoW vs PoS $225,907,500 Savings So Far","Hello Redditors,

I was reviewing the status of Ethereum today after the merge, it's been 14 days and wanted to see how we are doing.

I was using [https://ultrasound.money/](https://ultrasound.money/) to check on the supply of Ethereum and compare supply before and after merge.

If we were still on PoW we would have produced 180,329 Ethereum. Since we moved to PoS we have produced 8,554 Ethereum instead.

Doing some math using today's prices, say $1300 per Ethereum.

180,329 \* 1300 = $237,027,700 (PoW production of Ethereum)

8,554     \* 1300 = $11,120,200   (PoS   production of Ethereum)

11,120,200  - 237,027,700 = - $225,907,500.

What this tells me is that since the merge, Ethereum would have normally produced an additional $225,907,500 to it's market cap, which is usually collected by miners and maybe sold on exchanges. That's only in 14 days.

This is massive with the current state of things.

I believe the next bull run is going to be massive when the supply actually starts going negative combined with stackers trying to stake more to get higher rewards, just like what we saw with miners fighting over GPUs pushing the price of GPUs to the moon, stackers will be fighting over Ethereum coins.

What are your thoughts? Did I make any mistakes or overlook something?

Nothing posted here is financial advice. This is only for entertainment purposes.

EDIT: This thread is not discussing if PoS is better than PoW. This thread is strictly discussing the supply shock by switching from PoW to PoS.",346.0,2022-09-29 18:54:37,0.87

"I was almost phished out of my ETH—Your wallet doesn't need any ""upgrade"" post-Merge","I got an email today telling me ""Your wallet hаs failed the Merge!"" from ""Metamask"" and like an idiot I clicked on the link and started entering my secret key to my MetaMask wallet to ""upgrade"" my wallet. I was midway through doing that when I had the common sense to check the URL, which was mergesmeta\[dot\]com. Then I checked the email sender and it was ""info@hiringacademy.com.""

Needless to say it was a scam email. None of the links work on this webpage. Just sending a reminder for more users who are not following every news or having every bit of technical information.

Thoughts on ETH Merge and Blockchain Development?,"The long anticipated Ethereum merge has finally completed without hiccups. The move from PoW to PoS would foster more adoption and security, wouldn't it? And that brings me to the question – how far are we on blockchain development generally?


Ethereum is where most users and developers go first. But the good thing about adoption is that new chains are coming up and also committed to building something good. Geeq is one of those blockchains. I've been following them since the beginning of the year. They are attempting to build something different using their multichain architecture.


First, Geeq Data is there and focusing on helping businesses and organisations with efficiency and flexibility of their blockchain data. The real life utility here caught my attention. Second, they have 99% in BFT, which means more security. Devs will have the opportunity to run nodes and build their own chain and dApps on their ecosystem. Lastly, there's interoperability and scalability between chains. They complement each other and improve user experience.


The developments on this is the right step towards adoption, wouldn't you agree? I think it's fair to say that this one, amongst others, is setting the pace for new standards. Only time will tell.",20.0,2022-09-27 11:35:12,1.0
"Staked ETH Accounts For 12% of Total Supply, Inflation Down >90%","I am really surprised there haven't been more reporting on this. I saw an article about ethereum inflation and decided to dig into it.

At the time of writing per ethereum.org, the total ETH staked is 14,706,107.ETH. [YCharts has the total supply](https://ycharts.com/indicators/ethereum_supply) at 13.53M. This means that the total staked ETH accounts for 12% of the total ETH supply. Further, the amount of validators amount to 434, 777. And the total unique wallet address [per etherscan](https://etherscan.io/chart/address) stands at 206,041,618. This means that 0.21% of wallets hold 12% of the supply. Rewards are approximately 4% APY.

Also, with 12% of the supply removed from distribution, [issuance has fallen 98%](https://beincrypto.com/ethereum-sees-98-decrease-in-eth-issuance-since-merge/). This has the effect of massively reducing inflation to roughly the percentage amount, easily above 90%. This can be compared to burning. Burning is a permanent method of removing supply from circulation and decreasing inflation while staking can be thought of a temporary version of this, until stake is released/unlocked. Over the past 24 hours, ETH supply has been up by 0.34%. Under PoW, it would have been 3.86% over this same period.",21.0,2022-09-26 12:09:11,0.79
Where have ETH miners gone - 10 days later,"*(NOTE: I am moving to an every-four-day cadence on these posts.  The next post will be Thursday.)*

The GPU mining hashrate actually *increased* over the last 2 days, fueled mostly by significant increases in hashrate from the two new Ethereum forks.  ETHW mining increased by 55.2%, and Ethereum Fair increased by 248.8%.

26.61% (up 0.83% in 2 days) of the former ETH network has moved to mining some other coin. 18.42% (up 0.63%) have moved to an alternate Ethhash coin, and 8.2% (up 0.21%) have moved to a non-Ethash coin.

73.39% (\~10.7 million RTX 3070 equivalents) of the former Ethereum network is no longer mining.  This is *down* an average of 60,523 RTX 3070s per day over the last two days.

For an RTX 3070 (considering energy costs for only the GPU portion of mining rigs), the most profitable five coins at $0.05 per kWh energy average 18.2% more profit than they did two days ago.  At $0.10 per kWh, losses are 20.4% smaller. 

Of note, the top five most profitable coins aren't necessarily the ones people *actually* mine, and only represent just under 24% of current GPU mining.  The top five most mined coins (representing 87.33% of current GPU mining) make 75% less than the most profitable ones at 5c per kWh, and lose 85% more at 10c per kWh.

ebay sales had another spike in volume this weekend.  The average sale price is down 2.35% from two days ago.  It would take 8.9 years mining at 5 cents per kWh to make as much money on an RTX 3070 as selling the card in eBay.

Kraken post merge ethereum staking rewards. Zero increase?,This is the first full week after merge. I just checked my latest weekly staking rewards at Kraken and see that they did not increase and even slightly decreased as usual. Before the merge I had an idea that post merge rewards will increase as stakers will now receive transaction fees which earlier went to miners. Also I read that Kraken very actively use MEV to generate additional profit. But currently stakers get nothing. What do you think about that? Is it right and fair?,40.0,2022-09-25 07:08:20,0.93
How the hell is crypto still “up” this week relative to the general financial markets right now?,"Every since the Federal Reserve raised interest rates again a few days ago markets everywhere have been getting pummeled… Stocks are getting devastated and a lot of them are under their 52 week lows again; commodities are getting decimated and the price of oil is crashing; the dollar is getting stronger than ever but other currencies are getting crushed; bond yields are soaring; the yield curve is inverting; and literally everywhere you look there’s a sea of deep red in all of the financial markets except crypto… Somehow crypto isn’t budging and we’ve even pumped a little these past few days. 

With that being said there’s a lot going on so can somebody tell me how the hell most cryptocurrencies are still floating comfortably above their 52 week (June) lows? When I look at the markets crypto is the only thing that’s still showing green. I know that we had a few events lately that pumped the crypto markets (Ethereum merge hype, Algo FIFA partnership, Cardano vasil hardfork anticipation, etc) but it still doesn’t make sense to me how it’s just chugging along when the rest of the markets are on fire (especially because it’s considered a “risk on” asset). 

What do you guys think of this here? How are we still staying afloat right now? Are we finally deviating from the NASDAQ? Will we test lows again? Let’s discuss.

Where have ETH miners gone - 8 days later...,"**EDIT:** Reuploaded the charts and added alternate Imgur links above each chart.  I don't know why images uploaded direct to Reddit keep disappearing...

*Someone pointed out on my last post that the other Ethereum fork wasn't included in my prior posts.  So, Ethereum Fair has been retrospectively added to this analysis.  It's currently the #10 most transitioned-to altcoin, having absorbed 0.3% of Ethereum's hashrate.*

Shedding of GPU cryptomining hashrate continues at a similar rate as the previous 2 days.  74.22% of the ETH network is no longer mining, up 2.4% from 2 days ago (this is equivalent to 67.3% of *all* pre-merge GPU cryptominers, up 1.9% from 2 days ago).  10.81 million RTX 3070 equivalents have been shut off, increasing at a current rate of \~170k per day.

25.78% of the former ETH network remained transitioned to some other coin (17.79% to a different Ethash coin; 7.99% to non-Ethash coins).

Optimal mining profits are down again for the last two days. Losses have increased by 11.3% at 10c per kWh, and profits have decreased by 10.2% at 5c per kWh.  The average eBay selling price is also down 0.6%.  At 5 cents per kWh, it would currently take 10.8 years to make as much profit mining with an RTX 3070 as you'd make selling the card on eBay (not considering energy costs of non-GPU components in the mining rig).

A simple guide on how to lose your precious crypto to scams. Part 3.,"Are you tired of all these scam warning posts that pop up on Reddit and twitter. Well today, I'm going to do the opposite. I'm going to tell you exactly how to lose all your crypto to scams, again! There seems to be new fans from [Part 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/xjvohv/a_simple_guide_on_how_to_lose_your_precious/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) and [Part 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/xj7l1m/a_simple_guide_on_how_to_lose_your_precious/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) on my series. Some took on board my advice and lost their [holdings](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/xjvohv/comment/ipatx6s/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3). LOL. ""Two things are infinite: the universe and **crypto scams**; and I’m not sure about the universe!"" - Einstein, \[adapted\]. Some people were complaining last time that I sounded like a Motley Fool article, so I've lightened things down a bit. Anyways, here is part 3 now:

&#x200B;

1. **Sweeper bots** \- You hop onto your favourite crypto circlejerk subreddit r/SafeMoon, and see a post of someone giving away their wallet seed phrase with $1,000 worth of Safemoon. It's your lucky day! You enter the wallet seed phrase onto Trust Wallet and there it is: $1,000 of Safemoon. You then deposit $30 of BNB because there isn't enough (or any) BNB for gas to withdraw it to your own address. You withdraw it, and gleefully simile as you are going to be $1,000 richer. 3 minutes later, nothing, 30 minutes later, nothing, and finally you decide to investigate on the chain explorer. You look at it and you have no idea what happened and decide to complain on r/cryptocurrency. Someone replies saying that you got swept. LOL! You lost $30 and got baited!
2. **Imposter scams** \- After eating a bag of Doritos you 500lb slob, you get a message on Twitter from the one and only Vitalik Buterin! Apparently, he is out of Ethereum and needs some ETH for the Merge to work. He says he will return twice the amount back to you once it is done. Hmm, you find it implausible that the founder of Ethereum needs ETH but then he sends a screenshot of his MetaMask wallet balance being zero. That's all it took for you. You send your entire balance of 0.24 ETH and he says 'thank you'. Like the last scam, you waited and hoped but you did not learn your lesson. LOL! You got scammed by Vitalik Buterin ~~a 15 year old boy~~!
3. **""Validate your seed phrase"" scams** \- This one got requested by u/_Royal_Insylum. You are checking your emails, something from 14 hours ago from Trust-Wallet pops up offering you $30 of free Bitcoin if you validate your seed phrase through the link. You have heard a million times before: Don't click links from people you don't trust. You tell yourself: 'But it's Trust Wallet! It's in their name!' You have a feeling that this is a bad idea, but the $30 of free Bitcoin overcomes your sense of paranoia. You find a piece of paper of your 12 word seed phrase and type all of it up on the 'Trust Wallet Support' website. You tell yourself again: 'You're going to be $30 richer after this!' And done. In real time, your wallet address drains as your bitcoin goes first, then your BNB and the 3/42 worthwhile tokens you have disappears. OH NO NOT YOUR DOGE! LOL! You just got scammed.
4. **Ponzi Schemes** \- You see an ad on Facebook (who uses that trash anymore?) of a crypto investment group that can 100x your money in 90 days. As if your 12% APY on Crypto.com wasn't enough you greedy pig. You click on the link to see if it is legit. Sure enough they've introduced you to their entire [team](https://www.reddit.com/r/cryptocurrencymemes/comments/xdcng1/shady_crypto_projects_be_like/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)! Of course, guys in suits? Check. Famous names? Check. Reputation? Eh, that doesn't matter when there is 100x on your returns. You check the reviews this time. >!Good on you learning from the previous time with that dodgy exchange.!<5/5 stars. That's all you needed, but check the first review for extra affirmation: 'My $1,000 deposit turned into $69,000 after 1 month! Can't believe it is legit (with a screenshot).' You go back to their site, open a new account, and deposit $1,000 of USDT since they accept crypto as well. Bye bye Civic, hello Lambo! 3 months later you have decided you have waited long enough. $134,000 waiting to be withdrawn. You withdraw it, they need to sign it off. Shouldn't take too long. 1 hour passes and you can't wait. 1 hour turns into 1 day as you start to become a little suspicious. You check the reviews again and this time it crashed to 1.3/5 stars. ""Ponzi Scheme - WARNING."" ""SCAM ALERT"" - that is all you see. LOL! You got Ponzi Schemed and say bye bye to your USDT.
5. **Fraudulent job offers** \- You've lost a lot of money from these scams lately and you need to pay that rent. Flipping burgers at Macca's isn't cutting it. You list down all the things you are good at, 'crypto' is the only thing you have written down. Surely there are jobs out there that specialise in cryptocurrency. You search online for 'crypto jobs' and the first thing that comes up is an upcoming Korean exchange offering many positions. You tell yourself - leadership shouldn't be too hard and you apply for project manager. Within two minutes, you get an email reply asking you to message them privately on Telegram. 'Unusual. But who am I to question? I've only worked in Macca's before so I shouldn't be surprised' - you tell yourself. You download Telegram and setup your account with a proper email, >!not p0ssyslayer3000@email.com!<. You message a guy named King John-Une with a fat Korean guy with a weird haircut. That sounds familiar but you don't know who it reminds you of. He tells you that you can get the job instantly with the salary at 500k a year but you have to pay for the training. You ask on telegram: ""how much is training?"" and he replies with ""3k but you can pay in bitcoin to this address."" Finally, a real life use for crypto. You accept and then pay the bitcoin to King John-Une. Then he replies with ""we will get you sorted quickly"". Then you get BLOCKED! For a minute, your gullible brain went into freeze as you realised you got scammed yet again! LOL!
6. **Telegram pump signal group chat scams** \- Since you have now downloaded Telegram, you have been randomly invited to group chats with links to other dodgy telegram group chats. Yet, you've done the smart thing and left these groups. You are finally learning from your mistakes! Ooh, you've just been invited by Elon Musk on telegram to join his 20,000 member Crypto Moon Shots Group chat. Now, you are a big fan of Elon and once invested into Dogecoin in 2017 and he pumped your coin up. You sold all your DOGE in early May 2022 and you have enough funds to have been scammed 17 times and still have a lot of funds remaining. >!Still not enough to buy a lambo LOL!!< You decide to join as you don't have much to lose right now and there looks like there is a lot to gain. Oh wow! Looking at the last signal pumps you see the pumps they did: 647%, 235% 89%. You want in. There is one happening tonight at 7pm on a random exchange. You load up on DOGE and wait. Now it is 7pm. The coin chosen is CHTA/DOGE pair, a coin that has mooned before but on low volume. You quickly rush in, one tab on Telegram, and the other on the exchange. You buy as quickly as possible, filling all the buy orders and creating some sell orders (just like the group chat told you). You HOLD as long as possible. Up 34%. 156%. 388%. 547%. 1349%. HODL. Then just as the green candle skyrocketed, it falls red hard and CHTA is down 30%. You didn't just loose 30% as you bought high, you lost 80%. Fat L. You complain on the Telegram and they reply with ""be faster next time bro."" You decide to investigate, a large spike of volume was occurred a week earlier, the exact same as the one that dumped the coin in the first place. You realise that you got scammed yet again by a pump signals group. LOL!

Is it just me or is MATIC severely undervalued right now?,"With many things happening all at once such as the Ethereum merge going on, SEC vs Ripple, etc., everybody has been focused on ETH's price action, and the sustainability of BTC's market cap lead and if or when the flippening of the two will happen. I notice that while these two asset classes or more volatile, MATIC, in comparison has been more stable. From what I've researched so far, it has great fundamentals and performance, along with partnerships with blue chip companies like Disney and Starbucks. I think right now is a good time to buy. any opinions on whether it's being overlooked right now, or where Polygon can go?",28.0,2022-09-21 20:30:05,0.9
A Vested Interest In The Future of GME(RICA): An Abridged Version; Regarding BoBBY/BaBY Acquisition (Rev. 3),"Foreword:

You: “Tell me of Perseus, Papa Ignoble?”

Me: “Come close, gather ‘round my son, and join me at the hearth. Listen well to my tale.”

Ryan Cohen and his expanding Merry Band of Badasses established a rally point in Gamestop via the turn around. They are using the company Gamestop as a vehicle for innovative change in the socio-economics civilization that probably should have already been happening over the last 40~ years. GMERICA Entertainment, Blockchain Integrations, and the NFT Platform are all troop movements to gain ground on the metaphysical ‘big-bad’.


Main:


**1.)**	If I had to guess, I would say that the Merry Band of Badasses have acquired the meat and potatoes of Loopring as a corporation. They likely purchased either a (restrictive?) License to or the entirety of the Loopring Patent regarding Blockchain Decentralized Exchange(s). This would give them leverage against anyone in Finance, Commerce/Industry, or the Government giving them a hedge against corruption, cronyism, or metaphorical kill-switches. It also creates a demand from their peers in the market(s), “Get on board, get with it, or get out of our way!” This would explain why they have so many direct and indirect integrating partners. This would explain the tide of the Government and private financial cornerstones of Wallstreet turning away from Banks and Hedgies involved in this mess. Think Congress reevaluating Family Office Taxes, think the DoJ and SEC moving into CBOE in Chicago, think OCC, NSCC, DTCC et all gradually making policy changes to ensure that when the economic draw down (fallout from naked shorting and swaps) happens that the United States Economy will survive.

**2.)**	 The Loopring DEX has been built as Gamestop’s NFT Platform while integrating Inter-Planetary File System by Piñata. You have Ethereum, (Layer 01). Then you have Loopring, (Layer 01). Then you have Loopring (Layer 02). Then you have the Loopring DEX known as Gamestop’s NFT Platform. This entity has been built to uniquely identify every asset with a unique identifier as to prevent deception or fraud. This entity has also been built to allow integration from every proposed partner who wishes to work with the Platform while adhering to the Terms of Service/Terms of Use that prohibit certain actions and behaviors. This is where the direct partners like Loopring, Immutable X come in. This is where their respective partners also come in. A rising tide lifts all boats, but the NFT Platform is a digital city. There’s room for everyone who wants to put skin in the game.


**3.)**	Gamestop has successfully filed with the SEC to act as an Agent or Trustee of another corporation. This allows them to handle the Securities and Stock of *other* corporations, in example a cell corporation or division operating under their umbrella. This means they can not only operate GMERICA Entertainment LLC (which has subtly been registered as an entity in nations all over the world), but create & distribute company stock on GMERICA’s behalf. They can also officiate acquisitions and mergers involving GMERICA or any cell corporation or division under their banner. They could even reverse-merge with GMERICA allowing GMERICA to be a parent company of Gamestop. (Think Alphabet and Google.) They are free to restructure their developing technology conglomerate at will.

**4.)**	I believe that Private Equity had worked together with Banks and Hedgies to establish Swaps between stocks that were Naked Shorted directly or through ETFs (Meme Basket). Ryan Cohen established a position within BoBBY for the purpose of Activism Investing to destabilize these Swaps. He removed the previous executives due to them running BoBBY into the ground, lessening Bearish Confidence in BoBBY. He initiated a turnaround by installing new executives who all specialize in preparing corporations for Acquisitions and Mergers. He seems to have reached an agreement with the Board of Directors. They seem to be following a plan congruent with the Gamestop Turnaround. Thus, the Naked Shorts and Swaps involving BoBBY are destabilized. Directly or indirectly Swaps against Naked Shorts on Gamestop are destabilized.


**5.)**	The Acquisition or Merger with GME(RICA). BoBBY has a Market Capacity of 607,678,132 by way of 79.96M shares at Market Value. Reported Annual Revenue of 7.868B. BoBBY has recently acquired new financing, secured supply and logistics, and is on it's way to a turn around with a still-building rollout from the Board of Directors/Executives. Assets under management, they could sell BaBY for $2-4B. They could also keep BaBY and be acquired as a whole. How? Gamestop has $900m~ in cash, and a Revolving Credit Facility amounting to $500m~.

Gamestop has 304.52~ million shares available to the public as well as 5.00~ million preferred stock, and 8~ million Class A Common Stock available as compensation and incentives to their employees. We’ll say 318 million even. They still have a ceiling of 1,005,000,000 Class A Stock, leaving roughly 682~ million available for the Board of Directors to work with. What can happen in an Acquisition or Merger? Stock Distributions. They can afford to enfranchise BoBBY/BaBY Holders.

* If BoBBY rolls into GME then BoBBY holders will likely get GME(RICA) Stock.

* If BoBBY spins off BaBY then BoBBY holders will likely get BaBY Stock.

* If BoBBY spins off BaBY, and then BaBY is acquired by GME(RICA) what does it mean? If this happens BoBBY holders keep their original investment in BoBBY, they get BaBY Stock, and they get rolled into GME(RICA) when the acquisition happens. (*Would this be a Grand Slam or a Triple Play for BoBBY Holders*?)


> [I am holding out for Option 3, because it is a Jackpot, Maximum Moon Tickets!](https://i.imgur.com/oV9iHdc.png) 


**6.)**	There are two ways you can close out all trading on a company. Withdrawal from the DTCC/Cede & Co. Acquisition or Merger with another entity. Not even bankruptcy/insolvency closes trading or removes shares. I don't think Gamestop's stock will be fully direct registered for a few more years. I don't think that Gamestop is ready to prove that the DTCC is acting in bad faith as a Fiduciary of Gamestop Stock.",26.0,2022-09-21 01:13:56,0.88
SEC claims the US govt has jurisdiction over all Ethereum network transactions now that ETH has transitioned to proof-of-stake & the majority of nodes being run are in the US. Do you think the SEC might eventually sue ETH like it did XRP for unlawfully issuing securities?,"Ethereum \[ETH\] has been one of the most-talked about cryptocurrencies over the past few weeks, with major updates like the Merge taking place. Apart from this, the network’s transition into proof-of-stake \[PoS\] has been fueling rumors about ETH being categorized as a security. Now, further strengthening this argument, the SEC in a lawsuit against crypto influencer Ian Balina claimed that ETH transactions automatically fall under the US government’s jurisdiction due to the majority of nodes being run in the country.

Balina was sued for allegedly offering unregistered tokens. He was caught in trouble after he failed to register his project as a security before rolling out an initial coin offering \[ICO\] in 2018. The crypto influencer outrightly denied these claims. However, the crypto community is currently speculating on SEC’s massive statement in the lawsuit. According to the 69th paragraph, the lawsuit stated that it had the right to sue Balina because the SEC had jurisdiction over the Ethereum network.

It was reported that a variety of U.S.-based investors participated in the Balina-curated investment pool. A network of Ethereum blockchain nodes further verified a number of ETH contributions. Due to this, the SEC stated,

“ETH contributors were validated by a network of nodes on the Ethereum blockchain, which are clustered more densely in the United States than in any other country. As a result, those transactions took place in the United States.”

Additionally, it should be noted that at present 42.56 percent or 3340 of the 7819 Ethereum nodes reside in the US.

**Will this statement take a toll on the Ethereum network?**

The Ethereum network has been dealing with immense backlash following the Merge. As mentioned earlier, some were suggesting that the network would fall under the SEC’s purview as it would now be considered a security. A few others on the other hand were taking digs at ETH’s level of decentralization.

Amidst all of this, the latest statement made by the SEC would be detrimental to the network. Even though several legal professionals noted that the complaint’s phrasing would have no legal significance, it would nevertheless be noticed.",38.0,2022-09-20 13:30:21,0.89

As we can see, there are only **three** relays currently (bloXroute Max Profit, bloXroute Ethical, and Manifold Finance) that claim to not censor their blocks. All the others (in particular Flashbots) do. 

I **strongly** recommend that my fellow stakers do not use any of the relays which censor, e.g. according to the OFAC list. Ethereum is a neutral settlement layer, much like an ISP, and does not and should not care about the content/transactions being processed by the network. Censorship is an unnecessary, reactive, harmful step to take, and the Ethereum staking community should vigorously reject such relays and not give them any blockspace until they grow a backbone and stop censoring.",117.0,2022-09-20 08:40:54,0.98
Best arguments to refute post-merge centralization accusations?,"I'm a solo staker and I rejoice over the merge success. I truly am.

There's however a lot of FUD these days about how centralized ethereum has become post-merge, like:

[40%+ of Ethereum PoS nodes are controlled by 2 addresses, says Santiment data](https://cointelegraph.com/news/40-ethereum-pos-nodes-are-controlled-by-two-addresses-says-santiment-data)

[Flashbots builds over 82% relay blocks, adding to Ethereum centralization](https://cointelegraph.com/news/flashbots-build-over-82-relay-blocks-adding-to-ethereum-centralization)

I know that's not the intent of the merge, but what are some of the best arguments to refute these claims? If Coinbase or Lido or Flashbots do decide to collude and mess with the transactions (by changing, censoring, or prioritizing transactions), what will happen next? Can someone provide both a governance-level and a technical-level answer how things actually work under the hood? 

Now I won't accept an answer anywhere along the lines of: ""Oh, we have slashing mechanisms in place. Nobody will dare to do it, lest they be slashed. Just trust the system. Everything will be fine."" or ""Coinbase's CEO Brian Armstrong already promised that he'd rather pull out from the staking business than being forced to censor transactions. We should trust that he'll keep his word.""

No, we trust no one in crypto. The fundamental principle in crypto is to assume the worst intentions of human beings wanting to cheat the system. If people could do it, they will do it. We only trust the code to enforce decentralization principles. We can never trust people not daring to do bad things.

And Vitalik has always been a huge proponent of decentralization. How did he respond to these accusations that ethereum is now heavily centralized post-merge?

Proof of Stake is a regressive capital tax system,"**TL:DR: Proof of Stake is a regressive capital tax system. It leads to the rich getting richer, subsidised by the poor. The post below explains why this is the case and why this is worrying from a security perspective as this leads to ever less security and decentralization over time.**

I'm using ETH as an example in this post because the merge just happened but the same holds for other Proof of Stake cryptocurrencies.

# **""Staking is a great way to get passive income.""**

In ETH, staking rewards are a combination of block rewards, transaction fees (tips), and MEV. 

* **Block rewards** are simple. Every time a block is added to the blockchain, the person that added the block is rewarded with X ETH.
* **Transaction fees** are slightly more complicated.  There's a base fee, which is largely burnt, and ""tips"", which are an additional fee to get your transaction prioritized ([see this article for more info\)](https://cryptobriefing.com/eip-1559-ethereums-fee-burning-proposal-explained/).
* **MEV** is a whole other story. [You can go down the rabbit hole here](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/mev/) and start wondering how fair this is. In short, MEV is value that stakers can extract by including, excluding and changing the order of transactions in a block in their favor. 

Projections on ETH's staking rewards differ, in this thread I use [@dunleavy89's](https://twitter.com/dunleavy89/status/1569768259649679360) because they are easy to understand and seem reasonable. For his projections, [see this image.](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Fcjvul5XEAArlBe?format=png&name=900x900)

Using the base figures, there's a total reward of 11% for staking, with 1.1% deflation due to ""fee burning"", meaning a total reward of 12.1%. This seems pretty good - because it is, for those that can get the 12.1% return. If you checked @dunleavy89's figures, you'll see that most ETH is not staked. Out of ~120 mln total supply, only ~14 mln is staked. Why is this, when it seems like an easy way to set up a passive income stream?

# Tiers of Ethereum stakers

There are multiple hurdles to staking. You need 32 ETH (~$50,000) to stake, or 16 ETH using Rocket Pool. You also need to have a dedicated computer connected to the internet 24/7. If you tick both those boxes: bravo, [you're a tier 1 user](https://ethereum.org/en/staking/solo/) and can get maximum rewards.

However - does this describe you? Do you have such a large amount of ETH and do you feel comfortable setting this up & maintaining it yourself? The most likely answer is no, which means you won't be a **tier 1** user.

If you have sufficient ETH but lack the technical know-how, you can use [""Staking as a service""](https://ethereum.org/en/staking/saas/). You deposit your 32 ETH, but outsource the node operations to a third party processor (for a small fee). Bravo, you're a **tier 2** user with tier 2 rewards!

Tier 3: [Pooled staking](https://cryptotesters.com/ethereum-staking-platforms) has no minimum, you don't have to run a node, but you do still have to lock up some ETH that you then can't use. More importantly, you will be paying fees to the pool owner, usually about 10%. That's what you get for being **tier 3.**

Then there's **tier 4**, where you [stake on an exchange](https://help.coinbase.com/en/coinbase/trading-and-funding/coinbase-earn/eth-2-0-staking). The fee they charge tends to be even higher than that of pooled staking. It's the easiest option by far, and the least profitable one when staking.

Summarizing: 4 tiers of staking.

1. Stake minimum 16/32 ETH, run own node, full rewards.
2. Stake minimum 16/32 ETH, outsource node, small fee paid.
3. No minimum stake, no node, ~10% fees.
4. No minimum stake, on exchange, ~20% fees.

# Regular users

However, there's a hidden **tier 5**.

Tier 5 is the 80-90% of ETH holders that don't stake at all. These are the ones that are losing out.. hard. Whereas [in the base scenario mentioned earlier](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FcpDAspXgAM58Pa?format=png&name=900x900) the reward could be 12.1%, these tier 5 users get just 1.1%.

It might seem like this is not too bad. After all, even tier 5 gets *some* rewards. They're gaining 1.1% per year, just from ETH being deflationary. However, there are a few things to keep in mind here. First, ""compound interest is the 8th wonder of the world"". Those gaining most keep gaining most, week after week after week. Given that we're in the decentralized digital currency space, this increasing centralization of stakes and thus power is worrying, which I'll get back to. Second off, we've completely ignored the fact that fees exist for users on Ethereum, and that fee burning is the reason ETH is becoming deflationary in the first place.

According to Glassnode, there are ~4 million active wallets (holding a minimum of 0.1 ETH each). In the base case scenario we are counting on $3,840,000,000 or 2.4 mln ETH being paid in fees per year. That means, on average, over 0.5 ETH being paid, per address, per year, just in fees. Even if we take the ""very conservative"" estimate, where fees are far lower because there isn't much usage of the chain, it's 0.15 ETH paid per account per year.

4 million active addresses, with a market cap of ~$200 billion or 120mln ETH. Let's run some simple calculations with this. The average ETH holder has ~$50,000 worth of ETH, or 30 ETH. Note that this is an average ETH holder. You're probably seeing these figures and thinking ""I hold far less"", and you'd be correct. Let's roll with it. I'll explain why this analysis is far worse if we use realistic figures.

This ""average"" 30ETH holder pays average fees per year. From 0.15 ETH in the very conservative scenario to 1.05 ETH in the aggressive scenario. [What happens to their ETH holdings after a year?
](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Fcr6P-OWAAAqGMb?format=png&name=medium)

Before taking into account inflation/deflation, their holdings decrease, by between 0.15 (lowest fees) to 1.05 (highest fees) or 0.5% to 3.5%. This makes sense, they start with 30 ETH, pay fees, so they have less ETH at the end of the year. If we add in the much-touted deflationary nature of ETH following the merge the figures change slightly, but not massively. The 30 ETH holder still loses out, losing 0.6% to 1.2% of his ETH after a year.

# Small holders losing out

As mentioned before, a 30 ETH holder is.. slightly unrealistic. If you hold 30 ETH then congrats to you, but this is clearly not going to be the case for most people. Most people will likely be closer to 3 ETH than to 30 ETH. 

However, when you do an ETH transaction, the network does not care how much ETH you hold. If you hold 100 ETH and pay a 0.1 ETH transaction fee, your transaction is prioritised over a 1 ETH holder paying a 0.09 ETH fee, despite this being ""more"" for the small holder.

This means that transaction fees hurt small holders far more than big holders. Using a real-world analogy: when you make $5,000,000 you will usually spend more than someone making $50,000 a year, but you won't do 100x more transactions. Your transaction size will simply increase. Likewise, someone holding 30 (or 3,000) ETH might do bigger transactions than someone holding 3 ETH, but is unlikely to transact, on average, 10x (or 1,000x) as often.

What this means for the small holder is that while they might pay less total fees in absolute terms, relative to their holdings they are most likely paying far more than the big holders. When you have $100 and pay a transaction fee of $1 this has a far larger impact than someone with $100,000 having to pay a transaction fee of $1. It's a 1% fee for one, and a 0.001% fee for the other.

Fun fact that becomes important at this point: staking your ETH is a transaction. Unstaking your ETH is a transaction. Both come with fees.

When you hold 32 ETH and can set up your own node, a two-time fee of say 0.05 ETH isn't all too bad. When you hold 3 ETH, pay a transaction fee of 0.05 ETH to start staking, then pay fees of 10-15% over your staking rewards and 0.05 ETH to unstake again.. it's not as good. On a sidenote, who do you think owns the staking pools and rakes in the fees? Hint: they're usually not small parties, because it takes 32/16 ETH to set up a pool.

**Re-summarizing: large ETH holders transact relatively more cheaply & get higher staking rewards. Smaller holders transact relatively more expensively and either pay (large) pool owners fees over their staking rewards or don't stake at all, subsidising the big stakers.**

This doesn't even take into account the fact that when staking, your tokens are temporarily locked. See it as a term deposit versus a checking account. As many of us are probably well aware, those that have little money keep relatively more in their checking accounts, while the more money you have, the more you can afford to ""lock up"" and invest. When you have only $500, you prefer it liquid in case an emergency comes up. As a large holder you might hold 35 ETH and be able to lock up 32 ETH leaving you 3 ETH for daily use, but as a small holder with 3.5 ETH it would really impact my liquidity to lock up 3.2 ETH.

**In other words, not only do large stakers pay relatively lower transaction fees and get higher staking rewards, they can afford to get this profit over a larger percentage of their holdings.**

# Unfairness and decentralization impact

While for large holders[ the aforementioned 5.6% to 17.8% real staking yield](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FcsYakrXEAAKbgm?format=png&name=900x900) might be accurate, this comes at the expense of smaller ETH holders.

Or, as @udiWertheimer put it, [you don't get paid to stake, you get penalized for not staking.](https://twitter.com/udiWertheimer/status/1569191118260293633)

This also makes sense from a very fundamental point of view. Ethereum's market cap does not increase by staking. What staking does is redistribute the value already present within ETH - from the poor to the rich, from non-stakers to stakers, from small stakers to big stakers.

Small users don't stake because it's not worth the fees, they don't want to lock up, and it's too much hassle. They pay fees to use the network, and have less ETH year after year. Large holders profit from this, being the ones staking, the ones that have ETH to lock up, happily paying the transaction fees that to them represent just a small % of their holdings. They'll gladly do it next year too - with even more ETH staked.

This feels unfair. The rich get richer exponentially faster in absolute and relative terms than those that are poorer. Imagine we were taxed 50% on your first $50k capital gains, 25% on the next $50k, then just 10% for everything over that.

The fairness angle is one perspective. However, we're in crypto. Security arises from decentralization. The impact of this PoS reward system on decentralization should be obvious. Every day this system runs, the system becomes more centralized. The big get bigger, every day. To me this is worrying. Just to be clear, I hold ETH. I wholeheartedly support the move to Proof of Stake. That doesn't mean Proof of Stake is perfect, though. Ignoring the problem won't make it go away, and the problem gets bigger the longer we allow it to run.

# Solutions?

Are there solutions? Sure. Decrease transaction fees. Decrease staking rewards. Make it cheaper and easier to stake. Decrease minimum staking amounts. The problem will still keep getting bigger every day, but it would help slow it down. None of these solutions is a full fix, and I'd love to hear what Ethereum enthusiasts think of the long-term trajectory of this system.

For what it's worth, I think a full fix could look similar to Nano's [Open Representative Voting](https://senatus.substack.com/p/how-nanos-lack-of-fees-provides-all-the-right-incentives-ee7be4d2b5e8). It does away with all monetary incentives. No fees, no supply changes, no centralization over time.

Nano and Ethereum are very different, with one focusing on being decentralized pure money and the other acting as a platform, having smart contracts, allowing for NFTs and such. Perhaps Nano's solutions aren't 1-to-1 applicable to Ethereum. Regardless, it's worth looking into the incentives present in both cryptocurrencies. We're all in crypto because we believe there is value in decentralization. This centralization over time inherent in Proof of Stake to me seems like a serious long-term threat, that we should tackle.

**I'd love to hear what people's thoughts on this subject are here, whether you also see this as a (potential) issue and what you think solutions might look like.**",378.0,2022-09-19 07:51:56,0.71
"Debunking the myth on the ""controversial"" RPi4 staker","I am a Eth2 staker since March 2021, when I decided to participate in the eth2 staking game. As in PoS we are not talking about ASICs but COTS hardware, I first had to decide on what hardware to pick. I saw guides/blogs/reddit posts suggesting NUCs, laptops, desktops or even server racks, and some of them had the ""controversial"" RPi4 at the bottom, marked as ""proceed with your risk"". I decided to take the risk, putting my 32 ETH ""at stake"". I also bought a 2TB MX500 and a StarTech USB3/SATA adapter.

2. ""RPi4 staking might not be feasible in the future"".

A: This had some rationale before the merge. Indeed, the overall resource requirements went up a bit after the merge. This forced me to migrate from lighthouse to nimbus (as lighthouse simply could not keep up). But with the merge behind us, I do not see a reason for the resource requirements to go further up. On the contrary, developers are currently implementing ""light"" EL/CL clients:

[https://nimbus.guide/philosophy.html](https://nimbus.guide/philosophy.html)

[https://github.com/status-im/nimbus-eth1](https://github.com/status-im/nimbus-eth1)

Regardless, if for some reason the resource requirements go up in the future, I can still migrate to a Rock5 B which is more than enough.

3. ""Not significant power savings"".

A: My Pi power consumption (passively cooled, including SSD) is less than 6 Watts **\*at the wall\*** (see [picture](https://i.imgur.com/g0dQ9Ek.jpg)). This translates to a couple of dollars per year in the electricity bill (or a bit more, depending on the country). Had everybody used Pi's for staking, the overall power consumption reduction would be 99.99% instead of 99.95% compared to PoW.

4. ""You have 32 ETH = $50000 at stake. Why not invest $1000 for decent hardware?""

A: I see this argument all the time. Honestly I don't understand why people like to overkill that much. The whole idea behind PoS is to be as minimal and efficient as possible, moving away from expensive hardware, which made consensus participation an ""expensive hobby"". I think the goal of Ethereum PoS is to be able eventually to participate in consensus with basic hardware such as phones. Also see #1, #2 above. The only benefit you get from using overkill hardware (e.g. i5's, i7's) is that you have less downtime in case you lose sync or during pruning. But do a few missed attestations justify this cost? I believe no (exception: you have an old laptop not being used, which could be easily turned into a staking machine with zero cost).

&#x200B;

Overall I am enjoying my journey in staking with RPi a lot. I feel that I'm part of the push to be as efficient as possible, and incentivize developers to bring down their resource requirements for staking.

Who knows, maybe in the future someone will sell cheap Pi's ready to stake out of the box, taking away the technical challenges and making staking more appealing to the average user (who now only has the option to stake with Coinbase etc., leading to centralization).

Post-Merge NFT Sales Surge 1.75X And Popular NFT's Blast Off 75%-200%,"This Bloomberg article is available to those who have access: [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-09-15/hard-hit-nfts-see-sales-surge-after-anticipated-ethereum-merge)

For everyone else I'll breakdown the gist of it.

Post-merge, both sales volume and prices of NFTs have surged.

* OpenSea, saw trading volume increase 77% to $10 million as of Thursday afternoon
* The  average price of an NFT on the platform soared 227% to $114 early  Thursday, but has settled at $105, a 74% increase from the day before
* Even Magic Eden, which mostly sells Solana-based NFTs, experienced a boost,  with volume rising 36% to $4.6 million before currently has $4.4 million  in sales, a 19% increase from the day before
* Bored Ape Yacht Club saw $1.3 million in sales as Thursday afternoon, a 187% increase from 24 hours before
* CryptoPunks recorded a rise in trading volume of 56% to $1.4 million for the same period

Sales have somewhat settled but are still higher the prior to the merge as of the last end-of-day sales of 15th September.",102.0,2022-09-19 00:04:52,0.8
What Has The ETH Merge Really Accomplished?,"Here we are a few days after the merge. There was a lot of hope(ium) passed around. It's not to say a pump didn't come, but it came before the merge when people thought it would come after it. As I saw a few users say, the merge was really a submerge of markets. Of course, there was never a guarantee for a pump. Typical buy the rumor, sell the news. News media certainly had a hand in the false hype.

On the upside, ETH has reduced its energy consumption by 99.9%. Not a  small thing, but what did it cost? Well, in our 'decentralised'  network, we had [67% of the stake controlled by just 7 seven entities](https://decrypt.co/109901/big-firms-dominate-post-merge-ethereum-validation).  On top of that, it costs 32 ETH to be a validator meaning that only the  few with that kind of capital have the ability to validate. Further, even less of that few would even do it because validating requires you  to lock up your funds. Currently, there is no ability to withdraw these  funds. Support for withdrawals are planned for the upcoming Shanghai upgrade but you should expect funds to stay locked up for one to two years.

Further, was the more decentralised PoW mining even that bad?  Cambridge studies in their 3rd Global Cryptoasset Benchmarking Study  shows that somewhere [a bit less than 40% of mining energy was renewable](https://www.jbs.cam.ac.uk/faculty-research/centres/alternative-finance/publications/3rd-global-cryptoasset-benchmarking-study/). A 2019 analysis by Coinshares shows that [74% of btc mining came from renewables.](https://coinshares.com/research/bitcoin-mining-network-june-2019) The Bitcoin Mining Council published that renewables energy constituted [around 60% of bitcoin energy used for mining](https://bitcoinminingcouncil.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/2022.07.19-BMC-Presentation-Q2-22-Presentation.pdf)  in Q2 2022.  There are a number of older studies that give different  numbers but generally these numbers range from 35%-70%. Keep in mind  these numbers are all only estimates with different methodologies but  they are the best we have.

It is clear that the environmental impact of mining was at least somewhat overblown, however as with all things it's not that simple as a  fair percentage of non-renewables was still used, and any energy not used for mining is generally redirected to some other purpose as humans  seek more and more comfort and efficiency in the classic wants vs  scarcity argument that is the heart of economics itself. The question  that we *should ask* is if this reduction of decentralization of a major crypto token is worth the energy cost. And that is a big question.

On the upside, fees have gone down although they really weren't  supposed to. ETH2 was only supposed to be a consensus change. It seems  to be more of a psychological effect than anything else with some  protocol/code efficiency improvements. For one, ETH network usage usage  has only increased for the month of September to-date, particularly  through and after the merge and this should have *increased* fees.

&#x200B;

[ETH\/ETH2 Transaction Per Day](https://preview.redd.it/unfgj75h8uo91.png?width=891&format=png&auto=webp&s=b4c43f36071f3dea4d28a1154c670b4acf9044e0)

Ironically, fees actually went down. I believe this is likely because the block time for ETH has become lower and (mostly) remarkably  consistent(although consistency might be bit too early to say) as there  is no longer the random and somewhat loose concept of PoW difficulty  that is impacted by average block time, in which miners jostle for  algorithm completion among each other. Meanwhile, hash rates constantly  vary as miners start and stop at random times and all these actions  occur under the purview of halving code itself. The confluence of all  this creates an unstable environment where predictability and  consistency is very difficult to produce. This is all in addition to the  concept of completed stale or uncled blocks. Uncled blocks are created  when two blocks are mined and broadcasted at the same time and one must  be accepted and the other discarded, or uncled. Approximately, 1 in  every 20 blocks are uncled, again in an unpredictable manner. A lot of  these factors are either non-existent or much more predictable of a PoS  consensus protocol.

More significantly, there's probably the psychological effect of users *believing* ETH to now be a more efficient system with cheaper gas fees and users simply funding transactions with less gas as they *believe* they would have less competition to complete a transaction in a short amount of time and the *feeling*  of faster transactions as block times are more consistent as well as  block times actually being somewhat lower as well that runs in a  beneficial feedback cycle that pushes fees lower. I think this is why  block times have fallen even further even after finalization of the  merge.

This is validated even further by the fact that both number of  transactions and transaction complexity, as seen through the proxy of  average transaction fees, which both should increase transaction fees by  themselves and increase it even more so together. And yet we have seen  transaction fees still falling.

It should be noted that the merge itself does pave the way for *direct* reductions in gas prices through sharding among other things. So it is a start if nothing else.

Thus, the merge has certainly had its fair share of controversy,  positivity and drawbacks. Some expectation were met while others, not so  much. I hope that as the merge hype has died down we are capable of  looking that the results logically and push for crypto more beneficial for everyone. Regardless, I'm ready for the downvotes.

Expect at least a year before you start seeing lower gas. The merge won’t reduce gas fees but it’s the first step in doing so.,"A decent number of people were expecting gas fees to quickly and suddenly decrease right after the merge, but that is far from the truth.

Technically, moving to PoS does register a very tiny decrease in gas fees, but that change is basically negligible.  
The only thing that changes for now is energy consumption which will see a huge 99.9% decrease.

If you’re waiting for gas fees to become low, you’re going to have to wait at least a year from now until sharding gets implemented.

Even then, Ethereum itself won’t be cheap and never will if devs stick to the current roadmap.  
What Sharding will do is facilitate a groundwork for EVM compatible L2s to help scale Ethereum.  
And with enough time and upgrades down the line, L2s will basically become a part of Ethereum itself. They’ll be indistinguishable.

Implementing scalability into the Ethereum chain itself would have taken a lot more time, energy, and resources.  
Meanwhile, L2s have been doing this for a while and they have the facilities, flexibility, and infrastructure to keep developing better ways to scale Ethereum.

Ethereum would need to a lot more time to test out scalability since a ton of private funds are on the line. Meanwhile, an L2 like Polygon for example has been doing this for years and they even have the groundwork for it. They have an entire data availability scaling solution which is the entire focus of sharding in the first place.

Sharding is officially slated for mid 2023 but considering that mishaps and extra testing might be happening especially after the delays that we experienced with the merge, I’m expecting sharding to get rolled out at least end of 2023

But that’s okay because current L2s are already doing a great job honestly but sharding will be the nail in the coffin for any criticism regarding Ethereum and I’m here to see all of that unroll.",53.0,2022-09-18 15:13:56,0.72

# MATT FINESTONE STEPPING DOWN

 As of this past monday (12/9), Matt Finestone had announced that he would be stepping down as the head of blockchain at Gamestop.

The reason why he is stepping down has not been revealed, nor does it matter.

Matt has been a great (and funny) dude on twitter [(HERE)](https://twitter.com/finestonematt/), and to be honest I won't mince words about it and will just copy his own words here. I believe I speak for the entire community when I say Thank you for the comedy, entertainment and education you've given so many people.

&#x200B;

>I've recently moved on from my role as head of blockchain at GameStop. The past year and a half has been among the most meaningful of my life. I am so grateful to so many, and excited for what this motivated new division will continue to accomplish.  
Thank you to the GameStop blockchain team. You've made the experience exceptional. We went from 0 people to several dozen in short order, and everything we've built - from products to team culture - is due to you. The energy & care you put in is inspiring.  
Thank you to the GameStop org. as a whole. Getting a blockchain division started at such a large corp. is not trivial. It called upon tons of talent and energy from all corners of the org., and at all levels. It would not have been possible otherwise.  
Thank you to the GameStop community. The most powerful & positive group of people I've known. It goes without saying how foundational you are. Your energy, enthusiasm and emotion is legitimately the fuel that drives the team. It's been a great honour to build for & with you.  
I will always care deeply about this project, and will cherish watching it advance. I plan to continue working within the Ethereum ecosystem, and return closer to the protocol/infrastructure level. There's never been a more exciting time to be an Etherean.

Again thank you Matt, for everything. Personally I'm really excited to what you'll be doing next o7

#  FROM GOLDMAN TO NO MAN

Goldman is currently mounting up to get everyone back to 5 days in the office once again and if that wasn't bad enough they're now also saying BYO B/C. Furthermore today we had some news dripping out on how Goldman is doing, as per bloomberg we heard today that $GS plans to eliminate several hundred roles starting this month, its biggest round of jobs cuts since the start of the pandemic. They also had a prediction on the CPI being :

>We estimate a 0.32% increase in August core CPI (MoM), which would boost the year-on-year rate by two tenths to 6.1%.

and also that $GS, to prepare for layoffs as deal making slows, as per NYT.

All in all it's not any indication at all but for some reason this is giving me a very ""bear Stearns is fiiiiiine"" feel.

# Biden to hit China with broader curbs on U.S. chip and tool exports 

The Biden administration is planning to broaden curbs on U.S shipments to China of semiconductors used for artificial intelligence and chipmaking tools next month, >>>**several people familiar with the matter said**.<<< The Commerce Department intends to publish new regulations based on restrictions communicated in letters earlier this year to three U.S. companies — KLA, Lam Research and Applied Materials, the people said, speaking on the condition of anonymity. The plan for new rules has not been previously reported. The letters, which the companies publicly acknowledged, forbade them from exporting chipmaking equipment to Chinese factories that produce advanced semiconductors with sub-14 nanometer processes unless the sellers obtain Commerce Department licenses. The rules would also codify restrictions in Commerce Department letters sent to Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices last month instructing them to halt shipments of several artificial intelligence computing chips to China unless they obtain licenses.

So-called “is informed” letters allow the Commerce Department to bypass lengthy rule-writing processes to put controls in place quickly, but the letters only apply to the companies that receive them. Turning the letters into rules would broaden their reach and could subject other U.S. companies producing similar technology to the restrictions. The regulations could potentially apply to companies trying to challenge Nvidia and AMD’s dominance in artificial intelligence chips. Intel and startups like Cerebras Systems are targeting the same advanced computing markets. Intel said it is closely monitoring the situation, while Cerebras declined to comment.

One source said the rules could also impose license requirements on shipments to China of products that contain the targeted chips. Dell Technologies, Hewlett Packard Enterprise and Super Micro Computer make data center servers that contain Nvidia’s A100 chip. Dell and HPE said they were monitoring the situation, while Super Micro Computer did not respond to a request for comment.

# DOJ Short-Selling Probe Eyes Bets on Amazon, Microsoft and JPMorgan

The U.S Department of Justice has subpoenaed some short sellers for trading information on firms including Amazon.com Inc, Microsoft Corp and JPMorgan Chase & Co, as part of a short-selling probe, Bloomberg News reported on Monday.

The DOJ sent subpoenas over the past few months seeking details on transactions in several blue-chip stocks, according to the report that cited people familiar with the matter.

The DOJ last year also issued subpoenas to dozens of firms, including Citron Research and Muddy Waters Research LLC, as it probes potentially manipulative trading around negative reports on listed companies published by some of their investors.

The U.S. securities regulator has also said it has been considering measures that require big investors to disclose more about short positions, or bets that stocks will fall, and the use of derivatives to speculate on stock moves.

The DOJ, Microsoft, Amazon and JPMorgan did not immediately respond to Reuters' requests for comment.

\-To be fair we have seen probes over and over for the past year and to be honest... I don't expect anything to come off of this, because hell you know yourself right?

# THE CPI DROPPED, AND THE MARKET TOO

Full details:

* US CPI (M/M) Aug: 0.1% (est -0.1%; prev 0.0%)
* US CPI Core (M/M) Aug: 0.6% (est 0.3%; prev 0.3%)
* US CPI (Y/Y) Aug: 8.3% (est 8.1%; prev 8.5%)
* US CPI Core (Y/Y) Aug: 6.3% (est 6.1%; prev 5.9%)

Price increases year-over-year:

Fuel oil: 68.8%

Gasoline: 25.6%

Electricity: 15.8%

Food at home: 13.5%

Transportation: 11.3%

New cars: 10.1%

Overall CPI: 8.3%

Food away from home: 8.0%

Used cars: 7.8%

Shelter: 6.2%

&#x200B;

As always you can see the CPI numbers here and when you match them up with real life sort of stuff it doesn't even come close, used cars have gone up way more, housing and food has become insane but again ""using their method of calculating it"" it comes down to about 8.3%

Inflation rose more than expected in August even as gas prices helped give consumers a little bit of a break, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported Tuesday.

The consumer price index, which tracks a broad swath of goods and services, increased 0.1% for the month and 8.3% over the past year. **>>>Excluding volatile food and energy costs<<<**, CPI rose 0.6% from July and 6.3% from the same month in 2021.

Economists had been expecting headline inflation to fall 0.1% and core to increase 0.3%, according to Dow Jones estimates. The respective year-over-year estimates were 8% and 6%.

This in turn made banks respond because... of course they do.

A soft landing is becoming a more likely outcome for the global economy than a recession, according to strategists at JPMorgan Chase. The avoidance of a global recession, along with moderating inflation and wage pressures among other factors, should continue to provide tailwinds for risky assets, they added in a note. Within equities, the firm favors cyclical stocks, which it said should benefit from the gradual easing of inflation. They also like small-cap stocks and remain bullish on China and emerging-market stocks.

“We maintain that inflation will resolve on its own as distortions fade and that the Fed has over-reacted with 75bps hike. We will likely see a Fed pivot, which is positive for cyclical assets,” they said. The bank’s strategists said economic data and investor positioning were more important factors for the performance of risk assets than hawkish central bank rhetoric. “The data appear to be increasingly supportive of a soft landing (rather than global recession), given moderating inflation and wage pressures, rebounding growth indicators, and stabilizing consumer confidence,” said the bank’s global markets strategy team.

The U.S. consumer-price index is due to be released later Tuesday and economists expect it to show that annual inflation cooled to 8% in August, from 8.5% in July. That would be the second consecutive month of decelerating price growth, and the lowest rate since February. “Our expectation that the global economy will stay out of recession, increasing fiscal stimulus (e.g. China and energy support in Europe), and still very low investor positioning and sentiment should thus continue to provide tailwinds for risky assets, despite the more hawkish central bank rhetoric recently,” they added

inb4 ""trust me bro"", I'm personally not too sure on a soft landing, as we are currently seeing in the world, unless the situation in eastern Europe cools down I personally don't see the economy cool down. even if they bring out numbers that say it's down, if we look at everything going on it's hard to picture it actually going down any time soon as inflated food, gas and housing prices means the economy wont do well... and to be fair at this point.. with quantitative tightening, the housing market and bonds market... yeah I don't see this returning to a bull market soon.

The fact that the CPI is higher than the forecast were also means that we are more than likely going to see a very hawkish FED coming up soon. (ergo Hike Hike HIKE!) and the markets are responding as well as you'd expect

# Schwab, Citadel Securities, Fidelity, Other Wall Street Firms Start Crypto Exchange EDX Markets

This news just broke this afternoon:

Financial heavyweights including Charles Schwab (SCHW), Citadel Securities and Fidelity Investments [announced](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20220913005367/en/) the start of cryptocurrency exchange EDX Markets, the latest evidence Wall Street is forging ahead in digital assets despite the crypto winter.

The exchange will be led by CEO Jamil Nazarali, formerly a senior executive at Citadel Securities, billionaire Ken Griffin's massive trading operation. Other high-profile EDX backers include trading firm Virtu Financial (VIRT) and venture-capital firms Sequoia Capital and Paradigm.

The news follows an announcement last month from BlackRock (BLK), the world's largest asset manager, that it will give its institutional clients [a way to invest into cryptocurrencies](https://www.coindesk.com/business/2022/08/04/blackrock-to-offer-crypto-for-institutional-investors-through-coinbase-prime/).

""Crypto is a $1 trillion global asset class with over 300 million participants and pent-up demand from millions more,"" EDX Markets' board of directors said in a statement. ""Unlocking this demand requires a platform that can meet the needs of both retail traders and institutional investors with high compliance and security standards.""

The firm's trading platform will be provided by the Members Exchange (MEMX), a U.S. stock market owned by a consortium of financial firms including some of EDX's creators.

# GAS GAS GAS

As to no ones surprise this morning Gas oil and everything energy related had it's futures jump up like hell.

As of market open the OIL FUTURES EXTEND GAINS, U.S. CRUDE UP BY $1 A BARREL. and U.S. NATURAL GAS FUTURES EXTEND GAINS, PRICES UP BY 5%.

By looking at the futures, along with the CPI that got released yesterday PLUS the geopolitical issues right now. We are more than likely going to see a winter in which electricity and gas is going to get extremely high, and loads of households will have to grind to make ends meet.

To battle this a lot of countries are currently looking at capping the price for energy related stuff, we even have Olaf Scholz (Germany's chancellor) saying they will implement one. France has also said to introduce a 15% cap for the next year.

Now instead of going full bad news bears on you all there is a silver lining, it could be that the geopolitical situation eases down (which currently has a decent chance of happening) we could start to see more ""normal"" prices come back in next year.

# Gamestop is adding NFT trading cards

So $gme is adding NFT trading cards to loyalty program perks!

The trading cards are for the game ""Gods Unchained"", this marks their latest venture into the NFT market place as Gamestop is transforming into a more digital centric company with a brick and mortar base. this follows the launch of their NFT marketplace in July followed by their announcement of a partnership with FTX this september.

For those who don't know, Gods unchained is a digital trading card game which is built on the Etherium network. This means that people can buy sell and trade their in game assets and actually own their assets. and it's the brainchild of Chris Clay who also worked on ""Magic the gathering"" digital version. and players spent about $74 billion on in game purchases in 2020 alone.

Members of GameStop’s loyalty “PowerUp Rewards Pro” program pay $14.99 a year for perks such as monthly gift cards, cash back rewards and exclusive releases. Those who are existing members as of Sept, 27 will get a code on that date that they can redeem for the NFT trading cards.

(IMAGINE A PICTURE OF ETH HERE, GOOD NOW NFT IT)

# Eth has Merged to make... ETH

So this is something that's been in the making for quite some time. ""THE MERGE"".  
The merge is a change in how Ethereum does business, it used to ""proof of work"" what means that its network was secured by the miners, and as of the merge Ethereum changed to a protocol named ""proof of stake"" which means the network will be secured by it's stakers.

We have seen the merge being postponed time and time again but as of this morning it was a success! and in theory you could equate this to an engine swap with a car. same car yet different under the hood, but as a driver... it's still the same car.

But even so this could be one of the biggest events in the crypto world itself.

So I'll TLDR through this bit because the people who are into crypto will already know whatsup and the people who are not familiar with it don't want an excel sheet worth of data.

in basic terms, they changed from POW to POS, meaning they switched from miners to stakers to validate their networks.

A staker is someone who ""stakes"" (locks in their crypto) for quite some time (this can be for hours up to years and depends from staker to staker). And because of that change it also means that the miners wont get rewards from the network but the stakers will. this will come from something called the ""staking pool"" which can be seen as a savings account with interest.

**Why did ETH switch?**

Vitalik (the creator of eth) already spoke about going to POS in the early years, this in combination with the fact that ETH is deflationary, which means that Eth gets taken out of circulation and by extension it secures a price rising effect. Also another big (important) point is that people kept saying ""CRYPTO USES SO MUCH ENERGY"", well because of this switch that's now a moot point because the validation comes from stakers instead of miners, that means miners wont be rewarded anymore and we could se a 99% reduction in energy consumption.

**But Renny WUT MEAN FOR ME?**

Nothing really, except that the value of eth can fluctuate.

**So now what?**

Well because eth miners wont be making bank anymore (as much as anyone could in this climate right now), they'll most likely try to switch to an alternative coin to mine so they can profit again. however as a holder of crypto this wont affect you guys.

# Esports?

So this is something that has been hyped the entire day, Guild of Guardians (which is a Game built on Immutable X's blockchain) has teamed up with a lot of the big players in the esports sphere. namely Cloud9, Fnatic, NAVI, Ninjas in Pyjamas, NRG, SK Gaming, T1, and Team Liquid

Quick take:

* Guild of Guardians has announced a multi-partnership deal with some of the leading names in eSports.
* The mobile blockchain game wants to onboard millions of eSports fans to web3. 
* The eight eSports teams have a combined following of 6.3 million.

Guild of Guardians has collaborated with some of the leading names in eSports gaming to bring web3 games to the masses. The web3 mobile game has collaborated with Cloud9, Fnatic, NAVI, Ninjas in Pyjamas, NRG, SK Gaming, T1, and Team Liquid to onboard their fans to the blockchain.

# AND THE SHIT SHOW GETS SHITTIER

As of today Netflix released it's trailer for the gamestop mock/documentary. the trailer already sets the tone that the people who invested with gamestop wanted to (AND I QUOTE) ""yolo, lets destroy the economy"".

It's no surprise that with that much journalistic integrity \*cough\* that Netflix's stock has declined 60% YoY, with all their woke shows and bad quality documentaries like this.

Just in case anyone who's not familiar with the Gamestop situation here's a quick TLDR  
Deepfuckingvalue aka DFV aka Roaringkitty found out that gamestop was being underestimated. It was shorted way over the available shares (140% shorted). We (the retail investors) agreed with his thesis and bought in.  
no one ""wants to destroy the economy"", hell loads of people even talked about how horrible this could become, but just like Dr. Burry made money on the crash in 08 the same thing goes for us here.

Dr Burry was not responsible for the people recklessly spending in 08 in regards to Mortgage backed securities, but he still saw it. as we did with Gamestop.

It's also good to see that they have Atobit in there so we'll have some good information and a decently educated person on the subject, but at the same time they have idiots like Jim Cramer and Matt Kohrs which gives you an idea of what kind of people they think is good.  
(for a little background, Matt got kicked out of the GME community really early for his grifting).

you can watch the trailer here yourself:

#  WHO WATCHES THE WATCHMAN

The SEC official charged with helping the public navigate the agency's complex system lied to investigators and misled Congress, probe alleges. 

Former SEC Ombudsman Misled Congress and IG, Probe Alleges

The SEC official charged with helping the public navigate the agency’s complex system lied to investigators, added misleading information in reports to Congress, and didn’t log hundreds of entries into the agency’s tip program, according to an Inspector General investigation.

The [investigative summary](https://www.sec.gov/files/findings-related-former-sec-ombudsman.pdf), dated August 29, found that the Securities and Exchange Commission’s ombudsman told about 300 investors to file fraud claims on their own, instead of personally logging them into the agency’s internal tip program, as required. When confronted in 2021, the ombudsman created a spreadsheet that falsely claimed tips generated by others were done by her office, the report said. The problems surfaced during a 2021 Inspector General audit of the SEC’S tips, complaints and referrals program (TCR), according to the investigative summary.

“We found that the former Ombudsman misrepresented facts in a written response to an OIG draft management letter related to TCR practices,” the report found. “The former Ombudsman’s written response to the OIG letter was in direct contravention to what the former Ombudsman conveyed to the OIG,” during its review of the TCR program.

The Inspector General’s Office, the SEC and the Office of the Ombudsman didn’t return messages seeking comment.

The office “presented vignettes in the Ombudsman’s Annual Reports to the Congress that were potentially misleading,” according to the summary. It added that the 2021 annual report has been amended to reflect that the incidents cited were composites and may not have actually happened.  


The report doesn’t name the former ombudsman but it points directly to portions of annual reports between 2017 and 2021 that were prepared by Tracey L. McNeil, the agency’s first ombudsman. McNeil was appointed in 2014 and left the SEC in April.

McNeil couldn’t be reached for comment.

The allegations stem from inspector general audits of the TCR program and of the Office of Investor Education and Advocacy, according to a May 24, 2021 letter from former Inspector General Carl Hoecker to SEC Chairman Gary Gensler obtained by Bloomberg Law.

Those audits included interviews with the ombudsman and a review of contributions over years of OIEA reports. The ombudsman’s office serves as a point of contact for hundreds of investors each year who want to report fraud or need help understanding which section of the SEC could provide assistance.

In 2020, the ombudsman received more than 300 direct reports of possible fraud or securities violations, which under agency rules had to be reported to the TCR program. Instead, the ombudsman told nearly all of the callers to file the tips on their own and didn’t fill out the forms internally as required, the IG’s report found.

""(W)e were unable to reconcile the large disparity between the number of matters received and reported by the Ombudsman in FY 2020 as potential securities law violations/fraud, and the number of TCRs the Ombudsman filed,” Hoecker wrote in his 2021 letter to Gensler.

Confronted by investigators, the ombudsman created a spreadsheet containing 14 cases that were said to follow agency rules. In reality, the IG said, the document was false and included 10 tips that had nothing to do with the office, according to the investigative summary.

The Tips, Complaints and Referrals program is the heart of the SEC’s enforcement efforts, and encompasses both reports to the agency’s whistleblower office and to others in the enforcement office. The SEC fields tens of thousands of tips annually, virtually all of which must be put into the system, the IG’s office wrote in 2021.

The goal is to make sure that tips on large frauds don’t slip through the cracks, as happened with consumer complaints about Bernie Madoff, R. Allen Stanford and others.

A Bloomberg review of the ombudsman’s contributions to annual and quarterly reports found that the official’s own written vignettes show those guidelines weren’t followed. For example, the 2020 “Report on Activities” of the office says a “retail investor in Europe” gave information about an “advance fee fraud.”

But the ombudsman never filed a TCR, according to that report.

“The Ombudsman provided the investor with links to guidance on advance fee fraud available on SEC.gov, and recommended that he both contact OIEA for additional resources and assistance and submit a TCR to Enforcement,” the report states.

The official “also suggested that the investor refrain from sending any funds and that he consider consulting private counsel for further advice.”

(ran into the image limit so just imagine a NVIDIA image here)

# EVGA to stop partnership with NVIDIA.

Alright lets start with the source, It's from a video of [Gamer Nexus](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cV9QES-FUAM).

This is from their video but I do trust them to be a reliable source, EVGA said it's to stop it's partnership effective immediately as they cite disrespectful treatment.

This comes in the wake of the ""chip embargo"" Nvidia is facing when it comes to exporting higher quality chips (ai chips etc) to china and russia. EVGA is a really big household name so this is quite a blow to Nvidia (imo).

When asked why they left EVGA answered that it was about respect. It was not a financial decision but rather one of principle. they usually get left in the dark on MSRP prices up to the point where the nvidia ceo is on stage.

the situation as it is, is extremely complex but EVGA is in the right IMO, but make up your own mind and take a look at the video.

Also do note that EVGA does not have a publicly traded stock, but this news could in theory affect Nvidia's stock. As always the negative news comes on friday so it doesn't affect the stock as much. if there will be any affect we'll see it in AH or early next week.

EVGA is not planning on letting people go, as they already had some layoffs happen earlier in the year.

"Environmentalist are attacking BTC and other PoW coins, SEC is grinding PoS coins since the Merge. Is Any Coin Left?","As we all know, Ethereum recently transitioned to proof-of-stake to become more environmental friendly.

Hours after this transition, SEC's Gary Gensler gave a statement that Ethereum under PoS may trigger securities law and can be included as security.

Bunch of articles related to that get posted on this sub in last few hours. You may have read it.

And then Environmental organization like EWG started protesting to change the Bitcoin code and demanding transition of BTC network to PoS.

Seems like, crypto will will get attacked both sides, whether it is PoW or PoS.

What do you think? How can we tackle this situation as a community?",203.0,2022-09-16 12:46:17,0.78
Ethereum (ETH) lost 12% of its value after The Merge,"Why is The Merge successful but the price is falling, should I buy dip ETH, ETC and RBIF now?*📷*",260.0,2022-09-16 10:58:50,0.87
NOTE ON PROFITABILITY AND GPU MINING: PLEASE READ!,"In order to answer the many comments and questions surrounding profitability and what happened to GPU mining, we'd like to point out the following:

1. Ethereum is no longer minable. If you are GPU mining at NiceHash you are getting paid in Bitcoin but **you are not mining Bitcoin**. Buyers buy your hashpower with Bitcoin to mine other cryptocurrencies, the most profitable of which was Ethereum before it stopped being mined yesterday.
2. There are many GPU mineable coins, and although Ethereum was by far the biggest, there are plenty of projects to mine. **GPU mining is not dead!** Many miners have already switched to Ergo, Ethereum Classic, Ravencoin, Flux, and many others. You can use NiceHash Miner to auto switch between these.
3. **It is completely normal for profitability to drop at this time!** NiceHash is a hashpower marketplace, up until recently buyers were placing big orders for mining Ethereum - therefore keeping profits good for miners. Now, there are no orders for mining Ethereum, so only orders on other coins are active. This means there is less Bitcoin being paid, therefore less profits.
4. **Mining is a cycle**. The more miners join a network, the more the difficulty goes up, the harder it is to mine a block, and therefore lower the payouts *(since it is the same amount spread amongst more people)*. If the value of the coin rises, then the profitability grows in tandem. At first, it is unprofitable for most.
5. Currently millions of miners have switched their rigs towards other projects, resulting in the above situation in 4). However, after some time, the increased usage of other coins will likely push prices up, or some miners will leave the networks and mining will become more profitable again.

So what should you do in the meantime? That depends on you, but if you want to keep mining you have 4 options:

1. **Mine using NiceHash's auto-switching software** \- making sure you are always on the highest payouts. Remember as long as you are in plus after your electric cost, you are still in plus! Or even if you break even you can continue mining, and HODL your coins until they go up.
2. If your costs of electricity are too high, simply switch off and **wait for profitability to rise again** (which it will, patience is king when it comes to crypto). Be patient, play some games that you stopped yourself from playing while profits were high :)
3. **Start ASIC mining**. GPU mining is not the only way to mine, if you have the means to invest and are already familiar with how mining works, why not give it a try?
4. **Wait for NiceHash to do what NiceHash does best**: make mining easy and profitable for as many people as possible. We are launching a whole new way to get into mining that will be a game changer - **CATCH THE BLOCK**. Stay tuned, our new **Solo Mining** concept is on the way!

It's inevitable to have disruption in markets with a huge event such as The Merge taking place, but with crypto, there is only one way to make money. **Patience and perseverance. NiceHash is not going anywhere. We've been here for the mining community since day one, and that's how it will remain.**",99.0,2022-09-16 10:28:10,0.95

But even so this could be one of the biggest events in the crypto world itself.

So I'll TLDR through this bit because the people who are into crypto will already know whatsup and the people who are not familiar with it don't want an excel sheet worth of data.

in basic terms, they changed from POW to POS, meaning they switched from miners to stakers to validate their networks.

A staker is someone who ""stakes"" (locks in their crypto) for quite some time (this can be for hours up to years and depends from staker to staker).  And because of that change it also means that the miners wont get rewards from the network but the stakers will. this will come from something called the ""staking pool"" which can be seen as a savings account with interest.

**Why did ETH switch?**

Vitalik (the creator of eth) already spoke about going to POS in the early years, this in combination with the fact that ETH is deflationary, which means that Eth gets taken out of circulation and by extension it secures a price rising effect. Also another big (important) point is that people kept saying ""CRYPTO USES SO MUCH ENERGY"", well because of this switch that's now a moot point because the validation comes from stakers instead of miners, that means miners wont be rewarded anymore and we could se a 99% reduction in energy consumption.

**But Renny WUT MEAN FOR ME?**

Nothing really, except that the value of eth can fluctuate.

**So now what?**

Well because eth miners wont be making bank anymore (as much as anyone could in this climate right now), they'll most likely try to switch to an alternative coin to mine so they can profit again. however as a holder of crypto this wont affect you guys.

The partners will also leverage [NFT](https://www.nftgators.com/what-is-an-nft/) technology to offer the eSports character to fans as digital collectibles on the proof-of-stake blockchain platform Immutable X.

Commenting on the partnership, Derek Lau, VP & Game Director for Guild of  Guardians said: “GOG is a mobile team RPG which is built for players and designed as a highly  accessible game, making it the perfect gateway into the world of web3 for all players.”

The partnership gives eSports fans more exciting options to support and engage with their favourite teams and players. According to the announcement, fans will be able to represent their teams in-game, using digital assets.

This partnership also gives fans true ownership, allowing them “to create, own, and trade their digital  assets, in addition to competing against others to earn rewards.”

The eight eSports teams have a combined value of about $2 billion according to Forbes with five of them ranking in the top 10 of the most valuable teams.

Pietro Fringuelli, Chairman of the Executive Board of The World Esports Association (WESA) commented: “We’re thrilled to partner with Guild of Guardians in what we believe to be a hugely symbiotic relationship for both our industries – gaming and esports. We firmly believe that eSport brand  integration into games is the future, enabling closer interactions between fans and teams.”

Fringuelli said he was particularly excited by the “notion of digital ownership and the ability to earn and trade in-game  characters.”

# THEYRE GOING AFTER OUR STASH YO!

Adderall, the widely used drug for attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, is experiencing shortages across the US, according to interviews with patients as well as major pharmacy chains that carry the pills.

Bloomberg spoke to half a dozen patients in states including California, Indiana and Michigan who said that they called or went into CVS Health Corp. or Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc. pharmacies in August or September and were told the medicines were out of stock. In some cases, patients were told they might have to wait more than a week to get their medication, which is supposed to be taken every day.

This is horrible to happen, it's not entirely sure what is currently causing the shortage but no matter where it comes from this is bad. as a lot of people depend on this medication.

* August retail sales come in hotter than expected, 0.3% vs. 0.0% est.
* Quad-witching occurs Friday, options expiration totaling $3+ trillion

Equities are pushing lower today as traders prepare for Fridays quad-witching options expiration. Building on this weeks losses, todays price action in equities comes following a hot retail sales report in the premarket session. The data this morning was mixed, as August retail sales came in hot but Julys print was revised considerably lower. Markets still remain in limbo following this weeks CPI report, as traders question the possibility of a 100 basis point rate hike from the Federal Reserve next week. Treasury yields have been on a tear as market participants continue to reprice Fed expectations, with the 2-year yield reaching 3.86% today

# AND THE SHIT SHOW GETS SHITTIER

As of today Netflix released it's trailer for the gamestop mock/documentary. the trailer already sets the tone that the people who invested with gamestop wanted to (AND I QUOTE) ""yolo, lets destroy the economy"".

It's no surprise that with that much journalistic integrity \*cough\* that Netflix's stock has declined 60% YoY, with all their woke shows and bad quality documentaries like this.

Just in case anyone who's not familiar with the Gamestop situation here's a quick TLDR  
Deepfuckingvalue aka DFV aka Roaringkitty found out that gamestop was being underestimated. It was shorted way over the available shares (140% shorted). We (the retail investors) agreed with his thesis and bought in.  
no one ""wants to destroy the economy"", hell loads of people even talked about how horrible this could become, but just like Dr. Burry made money on the crash in 08 the same thing goes for us here.

Dr Burry was not responsible for the people recklessly spending in 08 in regards to Mortgage backed securities, but he still saw it. as we did with Gamestop.

It's also good to see that they have Atobit in there so we'll have some good information and a decently educated person on the subject, but at the same time they have idiots like Jim Cramer and Matt Kohrs which gives you an idea of what kind of people they think is good.  
(for a little background, Matt got kicked out of the GME community really early for his grifting).

you can watch the trailer here yourself:

This sub is on life support but Ethereum has the most institutional attention ever.,"This sub seems like a ghost town lately which is crazy considering the moves ETH has been making lately. I’m honestly extremely bullish long term given the scope of web 3. Now that the merge has happened successfully, I believe there will be a slow price decrease. I think we will see ETH’s price under $1,200 soon.

I’m extremely bullish on ETH long term and think it will change everyday life in 5-10 years once mass adoption happens. Short term I believe the music has stopped and we are heading lower. 

Retail has basically fled from crypto but institutional investment has never been higher. Anyone still here most likely will be fine during the next bull market but given the macroeconomic going on, it doesn’t look bright short term. 

I sold out majority of my eth long ago and have been buying some back but I recently sold out again. I still hold a few eth but have been waiting to jump heavily back in. I believe under $1,200 is fair game to start buying again. What is everyone else’s plan?",97.0,2022-09-15 19:06:13,0.89

Vitalik Buterin’s philosophical essays: they’re not good,"I accidentally wrote an essay on Twitter this morning. Maybe I'll clean it up for a blog post. You can have the raw version.

----

being asked about Vitalik Buterin's essays on the fabulous future of society, powered by Ethereum.

so it's not worth treating Buterin's essays as saying anything useful.

ethereum is best understood as a tech startup that succeeded wildly and made a bundle for everyone involved. mostly joe lubin.

vitalik is joe's front man, a magical boy wizard beyond mortal ken.

look at this bilge from 2016, it is 100% marketing vitalik as the mysterious infantilised child with a great brain https://www.wired.com/2016/06/the-uncanny-mind-that-built-ethereum/

buterin comes up with all these essays full of great thoughts on how to reorganise the world, and how ethereum will have amazing new facilities added to it that only require P=NP.

and it's all nonsense, too much LessWrong, Thiel and Balaji.

Ethereum makes more sense if you first assume it never mattered if the fancy promises ever worked out - even if Buterin believed they were supposed to. The purpose was to sell you their ether. And it worked.

the fancy promises, the essays, the wild ideas that sound like they're stupid but Buterin's marketed as a super smart boy wizard so they must have *something* to them surely ... it's all marketing

people read buterin's social essays then have to bridge the gap between the assumption that all of this *must* make coherent sense because it was written by an acknowledged genius boy, and the undeniable fact that the stuff in front of you looks ... stupid

*taps the sign again* https://davidgerard.co.uk/blockchain/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/bitcoin-it-cant-be-that-stupid.png

buterin's essays are amazing science fictional ideas, but they aren't real life. they’re a marketing scheme for ether.

buterin comes from a long silicon valley tradition of SV very smart boys who have had it hammered into them that domain expertise, i.e. actually knowing shit, pales into insignificance compared to pulling ideas out of your backside by virtue of your superior intelligence

buterin was taught this by other SV very smart boys who were taught that domain expertise pales into insignificance compared to pulling ideas out of your backside by virtue of your superior intelligence.

thiel literally paid buterin not to go to college, based on this theory

buterin is an interesting writer but he also spent *years* working on an ethereum plan that only required things that he would have learnt were almost certainly impossible (requiring P=NP) had thiel not paid him not to do Intro to Theory of Computation.

and none of that matters, because buterin and the ethereum crew are set up for life after the stupendously successful tech startup called ethereum, and are much richer than you or i are.

but i would suggest that this is not a reason to take any of the essays seriously.

[tech note: when a program design hits a P=NP, you can pretty much always approximate a 99% solution. or n is small or whatever. but when it's cryptography, about *money*, approximate solutions are generally a very bad and exploitable idea. you should be aiming for mathematical robustness.]

dumbfucks are still saying that the Merge means Ethereum will be faster with lower gas fees. literally the fucking Ethereum Foundation says neither of these is true.

they hope they will be in the future, just as soon as they solve P=NP and all win Fields medals

ethereum is an application platform for running penny stock scams denominated natively in ETH. if those keep on working, all is well. that's all the ecosystem cares about.

hell, the users don't even care about decentralisation, or nobody would use Binance Smart Chain.

buterin's essays posit ethereum as the technological foundation of all our lives. this will never happen, because blockchains don't scale.

vitalik touts decentralized governance - based on ethereum - because he has spent his entire life steeped in anarchocapitalism and thinks of it as normal.

the best source for the current thinking of this cluster of chucklefucks on ""decentralised governance"" is vitalik's friend balaji, who's written a whole book on this just recently. The Network State it's fucking awful and you need a decoder ring to understand it.

The Network State tl;dr:

1. what if seasteading
2. on the blockchain
3. also we're all neoreactionaries and scientific racists and we want our blockchain seasteads to have Kings

available wherever stupendously bad books are pirated

I must stress that I am delighted they finally got PoS out the door. everything else about crypto is still bad - it's quilted from scams, its only use case is dodging the law, the politics are horrible and the users are crooks - but it won't use a country's worth of electricity.

buterin's essays have slightly less redigested LessWrong these days, so that's less bad

his pet cranks are no longer embarrassing mathematical cranks https://davidgerard.co.uk/blockchain/buterins-quantum-quest/

buterin's pet cranks are now social cranks, e.g. Glen Weyl, with his Radical Markets theory that's just Georgism with a concussion 

and then Weyl and Buterin's Soul Tokens essay, which is *literally* Black Mirror ""15 Million Merits"" except they think it's good. Also they crib from Balaji on “cancel culture.” https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4105763

Weyl and Buterin's stuff is crank economics and crank social theories straight from the California Ideology with little to no reference to anything actual people think.

the job should surely not be to propose new iterations of the Torment Nexus and say they're a good idea.

buterin has spent his life being told he's smart and has important ideas. he is very smart and a genuinely good guy. i have not encountered anyone with a bad word to say about buterin as a person.

but i am deeply unconvinced any of the ideas in Buterin's essays are worth anything, because they're concocted without reference to anything that people who aren't weird crypto ancaps want.

they're mapping out tech dystopias and thinking they're architecting heaven. they are not.

Buterin's essays are science fiction advocating a particular *politics*. this is not about technology. it never was.

even ethereum was never about technology. blockchain tech isn't that complicated. the fancy stuff is *financial* engineering, not software engineering. always was

by all accounts, Buterin is a completely sincere and good guy. all of this is with the best of intent.

but there's no reason for anyone to put any store by the ideas, and there never was. Ethereum is a tech startup that made a bundle and has really dubious politics attached.

smart people need the ghost of Socrates to follow them around as a Memento Stultus. ""Remember: you too are a dumbass.""

What’s going on with the Ethereum Merge?,"Recently, I’ve seen a lot of posts talking about The Merge [such as this post here,](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/xepklr/the_merge_is_now_live_on_the_ethereum_mainnet_one/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf) an event which will supposedly create massive change of epic proportions across the Ethereum world. In particular, I read comments saying that it would make mining Ethereum impossible/impractical leaving a ripple effect not just within Ethereum but also in its satellite spaces like hardware, where graphics cards were once super valuable for their use in crypto mining. 

I don’t exactly have a background in cryptocurrency beyond being a casual outside observer, and I don’t plan on doing anything with crypto anytime soon. But I’m curious. What is The Merge? Is it a deliberate decision made by some authoritative body, or a consequence of the way Ethereum has evolved over time? What exactly is merging? How does it break down the utility of mining Ethereum? Will/have other cryptocurrencies experience(d) their own versions of The Merge?",387.0,2022-09-15 10:43:14,0.93

Gamestop is the trojan horse betting on Cryptos mainstream adoption and has been waiting on the merge to make moves.,"I realize this is as tinfoily as it gets but there are some coincidences stacking up that make me think this is at least a possibility. Cohen is obsessed with long term share holder value and delighting customers to achieve that end and he is about have a huge new base of customers participating in their marketplace. IMX is beginning to launch games in coming days/ weeks with at least 2 triple AAA studios coming on bears and 1 of those being playable in the next 6 months. These games will all have their own micro economies where users will generate and trade real value assets in the form of LRC and IMX (so far) both operating on ETH.

Gaming is a growing industry and it is very likely crypto will be in some form in the medium and long term. They have a symbiotic relationship where as one increases it brings more value to the other. Cohens vision for transforming the company has made the very intentional decision pioneer into the crypto space with gaming to an existing userbase of more than 50 million. Using LRC and IMX (so far) both operate on Ethereum and incentivizes holding either ETH or tokenized securities and economies operating on ETH.

 If participating in these ecosystems creates more value, more people are going to flow into both overtime. Users will be financially rewarded for participation in the system as they play and create (power to the players, power to the creators). Gaming and GME may be the trojan horse to crypto going mainstream and taking a larger and larger slice of the pie from traditional finance over time.  Getting actually paid for **fucking** **gaming** (what a time to be alive, am I right). On top of that Loopring has a patent on a de-fi exchange that:

""[relates to the use of stable value digital assets and/or fiat-backed digital assets as cryptocurrencies that can be linked to other digital assets using blockchain technology](https://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO2&Sect2=HITOFF&p=1&u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsearch-bool.html&r=2&f=G&l=50&co1=AND&d=PTXT&s1=Loopring&OS=Loopring&RS=Loopring) "".

 Oh, and they just partnered with  FTX a crypto derivatives exchange. Does this not jack your tits!

The most pressing hurdles facing cryptos widespread adoption imo have been:

1. Cost to environment (Solved with merge - ETH went from causing 2% of the worlds global electricity to less than 0.001 percent as of today)
2. Difficulty to use (Solved with the ongoing launch of GME marketplace/ crypto as they handle everything on the backend and incorporate to mere clicks away from their traditional web 2 digital stores.
3. Utility (Gamestop and partners not only bringing digital ownership of assets to the masses through gaming economies and securities in the near future, but all operating on t+0 with real price discovery).

If GME is betting on crypto and especially Ethereum they have placed themselves in as one of a few unique companies at the spear head of cryptos rise and mass adoption.

As an added coincidence Matt Finestone, now former head of GME blockchain said just days ago as he exited the company :

""[I will always care deeply about this project, and will cherish watching it advance.  I plan to continue working within the Ethereum ecosystem, and return closer to the protocol/infrastructure level. There's never been a more exciting time to be an Etherean.""](https://twitter.com/finestonematt/status/1569316436354506752)

Now, just after the merge, he tweets out 

[""Ethereum is the most exciting phenomenon on the planet, and is just getting started.""](https://twitter.com/finestonematt/status/1570313498630012930)

Matt has been instrumental in the development of Loopring and Gamestop's NFT marketplace, and I doubt he intends to his prior creations and contributions go to waste. It is incredibly bullish that he has left right as both the merge and GME begin to rollout the gaming side of their launch.

The merge has happened. Here's what not to do now.,"**The merge kicked in about 1.5 hours ago** (around 11:40pm PDT September 14). 

The eth stratum servers were shut down a few minutes later. 

**There is no more ethereum mining at Flexpool now**, only Ethereum Classic, Zilliqa, and Chia for now. No announcements of other coins at this time. 

**Your unpaid ETH balances are safe** and will be **maintained for 3 months from the Merge**. 

If you need your settings changed, **please wait a few days** and then put in a ticket with your coin, wallet address, and requested changes. 

**The minimum payouts have not changed.** They might in a few days, stay tuned for news of that if/when it happens. For now it's still 0.01 for ETH mainnet and 0.005 for Polygon WETH. 

We expect an enormous burst of tickets this week and next as former miners realize Ethereum is no longer mineable. In the hour after the merge, we got as many tickets as on some whole days last month. So your patience and restraint are appreciated.

Diamantenhände 💎👐 German market is open 🇩🇪,"Guten Morgen to this global band of Apes! 👋🦍

This sub has certainly had an uptick in attempts to divide the community, has it not?
From suggesting that there is low engagement to complaining about DRS posts drowning out DD, the goal seems to be to plant seeds of doubt in minds.
Of course, this is classic FUD.
That it comes at this time, when the SHFs seem to be so vulnerable has me incredibly excited for the days ahead.

With the Ethereum merge in just a few minutes, we are at the cusp of a significant change to how the world interacts with crypto.
We've seen many companies float the idea of using NFTs in products, only to retreat from the backlash of users concerned about the environmental impact of proof-of-work systems.
While GameStop is among several companies who mitigate this by using L2, the fact that one of the largest systems is moving to proof-of-stake will bring a shift of public sentiment along with it.
This is a huge moment in the company's digital future, and they already have many of the necessary pieces in place to drive massive growth.

Meanwhile, Citadel is putting anything they can find up as collateral so they can survive another day.
HODLing GME is the easiest thing I do each day.

Today is Thursday, September 15th, and you know what that means! Join other apes around the world to watch infrequent updates from the German markets!

ETH Post Merge Supply & Inflation Economics 101,"In celebration of the merge, I want go give a little back to the community in the form of an economics lesson. I will try to clear up some common misunderstandings about the economics of ethereum’s ether (ETH) supply by comparing it to the United States Dollar (USD).

A very common economics mistake in the crypto community is comparing the USD inflation rate to the yearly rate of change for ETH supply. You are comparing two different completely different metrics.

Most people are familiar with the official USD consumer price index (CPI) yearly rate of change, currently at 8.3%. The CPI is commonly referred to as the inflation rate. The inflation rate measures the rate that the USD is losing value per year by tracking the cost items that the average American spends their money on including rent, cars, gas, food, and more. There is no government that is tracking the ETH CPI inflation rate. If you were to track the inflation rate for ETH, the rate would swing wildly between massive deflation and massive inflation based on the movements of the ether price in USD.

The monetary supply of USD has been growing much faster than CPI inflation rate. The most used measurement of the USD money supply is the M2 (M2SL). Over the last 10 years, the USD M2 money supply has grown an average of 8.6% per year, with 2020 and 2021 coming in at 25% and 12%!

Over the past year, ETH's money supply growth has fluctuated between a yearly rate of around 2 to 4%. After the merge, the ETH money supply will grow at a maximum of 0.5% per year, but the supply could actually decrease by 1 to 2% per year, or more, if demand to use ethereum increases. So based on the monetary supply difference alone, you could expect ethereum to go up in value around 9% per year compared to the USD.

Validators who are staking their ETH can expect to earn between 4 to 15% yearly yield on their Ethereum. Taking a conservative estimate of 6%, and adding in a supply growth difference of 9% per year, gives you a 15% yearly yield compared to holding USD. This is not accounting for the logarithmic growth that often occurs for increasing network effects.

Finally, staking withdrawals are not enabled after the merge until a future upgrade in released in 6-12 months. Since no new supply of ETH will be available for sale, this guarantees ETH will be deflationary until after the merge until the upgrade is released.

My estimated default yield for ETH measured in USD: 8 to 9% per year

My estimated default yield for staked ETH measured in USD: 12 to 25% per year

# [The Merge](https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/e1bf63ec3d6006cbcc71b58b3c08d8d8c3786fc2/2d49c/static/af4c7b859f61f1d95498d205b015b1c3/ddc81/energy.png)

Per chi stia continuando a leggere ma magari non stia dietro a queste notizie, cos'è il Merge? Cosa succederà in breve e perché dovrebbe interessarvi?

Ethereum è una delle più famose cryptovalute dopo Bitcoin, col secondo marketcap. Da anni progettano di migrare la blockchain da ""proof of work"" a ""proof of stake"" (PoS). Proof of work (PoW) si riferisce al modo in cui, per farla breve, vengono ""prodotti"" o minati ""nuovi"" blocchi di Ethereum, risolvendo un algoritmo di hash. A differenza di Bitcoin, Ethereum è ancora possibile minarlo con le GPU, una delle cause per cui sono arrivate a costare tantissimo nel passato recente.

All'incirca [stanotte o domani mattina](https://watcher.guru/ethmerge), la rete Ethereum diventerà ""proof of stake"". Ovvero dei ""validatori"" si prenderanno il compito di validare le transazioni e generare nuovi blocchi. Se vi interessa il punto di vista tecnico, la pagina della fondazione Ethereum lo spiega. Lo staking consiste nel ""delegare"" i vostri coin ad un validator, che li semplicemente blocca, come se fosse un conto deposito vincolato. Col passare del tempo riceverete anche una certa % di nuovi eth a seconda del vostro deposito.

In sostanza stanotte, come schioccando le dita, migliaia di GPU sparse in giro per il mondo smetteranno di minare e andranno off-line. Questo comporterà una sensibile e significativa riduzione del consumo di elettricità a livello globale della rete Ethereum, del 99.95% [secondo le statistiche di ethereum.](https://ethereum.org/en/energy-consumption/) - se tutti si sposteranno su Eth PoS. Il grafico indica come Eth PoW consumi quanto la metà dell'energia spesa da Youtube (o dall'estrazione dell'oro). Eth PoS idealmente solo 0.01 TWh/y invece di 112 TWh/y, stando ai loro dati.

Qualche FAQ:

* **E' la fine del mining di cryptovalute?**

No il mining di cryptovalute non finirà definitivamente né per sempre. Bitcoin rimane Proof of Work, ma non è possibile minarlo con le GPU ma ci vogliono delle macchine specifiche chiamate ASIC. Sicuramente qualcuno si sposterà su altri coin da minare, ma dato che finora Etherem l'ha fatta da padrone, tutte le altre coin da sole non potrebbero assorbire più che il 5% dei ""minatori"". Il che significa che chi non ha l'elettricità gratis o molto economica finirà per perderci. Se vi interessa, su /r/EtherMining si discute (ogni giorno) di cosa fare dopo. 

* **Sono un no-coiner, che vantaggi ci saranno per me?**

L'effetto più materiale, oltre al minor consumo a livello globale, sarà quello della svendita delle GPU di chi ha deciso di smettere. Cosa che già era in progresso per via del mercato bear, ma che è aumentata in quest'ultimo periodo. Da domani, sicuramente altri decideranno di appendere la GPU al chiodo.

* **Sono un crypto-bro, che vantaggi ci saranno per me?**

E' un evento abbastanza discusso, più volte rimandato. Quindi è probabile ci sarà tanta volatilità e speculazione. Magari commetteranno un errore ""in produzione"" madornale che finirà per affondare Ethereum dando un colpo fatale al mondo crypto. Lo sapremo domani mattina. Già alcune delle potenziali crypto che potrebbero sostituire ETH sono aumentate di valore. Ethereum Classic (ma questa è un'altra storia), RavenCoin, Ergo, etc.

Se avete degli ETH in staking su un exchange, questi non saranno ancora prelevabili da domani. Bisognerà aspettare un futuro upgrade che avverrà fra qualche mese.

* **E' un evento totalmente positivo?**

Per l'ambiente sicuramente. C'è però una visione discordante. Ovvero, consumi a parte, l'idea che chiunque possa minare col proprio PC è l'equivaelnte ""romantico"" della tanta agognata decentralizzazione. Per diventare ""validator"" è necessario avere minimo 32 ETH, ai prezzi di oggi circa 50.000€. Sarà sicuramente possibile partecipare anche con uno 0.0001 ETH in qualche pool, però ciò per certi versi concentrerà comunque il potere in meno mani di prima. Che poi, Ethereum ha una ""fondazione"" dietro. Parere personale mio è che già non sia poi così decentralizzata.

Inoltre, pare che gruppi di minatori ""ribelli"" non passeranno ad Eth PoS, ma non facendo ciò istanzieranno una ""fork"" di Eth PoW per continuare a minare. Se avete Eth, vi troverete anche con degli Eth PoW ""nuovi"", il cui valore sarà da determinare a seconda di quanto decideranno i maggiori exchange (se trattarlo insomma).

Quindi insomma, occhio all'orologio. Line goes up or line goes down? Sicuramente line goes right.

# What is The Merge?

Right now Ethereum uses a Proof of Work consensus protocol, similar to Bitcoin, that allows all the different nodes to agree on the state of the network (basically, who has how much ETH). For many reasons including security, environmental-concerns, and scalability, Ethereum is moving to Proof of Stake. This transition from PoW to PoS is what is called ""the Merge.""

&#x200B;

>The Merge is the most significant upgrade in the history of Ethereum [^(1)](https://ethereum.org/en/upgrades/merge/#what-is-the-merge) The Merge represents the joining of the existing execution layer of Ethereum (the Mainnet we use today) with its new proof-of-stake consensus layer, the Beacon Chain. It eliminates the need for energy-intensive mining and instead secures the network using staked ETH. A truly exciting step in realizing the Ethereum vision – more scalability, security, and sustainability [^(1)](https://ethereum.org/en/upgrades/merge/#what-is-the-merge)

**TLDR: Ethereum is upgrading from** [**Proof of Work**](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/consensus-mechanisms/pow/) **consensus mechanism to** [**Proof of Stake**](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/consensus-mechanisms/pos)**. This is big!**

# Do I Need to Do Anything?

Absolutely not! The upgrade process is under-the-hood and does not need any input from you. Please be alert, there will be scammers trying to capitalize on any confusion during this process.

&#x200B;

>You do not need to do anything to protect your funds entering The Merge. *This bears repeating*: As a user or holder of ETH or any other digital asset on Ethereum, as well as non-node-operating stakers, you do not need to do anything with your funds or wallet before The Merge.

# Does the Merge fix gas prices?

Ethereum network fees are based on supply and demand, when the network has a lot of activity, gas prices can be really high. Unfortunately, the Merge was not really intended to reduce the costs...but hey have you tried L2s like [Optimism](https://twitter.com/optimismFND), [Arbitrum](https://twitter.com/arbitrum), and [Loopring](https://twitter.com/loopringorg) or sidechains like [Polygon](https://twitter.com/0xPolygon) and [Gnosis](https://twitter.com/gnosischain).

# Can I withdraw my staked ETH after the Merge?

Staked ETH and staking rewards will remain locked following the Merge. We will have to wait for the next upgrade for that! But many of the pooled staking clients like [RocketPool](https://rocketpool.net), [Lido](https://lido.fi), and even exchanges like [Coinbase](https://help.coinbase.com/en/coinbase/trading-and-funding/coinbase-earn/eth-2-0-staking) have liquidity tokens that you can withdraw in place of ETH you have staked in their pools.

&#x200B;

>Staked ETH, staking rewards to date, and newly issued ETH immediately after The Merge will still be locked on the Beacon Chain without the ability to withdraw. Withdrawals are planned for the Shanghai upgrade, the next major upgrade following The Merge. This means that newly issued ETH, though accumulating on the Beacon Chain, will remain locked and illiquid for at least 6-12 months following The Merge.

# What is ETHPoW and what are the Risks?

Some miners are planning to continue to mine on a forked Ethereum proof-of-work chain, called EthPoW. After the Merge, the balances on the Ethereum PoS chain would be duplicated on the PoW chain. However, there are major risks in interacting with these ""airdropped"" tokens.

&#x200B;

**‼️ WARNING**

>Unless the miners are able to coordinate before the Merge to create and all agree to run their own new PoW-only release of the Geth client, with a new chain ID, it will be possible to ""replay"" transactions made on one side of the fork, onto the other one. Anyone can do this to your transactions, at zero cost to themselves.

Are you all investing in NFTs on GameStop's marketplace? Seems like you are leaving me a lot of spectacular deals...,"There is some really impressive art on here, including NFTs that are sold as 1/1 editions. I hope you realize that this is our chance to actually get in on valuable digital items very early at basement introductory prices. It's a big week with the ethereum merge and GameStop's CollectFest. Who knows how long you'll have to get some of this stuff before it explodes in value.

When the marketplace gets out of beta, some of these NFTs are likely to be worth much much more.

Ethereums Merge - PoS vs PoW and the most common misconceptions,"
I thought I would clear up some of the most common misconceptions about PoS. I'll basically make this a two piece explanatory, first I'll compare PoW and PoS and go into some details, then I'll answer some of those common misconceptions below. So you have the option to just see my answers below or read the entire thing and understand why I answered the questions like I answered them.

# Understanding

## What's the difference between PoW and PoS?

Both systems are intended to form consensus on the current state of the chain. Basically in a decentral project you have to come to some kind of consensus on things. Who gets to include transactions, what is the absolute order of transactions on the chain to make sure one coin is not spent double, which chain is the legitimate one and which one is the attacker chain. So these consensus frameworks lay down the rules that everyone who wants to participate have to follow.

### PoW

In PoW this is done via computing power and energy. A computer that finds a solution to a very difficult mathematical problem first has the ability to create a block, include a bunch of transactions in it, secure the chain and its history. And of course profit from it in the form of a reward, some crypto currency for finding the block called ""block reward"" and the transaction fees for those transactions included in your block. The mathematical problem is so hard to solve, that the best known way to solve it is just guessing it (while it's hard to solve, it's super easy to verify if your solution is correct). That's what mining basically is, using a ton of electricity and hardware to guess a solution to a really hard problem that has no other use than securing the chain.

So in order to participate in PoW you need a lot of graphic cards or even better - specialized hardware called ASICs (ASIC companies is another whole new topic, I just like to mention that they usually ""test"" their hardware thoroughly before they send it to their customers months later. You can't really produce your own ASICs which is why there's a constant call to open source these blueprints and which is why a lot of other crypto currencies chose mining algorithms that are ASIC resistant to strengthen their projects decentralization). These things cost real world money, need electricity and lots of it, need a space to put them, produce heat and wear down or brick over time. Ideally you want to mine somewhere where electricity and cooling is cheap.

On average a block is found every 13 seconds and earns you 2 ETH + transaction fees. Now when more miners with more hardware join, blocks would be found much quicker than those 13s average, so we introduce something called the ""difficulty"" that adjusts the work that a computer has to perform so we are back to an average block creation of 13s. Basically if more miners start mining, it becomes more difficult for everyone else. So in order to keep your current influence on the chain and your current reward level, you'd have to reinvest in more hardware.

The protocol dictates that you always follow the chain with the most work put into it, so if you decide to attack PoW you need at least 51% of the networks computing power to pull of an ""51% attack"". While this attack does not allow you to spend money that isn't yours, this attack does allow you to revert the chain’s history. To give you an idea, you could sell 1000 ETH for dollars and and then just revert your transaction and have both your initial 1000 ETH as well as the dollars you earned from the sell.

So in short: Money translates to hardware and electricity. Translates to rewards and influence.

### PoS

Now in PoS we have a system where you don't need hardware or specialized devices, only an ordinary computer and ETH. ETH is still paid with real world money so both systems ultimately depend on money. Instead of needing fiat money to buy mining equipment and electricity, you need fiat money to buy ETH. So the two systems are very similar in these regards, PoS just cuts out the middle man of having to buy computing power.

A stake of 32 ETH makes you a so called ""validator"". Instead of solving a complicated problem, in PoS a random random validator is chosen to be the block creator every 12 seconds (randomness on a decentral system is a really interesting topic, so if you are intrigued by this you can learn more here: https://eth2.incessant.ink/book/06__building-blocks/02__randomness.html#enter-randao). Note that while in PoW this was on average 13s (there could be 8 blocks in a minute and then just 1 block in a minute), PoS works like a clockwork where a new block is due exactly every 12 seconds. While the block creator earns the block reward and transaction fees like in PoW, those rewards are significantly lower. Right now you'd get just 0.02882 ETH per block instead of 2 ETH in PoW. But the validator has more duties than just blocks. 32 blocks are whats called an Epoch. Every epoch your validator is assigned a random block to attest to. Attesting basically means checking the block and their proposer for validity and signing of with a mathematical signature. You can think of it as basically vouching with your 32 ETH stake that this block of someone else is correct and the proposer followed all the rules laid out by the protocol. You earn some 0.00001 ETH ETH per attestation. Currently a validator makes around 0.1 ETH per month, which is way less of what you'd be making if you spend 32 ETH on mining hardware and start mining with it.

But since your expenses have been cut down significantly compared to PoW (remember no heavy electricity consuming devices, no need for cooling or even big physical spaces, no real wear over time except maybe your SSD, you could basically run multiple validators on one single computer that is less powerful than your phone from 4 years ago) those lower rewards actually make a lot of sense.

Since we learned that a validator has duties every epoch (and an epoch happens every 6.4 minutes), your validator has to be online a lot though. Missing one of these duties during downtime will get you penalized. Now those penalties are very low though. You roughly loose the amount of ETH you would have earned in this epoch. So if an attestation earns you 0.00001 ETH, you'd loose 0.00001 ETH if you missed one. As long as you are online for more than 50% of the time, you'll turn a profit.

Since block times on PoS are fixed at 12s and the proposer is chosen at random, the difficulty system like we saw in PoW is not really needed here. But you are still competing against other validators in two things:

1) if more validators join, your chance to be chosen for a block proposal shrinks accordingly. And with it your annual return.

2) PoS has an incentive curve. Now what this means is, if Ethereum has too few validators, the rewards for validators increase. If Ethereum has too many validators, the rewards for validators decrease. You want to incentivize enough people to stake to secure the chain, but at the same time at some point the additional security benefit of more validators does not justify a high inflation any more. For example a network that can be attacked for 500,000$ may offer 25% interest per year to incentivize more stakers to join and secure the network, while a network that takes 10 billion dollars to attack does not need to incentivize at such extreme lengths and can reduce the interest to 4% per year and cut inflation for everyone else in return.

So like in PoW, you have protocol level competition with other validators. And in order to stay competitive, you would have to reinvest your earnings and spin up more validators to keep your current influence and reward level.

While this all sounds pretty straight forward so far, it will take more to make PoS work though. The very first generation of PoS coins that came into existence around 2014 suffered from a flaw called ""nothing at stake"" (including the coin that pioneered PoS ""Peercoin""). You see, when you decide to attack the network in PoW and build your own chain to replace the legitimate one, you need at least 51% of the networks computing power to archive this. To reverse a transaction, you'd have to do the work of the last 6 blocks again and build your new chain faster than the one that is being built by the entire rest of the network combined (remember, in PoW we follow the chain with the most work put into them).

But in PoS, since no work is attached to the creation of a block, a validator can simply replace their own last 6 blocks with 6 different blocks in less than a second. This would lower the barrier for 51% attacks extremely since even with 10% you might be the block producer for the last 6 blocks just by pure chance of luck. And if that happens, it costs you nothing to replace the last 6 blocks and attack the chain, which is why the problem is called the ""nothing at stake"" problem.

Modern PoS systems like Ethereum solve this by introducing two simple rules:

1) You cannot sign two conflicting attestations or blocks at the same height

2) You can not signing a block with a source or target that would surround you or get surrounded by another block you made

Since every duty you perform is signed off by you with a mathematical signature that cannot be forged, it's super easy to prove whether you violated this rule or not. You just have to listen to two duties signed off by the same entity for the same slot. That's all it takes for any validator on the chain to include this as proof on the beaconchain that you violated these rules and slash you. Slashing is basically a severe penalty where you end up losing parts or even the full 32 ETH of your stake plus you will be forcefully ejected from the network and can no longer operate as validator. Now if you try to replace the last 6 blocks you created by signing off 6 new blocks, you'll be slashed and lose your ETH and your validator role.

So in short: Money translates to stake. Translates to rewards and influence. Consumes 99,8% less energy. Bad actors get slashed, lazy actors get penalized.

Now that we understand the basics, let's dive into the most common misconceptions:

# FAQ

### PoS will make the rich even richer

If you read my comparison of the two systems, you are probably noticing that those two systems are not really that different from one another in this regard. In both systems, money means influence. A lot of real world money can get you a lot of mining hardware while a lot of real world money can get you a lot of ETH to stake. On PoW you buy hardware to strengthen your influence, on PoS you provide this money directly to strengthen your influence. On both, you have to reinvest your earnings to keep your position in the network or otherwise see it shrink by the rivals. Miners due to the difficulty increase, stakes due to the reward decrease and lower chance to propose a block. Both systems give incentives to participate in the consensus in the form of money.

While miners in PoW make way more money than their PoS counterparts, they also have way more running operational costs. But you'll earn less while staking than you'd be mining.

Example: 32 ETH right now (1 ETH = 1600USD) would get you about 5,1GH/s (51x 3080) of mining equipment. Using 17500W of power and at an electricity cost of 0.2USD/kwh and a pool fee of 1% would make you 1,100USD per month in net revenue. While staking those 32 ETH right now would earn you 0.1 ETH per month or 160USD per month.

Or when comparing annual ETH inflation of those two systems: PoS creates 607,500 ETH a year while PoW creates 4,414,310 ETH per year.

While the argument holds true that people with money can make more money in PoS, the same holds true for PoW. Or any other capitalist system for that matter. As we've seen with this example, PoW is more attractive to make more money and it does so even faster than PoS. PoW makes the rich richer is actually more true than the other way around.

### But PoS requires 32 ETH at stake. PoS is for the rich and therefore not decentral

Another pretty common misconception is that you need 32 ETH to stake. While this is true if you want to solo stake, you can also join a staking pool with just 0.01 ETH too. This is very similar to PoW once again since solo mining is not something the average miner can do to turn a profit, so they instead form pools and share their income. This is also true for PoS.

PoS has another advantage up its alley since there is yet again another thing that is not possible on PoW, namely decentral staking pools like Rocketpool. Where ETH is provided to smart contract that spins up a validator once 32 ETH has accumulated. The duties are performed by anyone that wants to be a Rocketpool node operator.

There are also centralized staking pool solutions like they are currently with PoW. The major downside PoS has here compared to PoW is that ETH is currently locked in at these staking pools. If you decide to switch pools, you may realize that this is either not possible at your centralized staking pool or if it's a centralized staking pool with liquidity to sell your stake, you might do so at some loss (for example Lido offers a liquid staking token called stETH that currently trades 7% below ETH).

I'd encourage people that don't have 32 ETH and want to stake to look into those decentral staking solutions like Rocketpool, since you are actually strengthening the network by making it even more decentral and can profit from it even without having 32 ETH. 

### PoS is way less secure than PoW

That's an argument I've seen in nearly every discussion about PoS. Currently there are more than 400,000 validators active on the beacon chain with a total value locked of 13 million ether. To attack the chain you'd need more than 6.5 million ether or more than 10 billion USD at current mark prices. Attacking Ethereums PoW chain for 1h costs about 800,000 USD according to https://www.crypto51.app (to include bitcoin in this as well since it is the gold standard of PoW, 1h would cost 650,000$).

Now this comparison is not really fair, though, since many would point out that the real price is way above that since acquiring 50% of the network computing power is not an easy task. But the same holds true for PoS, acquiring 50% of the current staking ETH supply is not easy either.

Plus PoS has limits in place on how many new validators can join or exit the validator set, so even if you were to acquire 6,5 million ETH, the time it would take to convert them to validators would take around 150 days (6 new validators per block, every 12s a block).

We learned that there are slashing mechanisms for bad actors and penalties for offline validators. Another thing that improves security significantly on PoS is the concept of finality. Once 2/3 validators agree on the canonical chain, this chain cannot be reverted without resulting in massive slashes. For users and exchanges this means that once a transaction has been finalized (happens after 2 epochs or roughly 13 minutes), you can be absolutely certain that this transaction can't be reverted any more. This is a major security benefit for exchanges and merchants and is something that is not possible with PoW.

Contrary to the questions we tried to answer here, PoS offers more security than their PoW counterparts.

### Ok so PoS is centralized since there are these centralized staking pools like Lido with currently 30% of all staked ETH

Lido is somewhat of a special case. While it's true that their market share is currently at 30%, not all of those validators are operated by Lido. Lido is somewhat de-central, meaning ETH is locked into smart contracts and pegs their liquid staking token called stETH. Lido has limited control over these funds and controls only a subset of these 30% of validators themselves. The node operation is outsourced to 25 different institutional node operators all across the globe, for example a few Ethereum PoS developer teams are node operators for Lido. These node operators earn 5% of those rewards and Lido has no more influence over the validators once they are operated by the node operators.

Remember that a validator cannot contradict itself and sign two blocks or attestations with the same height, so should Lido decide to intervene and start operating the validators themselves again after they have been passed on to node operators, those validators would immediately be slashed for contradicting themselves.

While I still discourage to use Lido for their market share, the argument against them is put into perspective when you realize that Lido is basically a pool of 25 different smaller pools. As long as they are committed to onboard more node operators, this won't be an issue. Compared to the current system under PoW where Ethermine controls 30% of all the hashrates and is the single node operator, a staking pool with 30% share and having 25 different node operators is definitely an improvement.

### PoS is still centralised, look at all the nodes being run by Amazon’s AWS

That's true, but you may ask yourself where all those Ethereum and Bitcoin mining pools operate. They too rely on clouds like Amazon or Google.

### But with PoW, Amazon and Google can't do anything since miners secure the chain

You may think that miners secure the chain, but in reality the pools are the ones that create the block. Miners solve the mathematical problem for the pool by creating this blog without knowing what's in the block or without the ability to use the solution for their own block. Simply put, the mining pool hands the miner a specific problem to solve that only the mining pool can use to create the block. So if Amazon or Google turn evil, they can attack PoW as easily as they can with PoS by just switching out the problem the miners need to solve to create an evil Amazon or Google block.

### But miners can switch pool if they get wind of this while in PoS you may not

First, you have way more people solo staking from home than miners solo mining from home. Secondly, PoS entertains the thought of social consensus, basically that the people that use Ethereum have a say in what they think is canon as compared to letting algorithms dictate what the canonical chain is. In such an extreme event where maybe even more than 50% of validators have been turned bad, the community can ultimately come together and embrace a minority chain and fork those bad actors out.

Just to illustrate the point though, this is a very unlikely event and would have huge impacts on the entire crypto scene regardless if it happens to a PoW chain or a PoS chain.

### PoS allows censoring of transactions like we saw with tornado cash

This has nothing to do with consensus, censoring is possible in both PoW and PoS. I know some Bitcoiners like to point that out as a flaw in Ethereum but fail to realize that this is a problem facing cryptocurrencies as a whole and could easily happen to them too. Instead of fighting each other, crypto should stand united against on chain censoring and put tribalism to side for this one.

### PoS is bad, remeber what happend to Luna?

This has again nothing to do with the consensus algorithm. What happened to Luna would have happened regardless of whether they would have run on PoW or PoS. The flaw was with their stablecoin system and not with the consensus system.

### Vitalik is the dictator of Ethereum, this makes Ethereum a centralized project

If Vitalik decides today to push a hard fork that would give him 10k ETH, no one in their right mind would run this update. Node operators have always the choice to reject an update by not running it. If Ethereum were centralised, there would not be an Ethereum Classic today and there won't be an EthereumPoW after the merge. People found reasons to reject the update proposed and came together to continue their version and let users ultimately decide which chain they want to be part of.

Also, contrary to for example Bitcoin, where Bitcoin Core is the only de-facto implementation of the Bitcoin protocol, Ethereum is committed to what's called client diversity. Overall there are 4 different execution clients for Ethereum and 5 consensus clients. Each client has their own dedicated team behind it. If there's a bug or foreign takeover in one client, Ethereum will continue to run thanks to these other clients. So Vitalik would have to convince four different development teams first to implement his 10k ETH fork and then convince the entire rest of the community, including all the nodes, stakers, exchanges and users to actually run it. 

As with Bitcoin, anyone can participate in the development of Ethereum and propose their own changes to the protocol in the form of an EIP (Ethereum improvement proposal).

### Ethereum trades security and decentralization for energy efficiency

If you made it through the entire post you already know that this is not true. PoS offers increased security, more decentralization, consumes less energy and cuts ETH inflation by a huge amount.

### So no draw backs then? That's rich...

PoS is an incredible engineering feat that took over 6 years to get right. But this does not come without some drawbacks. For one, PoS is an incredibly complex system. Especially when being compared to PoW, where the simplicity of PoW is arguably the main beauty of it. Developers like to avoid complexity at all costs since it increases the possibility of errors which is why PoS took that long to develop and thoroughly test. Another drawback is that staking is a far more complicated thing to do instead of mining. There are several steps to run your own validator, there's a requirement for permanent uptime and a wrong staking configuration that could end up costing you parts or even all of your staked ETH.  

The beautiful thing about PoS though is, that even though it's harder to stake, the protocol is actually designed to work together. You as individual staker earn more rewards if everyone is participating correctly then you would if someone set up their staking machine wrong. So you even have a selfish reason to help this staker to set up their device correct. Plus the people in staking are super nice and friendly, there are entire subreddits devoted to educate people about staking and helping them set up validators or offer advice on how to stake their sub 32 ETH. 

The last major drawback to date though is the inability to withdraw your funds. To keep the tight merge schedule, it was decided that withdrawal will be implemented in the first update after the merge. Which is realistically still 6-12 months away.

The last one, you can not initially distribute a coin with PoS. This is actually something that PoW does incredible well, the distribution of coins at the beginning of a project. 

TL/DR: PoS and PoW are actually more similar than you might have guessed. Many downsides PoS is criticized for exist in PoW as well. Some things PoS is criticized for is actually worse under PoW. If you want to learn more, read the entire thing.",21.0,2022-09-13 18:14:46,0.69

Ethereum 2.0: Does ETH become deflationary post-Merge?,"&#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/fpu04aqs6hn91.gif

We’re quickly approaching The Merge, the most notable upgrade in Ethereum’s history and a crucial turning point for the wider crypto industry. As the Ethereum blockchain transitions from proof-of-work (PoW) to proof-of-stake (PoS), The Merge is expected to be the bedrock upon which Ethereum’s scalability improvements are built.

As this highly anticipated event draws closer, the ETH community has begun hypothesizing that the rate of ETH burn will entirely offset and surpass the rate of newly issued ETH (the number of newly minted ETH issued per unit of time), resulting in negative net issuance. The theory is that more ETH will be destroyed than created over time.

But will ETH actually become deflationary post-Merge? In Kraken Intelligence’s latest report, the team takes an analytical deep dive into how The Merge may affect ETH’s net issuance rate.

### What does The Merge mean for ETH’s issuance?

The transition from PoW to PoS will impact ETH’s issuance rate.

At the moment, Ethereum PoW and Ethereum PoS operate in parallel, meaning there are two sources of ETH: miner rewards on the Ethereum PoW chain and validator rewards on the Ethereum PoS chain. Post-Merge, only Ethereum PoS will operate, eliminating miner rewards. Validator rewards will remain as Ethereum’s only source of issuance. 

### A nuanced approach

Our report sheds light on the importance of taking a more nuanced approach around the question of whether ETH will become deflationary post-Merge. 

We estimate the threshold base fee above which ETH becomes deflationary post-Merge – first focusing on estimating the threshold base fee at the time of writing – and then running sensitivity analyses to explore different scenarios. **We find that a threshold base fee greater than 15.43 gwei is required for ETH to become deflationary post-Merge** given the current number of validators at the time of writing this blog. For context, the 15.43 gwei threshold base fee is 19% higher than the average base fee was in August 2022 (13 gwei) and within the range of gas fees observed over the last 12 months (10-200 gwei). 

### What’s next?

Given the current gas fee environment, we predict a slightly inflationary ETH net issuance post-Merge. However, we expect to observe deflationary periods as network usage spikes.

[MEGATHREAD] The Ethereum Merge,"## MERGE SUCCESSFUL!!!!!!

Thank you to all the researchers, devs, mods, and supporters. Much love ❤️

## TLDR
Ethereum Mainnet will merge with the Beacon Chain proof-of-stake system, ending of proof-of-work (mining) for Ethereum. [Finematics TLDR video](https://twitter.com/finematics/status/1569311652067135489?s=20&t=3Z5AAWitUca7ArOm62YoVA)


## The Merge!
The Merge represents the joining of the existing execution layer of Ethereum (the Mainnet we use today) with its new proof-of-stake consensus layer, the Beacon Chain. (Formerly called Eth2)

It eliminates the need for energy-intensive mining and instead secures the network using staked ETH. A truly exciting step in realizing the Ethereum vision – more scalability, security, and sustainability. This will reduce Ethereum's energy consumption by ~99.95%.

The Merge is scheduled to happen on block 58,750,000,000,000,000,000,000 (that's a lot of zeros), so the actual date/time is a little bit of a moving target, but there are a few websites to help predict when that will be:

* https://bordel.wtf/
* https://wenmerge.com/

This is the first time a blockchain has swapped its consensus mechanism for another, live, uninterrupted.

## FAQs

* Will this affect transaction fees? Gas fees will not change
* Will there be downtime? Zero downtime
* Will transaction speeds change? Not noticeably

## Do I have to do anything?

If you own any Ethereum, ERC-20s (tokens), or ERC-721s (NFTs):

* Nope, enjoy :)

If you are a validator:

* Make sure your Beacon Chain Client is updated (lighthouse/lodestar/nimbus/prysm/teku)
* Make sure you have a *suggested-fee-recipient* configured
* Make sure your jwt secret is set properly from your execution engine client (geth/nethermind/etc...) in your beacon chain client config
* If you want to sanity check your setup, Somer Esat has great guides: https://someresat.medium.com/

If you a running a node:

* You will need to run a consensus client also, geth guide [here](https://geth.ethereum.org/docs/interface/consensus-clients) and consensus guides [here](https://someresat.medium.com/)

If you are a miner:

* After the merge, blocks won't be produced by mining anymore, thus no block rewards.
* You will need to run a consensus client (see ""running a node"") if you want to keep running a node.

**Frequently Asked Questions**

**Where's the best place to buy ETH?**

There are many centralized exchanges that support Ethereum. If you live in the US, the most popular exchanges are Coinbase, Gemeni and Kraken. Coinbase users can use Coinbase Pro for lower fees.

**When is Eth2 launching?**

Eth2 is a marketing term used to represent a number of updates to Ethereum. The Eth2 proof-of-stake chain first launched in December 2020. ""The Merge"", which is the event that will fully switch Ethereum's consensus to proof-of-stake, is estimated to be ready in early 2022, although there is no exact timeline. Other updates, such as data shards, will follow that update.

Visit [ethmerge.com](https://ethmerge.com/) to learn more about ""The Merge"".

**Do I need to do anything to update to Eth2? Will Eth2 create a new token?**

No, ETH holders *never* need to take any action to keep holding ETH. Ethereum users will be unaffected by the Eth2 upgrade. And the Eth2 updates will not create any new tokens.

**How can I stake my ETH?**

The best way to stake your ETH: by running your own validator.

* Running your own validator requires a modern computer and 32 ETH. Visit /r/ethstaker for more details

**Why are Ethereum transaction fees so high?**

Like most blockchains, Ethereum fees are determined by supply-and-demand. The large demand to use Ethereum has pushed transaction fees quite high (however, fees were just a few cents only 2 years ago). Fees are especially high during market volatility, and during NFT drops.

**What is being done to lower Ethereum transaction fees?**

Ethereum fees are reduced by using layer-2 rollups. Rollups are scaling solutions that allow for significantly cheaper transactions, while still maintaining Ethereum's security.

Additionally, Eth2's data shards will make rollups even cheaper.

While rollups are cutting-edge technology being actively developed, a number are already live on Ethereum mainnet. Visit [l2beat.com](https://l2beat.com/) to learn more about rollups.

**What's the best wallet for Ethereum?**

The most popular tool for using decentralized applications is Metamask. However, for security reasons, we recommend using a hardware wallet such as a Trezor or Ledger.

Over the next few weeks, you can look at this site and see in real time the effect (or maybe lack of, who knows?) of the Ethereum merge on the Nervos Network!  

The website tracks hashrate, which is a fancy way of saying how much power is being allocated to the blockchain in order to solve the algorithms responsible for proving consensus.  If Ethereum miners move over to other chains like Nervos en masse, you can expect the number at the top of the first image (78.06) to go up.  It’s important to note that this number fluctuates day to day, but the past month has had an average hashrate of around 82ish ph/s (peta hash per second).",21.0,2022-09-11 22:36:49,0.96

Ethereum APY reaches 6.15%+ on AAVE - a massive milestone in Crypto that can open the floodgate for institutional money in ETH and its ecosystem. Bullish flag for overall crypto! PERSPECTIVE,"ETH APY typically ranged from <1% (most of the time) to 1-2% often on AAVE but reaching 6.14% as of the time of writing this post is a pretty massive milestone!

That type of yield on the relatively most secured blockchain on a permission-less DeFi protocol (AAVE) can attract massive influx of institutional money. This was a big a reason for Solana's rise last year as institutions loved 6%+ yield on a well funded/ well backed project with stable and strong team. Now think about where Ethereum stands compared to Solana and what can a 6.15% APY unlock for it and its ecosystem. Merge itself is a big milestone for ETH but it is amazing to see that yield!

More power to ETH and its ecosystem. More power to entire Crypto universe!

The Ethereum Upgrade and Tomorrow’s Insider Open Trading Day,"Some great DD in the past has compared the NFT marketplace GME is creating to that of building a shopping mall and opening it to many new retail tenants. 

A huge day for a Real Estate Developer is opening day- that for Tenants, Customers, and the Mall itself. 

So when GME is drafting the “lease” agreements with new tenants (Immutable X, Mythonite, Blockbuster, all the others…) many months in advance how do you pick an opening date everyone can drive towards while not putting yourself at risk if the day moves a little? Well base it on the completion of someone else’s milestone of course- the ETHEREUM UPGRADE. 

In all of these “lease agreements” is probably a sentence like “GME Live Release marketplace to be opened XX hours/days after the successful completion of the Ethereum Upgrade”. Per the decrypt article linked below the completion date is expected between September 13-15. So most likely the Live marketplace opens sometime next week?

A piece of this equation that I enjoy trying to puzzle out is when RC Ventures will up their Ownership to 20%. Will it be through open market purchases starting with the insider trading window tomorrow or will it be some type of business merger also with a milestone date of the Ethereum Upgrade?

My current hypothesis is business merger and not buying on the open market. A business merger agreement created in the recent months with a milestone date based on the Ethereum upgrade removes insider trading worries, and it also limits the risk for RC Ventures, ie what if against all odds the Etherum upgrade completely fails.  

In Conclusion- lots to look forward to in the next few weeks. A major milestone- the Ethereum Upgrade- is almost complete. This milestone date was probably used in contractual agreements with NFT Marketplace “tenants” for the Live opening, and also with RC Ventures for a business merger.

"The amount of questions ""should I mine?"" or ""What happens after The Merge?""","These questions keep on coming and to be honest, no one knows the answer. But, here's something to think about my experience througout my short life so far. 

I started mining ETH in 2017 and they told me it will never be profitable, so why bother.

They also said in late 90's that Altavista will always be #1 search engine and somewhere around mid-90's they told me Netscape will always be #1 browser.

Hell, they said around 2006 that MySpace will always be #1 social platform. And the list just goes on.

My point? There will always be ""The next Altavista/Netscape/MySpace/Ethereum"" etc. Always. Tech goes on, someone does something better than the previous market leader at some point _always_.

Is Ergo the next Ethereum, solely in talks of mining profitability, though? I don't know, but I sure hope it is. And when I take a look at Ergo's biggest competitors in the PoW field (especially GPU mineable) I think Ergo is the strongest candidate to carry the flag after The Merge.

The next couple of months especially might be hard, but please remember we're mining ERG here, not USD/EUR etc FIAT money. The FIAT amount of ERG might be in loss for a unknown period of time, but I strongly believe one's efforts now will be paid generously in the future.

Die Zukunft ist jetzt - Das neue Finanzsystem,"     Originalbeitrag von „Rami54“ 

# 0. Vorwort

**TL;DRS:** Du fragst dich bestimmt, wo du dein Vermögen nach MOASS sicher aufbewahren kannst? Lege es am besten nicht in das derzeitige Finanzsystem. Denn der Dollar und die Banken sind nutzlos geworden. Das neue Finanzsystem wird kommen, GameStop's Plan ist die Einführung von Tokensierten Aktien (außerhalb des DTCC) und eine ETH-Adoption und MOASS wird den Reichtum aus dem alten System heraussaugen und in das neue System einfließen lassen.

Guten Tag Affen, seit GameStop einen NFT-Marktplatz auf Ethereum/Loopring eingerichtet hat, habe ich versucht, so viel wie möglich darüber zu erfahren, was Ethereum ist. Meine Schlussfolgerung ist, **dass es die Basis für ein neues und vollständiges Finanzsystem ist**. In dieser DD werde ich versuchen, eine einfache Erklärung dafür zu geben, wie das alte System grundlegend kaputt ist und wie das neue System aufsteigt und (mit einigen Spekulationen) was RCs Plan für GameStop und MOASS ist. Es ist kein Zufall, dass der Bestand an idiosynkratischen Risiken tief in das neue Finanzsystem eindringt.

# 1. Der Untergang des alten Finanzsystems

Beginnen wir mit einigen grundlegenden Konzepten. Das Wirtschaftssystem und das Finanzsystem sind zwei verschiedene Dinge.

* Die **Weltwirtschaft** ist die größte und komplexeste Maschine der Menschheit, sie enthält alles, was die Menschen produzieren, verteilen und konsumieren. Unsere gesamte Arbeit im Allgemeinen, unsere Wertschöpfung.
* Auf der anderen Seite kann man sich das **Finanzsystem** als ein Werkzeug vorstellen, das hilft, Werte zu bewegen und zu verfolgen. Es ist der Papierkram der Wirtschaft. Da es keinen Wert schafft, ist es nur ein Kostenfaktor für die Gesellschaft. Als solches sollte es danach streben, so klein und effizient wie möglich zu sein.

Die Realität sieht jedoch so aus, dass das derzeitige System genau das Gegenteil bewirkt, und das schon seit Jahrzehnten. Von 1947 bis 2010 stieg der Anteil der Einnahmen der Finanzindustrie am BIP von 2,5 % auf 7,5 %, und der Anteil der Finanzindustrie am gesamten Unternehmenseinkommen stieg in den USA von 10 % auf 20 %. Außerdem haben die Handlungen der für das System Verantwortlichen zu einer der größten Ungleichheiten in der Geschichte geführt. **Das ist einfach nicht tragbar, und irgendwann muss etwas kaputtgehen.**

Ich werde nicht zu sehr darauf eingehen, wie das System gescheitert ist und zusammenbricht, da es dazu eine riesige Menge an ausgezeichneter DD in diesem Beitrag gibt. Das Drucken von 40% aller Dollars seit 2020, die Rettung von Banken mit Billionen auf Kosten der Steuerzahler und die Schaffung einer Immobilienblase sind nur einige der Dinge, die die Verantwortlichen getan haben. Wenn du sie noch nicht gelesen hast, solltest du unbedingt *Criand 's ""The Bigger Short""*, *Atobitt 's ""House of Cards""* und *Peruvian\_Bull 's ""Hyperinflation is coming - The Dollar Endgame""* lesen.

Das derzeitige System ist besonders schlecht für das relevanteste Thema in diesem Beitrag, den Aktienmarkt. Obwohl der Handel fast in Lichtgeschwindigkeit abläuft, brauchen die gekauften Wertpapiere zwei Werktage, um abgerechnet zu werden, was viel Raum für Manipulationen und Verbrechen lässt. Manchmal wird das Wertpapier, für das man bezahlt hat, gar nicht gekauft und stattdessen wird es zu einem Fail-to-Deliver (FTD), einer synthetischen ""Aktie"" deines Brokers. Du hast ihnen Geld gegeben und dein Broker hat dir gesagt, sie hätten die Aktie für dich gekauft, aber in Wirklichkeit haben sie das Geld genommen und dir nichts gegeben. Wie in der DD ""House of Cards"" gezeigt wird, gibt es ein marktweites System für Naked Shortselling. Naked Shortselling bedeutet, dass synthetische Aktien aus dem Nichts geschaffen und verkauft werden, wodurch ein falsches Angebot geschaffen wird. **Durch die ""Bereitstellung von unendlicher Liquidität"" bricht Naked Shortselling das Gesetz von Angebot und Nachfrage, was die Grundlage der Wirtschaft darstellt.** Der Aktienmarkt kann nicht als echter Markt bezeichnet werden. Es handelt sich um ein imaginäres, von der Realität losgelöstes Spiel mit einem gefälschten Angebot und einem gefälschten Preis. Und das ist ein großes Problem, denn Unternehmen sind reale Dinge, die der Gesellschaft einen realen Wert liefern, und nun ist der Markt für ihre Eigentumsrechte, der als Grundlage der kapitalistischen Wirtschaft funktioniert, ein betrügerisches, erfundenes System.

Zusammenfassend lässt sich sagen, dass das derzeitige globale Finanzsystem gewachsen ist, immer größere Risiken eines Zusammenbruchs birgt, die Ungleichheit vergrößert und immer komplizierter und undurchsichtiger wird, bis zu dem Punkt, dass es unmöglich ist, es wirklich zu verstehen. Hinzu kommt, dass der Aktienmarkt seinen Zweck völlig aufgegeben hat und kaputt ist. Das System ist ein Parasit für die Wirtschaft und die Menschheit, und es gibt keine Möglichkeit, es zu reparieren. Sein Zusammenbruch ist unvermeidlich und findet gerade jetzt statt. Bedeutet das, dass auch die Wirtschaft zusammenbrechen und die Gesellschaft in Trümmern liegen wird? Zum Glück nicht.

# 2. Ethereum, die Basis des neuen Finanzsystems

Ethereum ist eine dezentralisierte Blockchain. Im Grunde ist es eine unglaublich sichere und wachsende Liste von Aufzeichnungen, die keine einzelne Instanz als Autorität hat. Jeder, der an dem Netzwerk teilnimmt, ist Ethereum. Im Gegensatz zu Bitcoin konzentriert sich Ethereum jedoch auf intelligente Verträge (smart contracts), und das ist der Hauptgrund, warum es sich von anderen abhebt und die Basis für ein vollwertiges Finanzsystem werden kann.

Ein intelligenter Vertrag ist wie ein normaler Vertrag oder ein Protokoll, das jedoch automatisch die Bedingungen des Vertrags ausführt. Dies ist sehr nützlich, weil es die Notwendigkeit von Vertrauen und Vermittlern beseitigt und auch die Kosten für die Schlichtung und das Betrugsrisiko verringert. Da man sich auf einer Blockchain befindet, sind intelligente Verträge außerdem unveränderlich und dezentralisiert, was bedeutet, dass sie sich nach ihrer Erstellung nicht mehr ändern und dass es für böswillige Akteure praktisch unmöglich ist, sie zu manipulieren.

>[Ein einfaches Beispiel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZE2HxTmxfrI&ab_channel=SimplyExplained): Anstatt Kickstarter für das Crowdsourcing eines neuen Videospiels zu nutzen, kann ein Entwickler einen intelligenten Vertrag abschließen, der besagt, dass er einen bestimmten Geldbetrag benötigt, verspricht, bestimmte Verpflichtungen zu erfüllen und ein Produkt herzustellen, das bestimmte Kriterien erfüllt. Leute, denen die Idee gefällt, können das Projekt finanzieren (indem sie Token des Vertrags kaufen), und wenn es nicht die erforderliche Geldsumme erreicht, bekommt jeder sie zurück. Wenn doch, geht es an den Entwickler, der sich an die Arbeit macht. Wenn das Produkt fertig ist, stimmen die Käufer der Token darüber ab, ob der Entwickler seinen Teil der Abmachung erfüllt und ein Produkt geschaffen hat, das den festgelegten Kriterien entspricht. Wenn dies der Fall ist, ist das Projekt ein Erfolg und alle Parteien erhalten, was sie wollten. Wenn nicht, können sie eine Rückerstattung erhalten.

Ein weiteres wichtiges Konzept, das man im Auge behalten sollte, sind Token. Wie Matt Finestone (Ex-Loopring-Experte und derzeitiger Leiter der Blockchain-Abteilung bei GameStop) sagt, sind Token eine natürliche Weiterentwicklung des digitalisierten Eigentums. Derzeit wird das Eigentum in Form von elektronischen Aufzeichnungen in einer herkömmlichen Datenbank dargestellt, was viele Probleme mit sich bringt. Da diese herkömmliche Datenbank vollständig von einer einzigen Institution verwaltet wird, ist sie anfällig für Angriffe, und diese Institution kann mit ihr machen, was sie will. Du weißt schon, wie die für Wertpapier zuständige Institution, die DTCC, mit ihrer Verantwortung umgeht. Andererseits haben Token auf einer Blockchain diese Schwächen nicht. Wenn man einen Token kauft und der Handel bestätigt wird, wird er sofort abgewickelt und man bekommt ihn tatsächlich. Er liegt nicht bei einem Broker oder einer Bank, sondern buchstäblich in deiner eigenen Wallet.

* **Fungible Token** können als Währung, wie ETH, LRC oder IMX, und als Wertpapiere, wie tokenisierte Aktien, funktionieren.
* **Nicht-fungible Token (NFTs)** können das Eigentum an einzigartigen Dingen wie Kunst, Spielgegenständen, Filmen oder Büchern, realen Gegenständen wie Skateboards in limitierter Auflage oder Luxusuhren und sogar Immobilien und Autos festlegen. Die Möglichkeiten dafür sind endlos.

Die erstaunlichen Vorteile von intelligenten Verträgen und Token sind die **Grundlage für dezentrale Anwendungen** **oder** **DApps**, die wiederum **dezentrale Finanzen, oder DeFi**, ermöglichen.

Die Wirtschaft braucht Finanzinstrumente, um zu funktionieren. Diese Instrumente sind monetäre Verträge, d.h. Währung, Eigentumsnachweise, Schulden und Eigenkapital (oder Aktien). Der Sinn von DeFi ist es, diese Instrumente zu haben, ohne sich auf Vermittler wie Broker oder Banken oder zentrale Behörden wie Zentralbanken oder Finanzämter zu verlassen. Gleichzeitig werden sie sicherer, zuverlässiger und frei von Gier und Korruption, die mit den Institutionen des derzeitigen Systems einhergehen. **Wenn man sich den derzeitigen Stand der Dinge ansieht, haben wir das leider wirklich dringend nötig.** Mit DeFi wird die scheiternde Fiat-Währung (USD) durch Ether (ETH) ersetzt, traditionelle Eigentumsverträge werden durch Blockchain-Token und NFTs ersetzt, eine Menge bürokratischer Papierkram erledigt sich von nun an von selbst, Transaktionen und Geschäfte werden nun sofort abgewickelt (soweit gesetzlich möglich), Aktien werden tokenisiert, der betrügerische ""Markt"" wird durch eine dezentrale Börse ersetzt, Banken und andere Institutionen wie Brokerfirmen werden obsolet, weil die Menschen ihr Vermögen selbst in die Hand nehmen und selber halten, was die meisten parasitären Mittelsmänner nun nutzlos macht. Wunderbar.

Intelligente Verträge sind da und sie funktionieren einfach. Ethereum, NFTs, DApps, etc. sind bereits da. Die Technologie für DeFi ist da. Bestimmte Produkte und Updates (wie ""The Merge"", das nächste Woche kommt) müssen noch fertiggestellt werden, aber die Dinge bewegen sich sehr schnell. **Was bedeutet, dass das Wichtigste noch die Akzeptanz ist. Die Menschen und Unternehmen müssen das alte System loswerden und mit dem neuen, unglaublich besseren System arbeiten.** Und ich glaube, hier kommen GameStop, Loopring und MOASS ins Spiel.

# 3. GameStop, Loopring und Wertpapier Token

In den letzten Jahren wurde GameStop in großem Umfang mit Naked Shortselling überzogen, und es wurde ein gefälschtes Angebot an Aktien geschaffen, das ein Vielfaches des tatsächlichen Angebots ausmacht, mit dem Ziel, das Unternehmen in den Bankrott zu treiben. Der Konkurs von GameStop ist jedoch vom Tisch, und das gigantische gefälschte Angebot ist immer noch vorhanden. Jetzt gibt es wahrscheinlich Millionen von Anlegern, die ein Vielfaches des tatsächlichen Angebots an Aktien halten und sich weigern, diese zu verkaufen. Wenn es zu einem Short Squeeze kommt, werden die Shortseller zu Käufern und erzeugen eine Nachfrage, die das Angebot um ein Vielfaches übersteigt. Das bedeutet, dass, egal wie stark der Preis steigt, das Angebot nie die Nachfrage deckt. **Dies ist ein entscheidender, fataler Fehler für das gesamte System.** Das Problem besteht nicht ""nur"" darin, dass der daraus resultierende ""Short Squeeze"" absurde Höhen erreicht, d. h. Hunderte von Millionen Dollar pro Aktie, sondern darin, dass der Kurs danach weiter steigt. Und dann wird niemand mehr Aktien verkaufen, aber es wird immer noch Aktien geben, die gekauft werden müssen. Der Preis wird ins Unendliche steigen. Nicht eine Milliarde oder eine Quintillion, sondern unendlich. Wie der IBKR-Vorsitzende einräumt, bedeutet diese Verknappung den Zusammenbruch des gesamten Finanzsystems. Alles bricht zusammen. Der Dollar wird unbrauchbar, der Aktienmarkt kann nicht mehr funktionieren. Wie die DTCC selbst in einem Bericht schrieb, gibt es eine bestimmte Aktie die ein idiosynkratisches Risiko für den Markt darstellt. **Das ist der Hauptgrund, warum ich glaube, dass RC und GameStop nach fast zwei Jahren dieser Geschichte noch nichts getan haben, was den Squeeze auslöst.** Ja, vor einem Jahr hätten sie eine NFT-Dividende ausgeben und den MOASS auslösen können, aber zu welchem Preis? Es gab kein Finanzsystem, das das alte ersetzt hätte, wenn es zusammengebrochen wäre. Und die Wirtschaft, von der der größte Teil unseres Lebens abhängt, braucht ein Finanzsystem. Daher bin ich der Meinung, dass MOASS nicht stattfinden wird, bevor das neue System fertig ist.

Zum Glück für uns Aktionäre sagen RC, Loopring und das GameStop-Team nicht mehr, als sie sagen müssen. Sie arbeiten einfach an ihrem Plan. Wir können die Punkte, die wir wissen, miteinander verbinden, um herauszufinden, woran sie arbeiten, aber es wird nicht mehr als eine fundierte Vermutung sein. Gehe also nicht davon aus, dass das alles, was als Nächstes kommt, in Stein gemeißelt ist. **Im Grunde besteht der Plan aber aus tokenisierten Aktien.**

Im Dezember 2018 schrieb Matt Finestone, der zu dieser Zeit bei Loopring arbeitete, [einen Artikel über tokenisierte Wertpapiere](https://medium.loopring.io/the-2019-truth-on-security-tokens-7800c14129e4). Ich empfehle dir, das ganze Ding zu lesen, aber einige wichtige Punkte sind:

>Programmierbare Compliance ist eine Win-Win-Win-Situation für Emittenten, Anleger und Regulierungsbehörden. Compliance durch Code - in den Wertpapier-Token selbst - macht das Leben aller Beteiligten viel einfacher. \[...\] Im derzeitigen System kann die Durchführung eines Handels die Überprüfung von Berechtigungen und Status in mehreren Ledgern erfordern, die von mehreren Parteien geführt werden. Die Erlaubnis und das 'Papieren' des Eigentumswechsels ist ein Prozess, der mit Reibungen und Kosten verbunden ist und viel menschliche Aufsicht erfordert. \[...\] Ich denke, dass es vernünftig ist zu glauben, dass eines Tages \[Regulierungsbehörden\] die Tokenisierung von Wertpapieren wegen der damit verbundenen Durchsetzbarkeit vorschreiben könnten. Sie müssten nie wieder Papierspuren verfolgen, alles würde sich selbst ausführen, und wenn etwas schief geht, ist der Beweis da, unveränderlich.

Im Grunde will er damit sagen, dass der derzeitige Wertpapiermarkt ineffizient ist und zu viel Aufsicht erfordert, um richtig zu funktionieren (und wir wissen, dass er das nicht tut). Die Tokenisierung von Wertpapieren würde eine Menge Unsicherheit beseitigen, alles würde sich selbst ausführen, und, was sehr wichtig ist, es wäre unglaublich einfach zu regulieren. **Programmierbare Compliance bedeutet, dass das Gesetz buchstäblich in das Wertpapier hineingeschrieben wird und es nicht dagegen verstoßen kann**. Und wenn etwas schief geht, bietet die Blockchain eine unveränderliche Aufzeichnung der Ereignisse an. Kürzlich sagte Gary Gensler, Leiter der SEC, dass eine auf Blockchain aufgebaute Börse eine gute Sache wäre, und das stimmt mich für die Zukunft der SEC leicht optimistisch. **Ein Gewinn für die Emittenten (GameStop), ein Gewinn für die Anleger (Affen) und ein Gewinn für die Regulierungsbehörden (SEC).** Die einzige Partei, die dabei verliert, sind die kriminellen Schmarotzer von WallStreet und Citadel, die die Ineffizienz und Unklarheit brauchen, um zu profitieren. Erinnerst du dich, als RC von einem GameStop twitterte, der ganz in der Nähe des SEC-Hauptquartiers lag? Ich denke, es ist möglich, dass das GameStop-Blockchain-Team und die SEC bei dieser programmierbaren Compliance zusammenarbeiten. Wie auch immer, lass uns zum nächsten Punkt von Matt übergehen.

>Wertpapier Tokens ermöglichen eine schnelle (sofortige) Abrechnung. Dies ist ein Vorteil für den privaten Wertpapierhandel, da es die Unsicherheit und das Kontrahentenrisiko verringert. Es stellt sogar eine Verbesserung für öffentliche Wertpapiere dar; öffentliche Aktien werden in der Regel ""T+2"" abgewickelt, d. h. das Eigentum an der Aktie wechselt tatsächlich 2 Tage nach der Ausführung des Geschäfts den Besitzer. Bei privaten Wertpapieren kann dies wesentlich länger dauern, in der Größenordnung von Wochen oder Monaten. \[...\] Das Abwicklungssystem ist hochkomplex, und Blockchains könnten einen Großteil dieser Komplexität beseitigen. Ich behaupte, dass Blockchains angesichts des Grades an Sicherheit bei der Aufzeichnung von Transaktionen einen viel besseren Job machen können als bisherige Technologien. \[...\] Und schließlich kann die Blockchain-Abwicklung die Dinge vielleicht wirklich beschleunigen, da der Token-Transfer automatisch den Rest der Abwicklungsräder in Gang setzt, wenn auch andere Prozesse durch intelligente Verträge ausreichend automatisiert werden können.

Das Abwicklungssystem ist zwar alt, aber es hat seinen Grund, denn die rechtliche Übertragung von Eigentum bedeutet, dass in der realen Welt immer noch Zeit für die Abrechnung benötigt wird. Die sofortige Abrechnung von tokenisierten Wertpapieren ist jedoch immer noch eine positive Sache, da sie unnötige Komplexität beseitigt und ein besseres System für die rechtlichen Anforderungen bietet, die auch mit intelligenten Verträgen automatisiert werden können.

Er schließt seinen Beitrag mit folgendem Satz ab:

>Ich denke bei Wertpapier-Token meist an einen einfachen Satz:  
>  
>**Auf die gleiche Weise, wie ein Großteil der Unternehmens- (und anderer) Finanzen mit Excel erledigt wird - auch wenn man andere Tools verwenden kann - könnte Ethereum eines Tages einfach die riesige Excel-Tabelle im Himmel sein, die alles so viel einfacher macht, dass wir uns fragen werden, wie wir jemals ohne auskommen konnten.**  
>  
>Ich denke, dass es immer offensichtlicher wird, dass finanzielle Vermögenswerte tokenisiert werden. Es ist eine Buchhaltungstechnologie, es sollte keine Überraschung sein, dass wir sie für... Buchhaltung nutzen. Und eines Tages...  
>  
>**Wir werden sie nicht Wertpapier-Token nennen, sondern Wertpapiere.**

Ethereum ist die riesige Excel-Tabelle im Himmel, die alles einfacher macht. Das ist genau das, was ein Finanzsystem sein sollte.

Matt liefert ein hervorragendes Argument für Wertpapier-Token. Die Tokenisierung von Finanzanlagen ist die unvermeidliche Zukunft, weil sie einfach funktioniert. Es ist einfach in allen Belangen viel besser als das System, das wir jetzt haben. **Da diese Token nicht aus dem Nichts entstehen können, wird auch das Hauptverbrechen, das GameStop überhaupt entstehen ließ, nämlich das Naked Shortselling unmöglich.** Es ist kein Zufall, dass Matt Finestone jetzt Leiter der Blockchain-Abteilung bei Gamestop ist.

Übrigens, ein halbes Jahr vor Matts Beitrag [schlug Byron von Loopring Elon Musk auf Twitter vor, einen Initial Coin Offering (ICO) von Tesla zu machen](https://i.redd.it/u33xc1ktc4r81.jpg), nachdem er behauptet hatte, das Tesla die am meisten geshortete Aktie sei. Auch wenn es sich bei dem Vorschlag nicht um ein tokenisiertes Wertpapier handelte (wahrscheinlich haben sich ihre Ansichten seitdem geändert, da Matts Beitrag erst danach veröffentlicht wurde), ist es kein Zufall, dass Loopring eine sehr geheime Partnerschaft mit der Aktie eingegangen ist, die aktuell die am meisten geshortete Aktie des Marktes darstellt.

Wenn also Wertpapier-Token die Grundlage des Plans sind, wie würde die Tokenisierung von GME ablaufen, und wie würde MOASS aussehen?

# 4. MOASS und der Übergang zwischen den Systemen

Nachdem wir nun die sehr plausible Annahme haben, dass GME tokenisierte Aktien ausgeben wird, lass uns nun durchgehen, was mit dem Finanzsystem und dem Aktienmarkt passiert, wenn es passiert.

Wir wissen nicht und können auch nicht genau wissen, wie der Aktionsplan aussieht, bis er bekannt gegeben wird. Ich denke, die wahrscheinlichsten Optionen sind entweder ein weiterer Aktiensplit in Form einer Dividende, aber diesmal im Verhältnis 2:1 und die neuen Aktien sind tokenisiert, oder sie geben einfach eine neue tokenisierte Aktie für jede bestehende aus, wobei die traditionelle Aktie nach einer bestimmten Zeit verschwindet und die Aktien effektiv aus dem aktuellen System entfernt werden. **Ein neues Wertpapier-Token, das an einer anderen Börse gehandelt wird, für jede bestehende ausstehende Aktie.** Insider, DRS'd-Affen und Institutionen erhalten ihre Wertpapier Token ohne Probleme. Die übrigen werden an ETFs und die DTCC zum verteilen verschickt. Von dort müssen etwa 100 Mio. Token auf, sagen wir, 300 Mio. bis 800 Mio. Aktien im wirtschaftlichen Eigentum verteilt werden. Eine unmögliche Aufgabe. Broker, die keine Aktien gekauft haben, und Naked Shortseller versuchen nun, echte Aktien zu kaufen, um ihre Token zu erhalten, aber es gibt einfach nicht genug. MOASS tritt ein und Short-Hedgefonds sowie Broker müssen die neuen Wertpapier-Token an der neuen Börse kaufen, um sie an die Aktionäre aus zu liefern. Der Preis des neuen GME-Wertpapier-Tokens schießt ebenfalls in die Höhe. Die zum Verkauf stehenden regulären und tokenisierten Aktien gehen zur Neige, aber es gibt immer noch Shorts, die geschlossen werden müssen. Citadel und Wall Street gehen in Konkurs, während der Preis ins Unendliche steigt. Wenn die Situation so bleibt, wird der betrügerische Aktienmarkt vollständig entlarvt und zusammenbrechen und die reale Wirtschaft schädigen.

GameStop kann dann ein neues Aktienangebot machen, das die Shorts schließen lässt, **aber das Angebot erfolgt in dem neuen Wertpapier-Token, der für ETH verkauft wird.** Jetzt kann GameStop neue Aktien kaufen, um sie an die Aktionäre zu liefern, die ihrerseits wählen können, ob sie sie halten oder für ETH verkaufen wollen. Nun kaufen die Shorts diese Wertpapier Token wieder, um sie an einen anderen Aktionär zu schicken, der auf seinen Dividendenanteil wartet. Wenn das nicht ausreicht, kann GameStop neue Angebote machen, bis die Shorts geschlossen sind, das Problem gelöst ist und der Aktienmarkt weiterlaufen kann. In diesem Prozess, der lange dauern kann, **verdienen GameStop und die Affen eine wahnsinnige Menge an ETH.** Gleichzeitig beginnt der ETH/USD-Kurs parabolisch zu steigen, da die SHF ETH kaufen müssen, um die neuen Aktien zu erwerben, und Außenstehende der Saga an der neuen Börse teilnehmen wollen. Und das Beste daran ist, dass die ETH\`s an GameStop und Affen gehen, und die Shorts mit nichts dastehen, denn sobald sie die neuen Aktien kaufen, müssen sie sie an uns abgeben. Ich hoffe wirklich, dass dies der Plan ist, denn es ist einfach wunderschön. Der Dollar (USD) verliert gegenüber ETH unglaublich an Wert, und ETH wird zur besten und wertvollsten Währung. Die FED tut wahrscheinlich das, was sie am besten kann, und druckt Billionen von Dollar, um sie den Banken/Fonds zu geben, damit diese ETH kaufen und MOASS lösen können, wodurch der Dollar weiter abgewertet wird.

# Dieser Schritt saugt effektiv Wert aus dem Dollar, der ohnehin auf dem Weg zur Hyperinflation ist, und gießt ihn in ETH. Es saugt den Reichtum aus der Wall Street und leitet ihn an GameStop weiter, das zum wertvollsten Unternehmen des Planeten wird, und an die Affen, die ebenfalls GameStop besitzen. Die Affen werden die neue reiche Klasse in dem glänzenden neuen und verbesserten Finanzsystem.

Dies ist eine Spekulation, und vielleicht ist der Plan, eine hohe Akzeptanz zu erreichen und das ETH-Ökosystem anzuführen (mehr dazu im nächsten Kapitel), sehr profitabel zu werden und dann ETH-Dividenden oder etwas Ähnliches auszugeben, wobei Wertpapier-Token später kommen. Selbst wenn der unmittelbare Plan tokenisierte Aktien sind, gibt es noch viele Ungewissheiten, wie genau das Spiel gemacht werden wird. Vielleicht ist die Währung der Zukunft LRC anstelle von ETH im Netzwerk von Loopring. Vielleicht ist GMERICA die neue tokenisierte Börse, die auf Loopring aufbaut, vielleicht arbeiten GameStop, Loopring und FTX gemeinsam an der neuen Börse, oder vielleicht werden die neuen tokenisierten Aktien an der bestehenden FTX-Börse gehandelt. Ich persönlich glaube nicht, dass letzteres der Fall ist. Vor zwei Tagen habe ich einen Beitrag verfasst, in dem ich argumentierte, dass der Wert von FTX für GameStop nicht in der **zentralisierten** Börse für tokenisierte Aktien liegt, sondern in den Systemen **FTX Card und FTX Pay**, etwas, das ein erstaunliches Potenzial hat, die Akzeptanz des neuen Finanzsystems zu erhöhen. Das bringt mich zum letzten Kapitel dieser DD.

# 5. GameStop in der Nach-MOASS-Welt

Wie ich in meinem letzten Beitrag erklärt habe, glaube ich, dass GameStop durch die Partnerschaft mit FTX den Leuten die Möglichkeit geben will, die GameStop Wallet und ETH zu nutzen, um Dinge im E-Commerce und im Einzelhandel von GameStop zu kaufen. Sie sagten, dass sie ""**mit FTX bei neuen E-Commerce- und Online-Marketing-Initiativen zusammenarbeiten werden**"" und dass ""GameStop der bevorzugte **Einzelhandelspartner** von FTX sein wird"". Ich denke, sie wollen die FTX-Karte, die wie eine normale Debit- bzw. Kreditkarte funktioniert, aber ohne die Notwendigkeit einer Bank, mit deiner Wallet verbinden. Dies wird es den Verbrauchern ermöglichen, Produkte mit ETH zu kaufen, auch wenn der Preis in USD festgelegt ist, und zwar mit großer Leichtigkeit. Letztendlich, wahrscheinlich nach MOASS, wird GameStop die Preise für seine Produkte in ETH anbieten. **Sie wollen das neue Finanzsystem nicht nur an der Börse anführen, sondern auch in der realen Weltwirtschaft, weil sie wissen, dass dies die Zukunft ist.**

Mit dem E-Commerce und Einzelhandel von GameStop wird man Konsolen, Videospiele, Kleidung, PC-Teile und alle möglichen Dinge der realen Welt mit ETH kaufen können. Auf dem NFT-Marktplatz kann man Kunst, Ingame-Gegenstände mit Immutable X, Bücher, Musik, Comics und vieles mehr mit ETH kaufen. [Da GME Entertainment wahrscheinlich Blockbuster erwirbt oder eine Partnerschaft mit Blockbuster eingeht](https://twitter.com/ryancohen/status/1550715696094466048), das mit Hilfe von NFTs zurückkehrt, wird man mit ETH auch Filme und Serien kaufen, mieten oder streamen können. **Und dann gibt es noch mehr Dinge, die in der Zukunft kommen werden**, neue Dinge mit MOASS-Aktienangeboten, die wir uns jetzt noch gar nicht vorstellen können. Ich bin unglaublich gespannt auf das, was kommen wird. Und das alles in einem Unternehmen, dem Unternehmen, das uns zum größten Teil gehört. Ein Hoch auf alle DRS'd-Affen!

# GameStop ist die Zukunft, und die Zukunft ist jetzt.

The Future is Now - The New Financial System,"# 0. Preface

TL;DRS: Wonder where to keep your wealth safe after MOASS? Don't put it in the current financial system. The dollar and banks are becoming useless. The new financial system is coming, GameStop's plan is tokenized stock and ETH adoption, and the MOASS will suck wealth from the old system and pour into the new. Please do try to read the post as I've made it as simple to understand as possible.

Good day apes, ever since GameStop started making an NFT marketplace on Ethereum/Loopring I've been trying to learn as much as possible on what Ethereum is. My conclusion is that it **is the base of a new and complete financial system.** In this DD I will try to provide a simple explanation on how the old system is fundamentally broken, how the new system is rising and (with some speculation) what is RC's plan for GameStop and the MOASS.  It is no coincidence that the idiosyncratic risk stock is going deep into the new financial system.

# 1. The Fall of the Old Financial System

Let's begin with some basic concepts. The economic system and the financial system are different things. The global economy is humanity's biggest and most complex machine, it contains everything that humans produce, distribute and consume. All of our work in general, our creation of value. On the other hand, you can think of the financial system as just a tool that helps moving and keeping track of value. It is the economy's paperwork. Since it doesn't create value, it is just a cost to society. As such, it should strive to be as small and efficient as possible.

The reality is, however, the current system is doing the opposite of that, and has been for decades. From 1947 to 2010, finance industry income as a proportion of GDP rose from 2.5% to 7.5%, and the finance industry's proportion of all corporate income rose from 10% to 20% in the US. Also, the actions of the people in charge of the system have created one of the highest levels of inequality in history. **This just isn't sustainable and eventually something has to break**.

I won't go too deep into how the system has failed and is collapsing since there is a gigantic amount of excellent DD on this from this sub. Printing 80% of all USD since 2020, bailing out banks with trillions at the cost of taxpayers and creating a housing bubble are only some of the things the people in charge have done. If you haven't read them already, you really should read u/criand 's [The Bigger Short](https://reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/o0scoy), u/atobitt 's [House of Cards](https://reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/mvk5dv), and u/peruvian_bull 's [Hyperinflation is coming - The Dollar Endgame](https://reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/o4vzau).

The current system is specially bad in the most relevant topic for this sub, the stock market. Even though trades get done at near the speed of light, the securities bought need *two business days* to settle, leaving plenty of room for manipulation and crimes to take place.  Sometimes the security you paid for doesn't even get bought and instead becomes an FTD, the ""share"" in your broker is synthetic. You gave them money and they told you they bought the share but in reality they took the money and gave you nothing. As shown in the House of Cards DD, there is a market-sized naked short selling scheme. Naked shorting means making synthetic shares out of nothing and selling them, effectively creating a fake supply. By ""providing liquidity"", naked shorts **fundamentally break the law of supply and demand, the basis of economics.** The ""stock market"" cannot be called a real market. It is some imaginary fixed game detached from reality with a fake supply and a fake price. And this is a huge problem because companies are real things that provide real value to society, and now the market for their property rights, which works as the base of the capitalist economy, is a fraudulent made-up scheme.

In summary, the current global financial system has been growing, gaining more and bigger risks of collapse, increasing inequality and becoming more complicated and obscure, to the point that it is impossible to truly understand. On top of that, in the stock market it has completely stopped doing it's purpose and is broken. The system is a parasite on the economy and humanity, and there is no way to fix it. It's collapse is inevitable and is happening right now. Does that mean that the economy will also collapse and leave society in ruins? Thankfully, no.

# 2. Ethereum, the base of the New Financial System

Ethereum is a decentralized blockchain. Basically, it is an incredibly secure growing list of records that has no single entity as an authority. Everybody who participates in the network, *is* Ethereum. However, unlike bitc0in, Ethereum focuses on smart contracts, and this is the main reason it shines above and can become the base for a fully fledged financial system.

A smart contract is like a regular contract or protocol, but that automatically executes the terms of the contract. This is really useful because it removes the need of trust and intermediators, and also reduces arbitration costs and the chances of fraud. Furthermore, because they are on a blockchain, smart contracts are immutable and distributed, which means they do not change after they are written and that it is practically impossible for malicious actors to tamper with them.

For a [simple example](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZE2HxTmxfrI), instead of needing to use kickstarter for crowd-sourcing a new videogame, a developer can make a smart contract that says that they require a specific amount of money, promises to fulfill specific obligations and make a product that meets certain criteria. People that like the idea can fund the project (by buying tokens of the contract), if it doesn't achieve the required amount of money, everybody gets it back. If it does, it goes to the developer who gets to work. When the product is finished, the people that bought the tokens make a vote deciding if the developer fulfilled their part of the deal and made a product that matches the established criteria. If they did, the project is a success and all parties get what they wanted. If they didn't, they can get a refund.

Another important concept to keep in mind are tokens. As Matt Finestone (ex-Loopring exployee and current head of Blockchain on GameStop) puts it, tokens are a natural progression to digitized ownership. Currently ownership is represented as electronic records in a regular database, something that has many problems. Since this traditional database is completely contained within a single institution, it is vulnerable to attacks, and said institution can do whatever they want with it. You know, like what the institution in charge of stocks, the DTCC, does with them. On the other hand, tokens on a blockchain don't have these weaknesses. If you buy one and the trade is confirmed, it is instantly settled and you actually have it. It's not in a broker or a bank, *it literally is in your wallet*. **Fungible tokens** can work as currency, like ETH, LRC or IMX, and as securities, like tokenized stocks. **Non-fungible tokens (NFTs)** can determine ownership of unique things like art, in-game items, movies or books, real life objects like limited edition skateboards or luxury watches, even real estate properties. The possibilities are endless.

The amazing benefits of smart contracts and tokens are the base for **Decentralized Applications or DApps**, which in turn make **Decentralized Finance, or DeFi,** possible.

The economy needs financial instruments to function. These instruments are monetary contracts, meaning currency, evidence of ownership, debt, and equity (or shares). The point of DeFi is having these instruments without relying on intermediaries like brokerages or banks, or central authorities like central banks or treasuries. While at the same time making them more secure, reliable, and free from greed and corruption that come with the institutions that make up the current system. Looking at the current state of affairs, we really, really need this. With DeFi, the failing fiat currency (USD) gets replaced by ether (ETH), traditional ownership contracts get replaced by blockchain tokens and NFTs, a ton of bureaucratic paperwork just gets done by itself, trades settle instantly (where possible by law), stocks become tokenized, the fraudulent ""market"" gets replaced by a decentralized exchange, banks and other institutions like brokerages become obsolete because people hold their assets themselves and the parasitic middlemen are now useless. Beautiful.

Smart contracts are here and they just work. Ethereum, NFTs, DApps, etc are already here. The technology for DeFi is here. Specific products and updates (like ""The Merge"" coming next week) need finishing, but things are moving very fast. **Which means the most important thing left is adoption**. **The people and companies need to ditch the old system and start using the new, incredibly better one**. And I believe this is where GameStop, Loopring, and the MOASS come in.

# 3. GameStop, Loopring, and Security Tokens

In recent years GameStop became heavily naked shorted, and a fake supply of shares *with a size* *many times the true supply* was created, with the purpose of forcefully bankrupting the company. However, bankruptcy is off the table for GameStop, and the gigantic fake supply is still there. Now there are probably millions of investors holding many times the true supply of shares who refuse to sell them. When a short squeeze occurs, the shorts become buyers creating a demand many times higher than the supply. Which means no matter how much the price rises, *supply never meets demand*. **This is a critical, fatal flaw for the whole system**. The problem isn't ""just"" that the resulting short squeeze will reach absurd levels, as in hundreds of millions of dollars per share, it's that it will keep going up after that. And then nobody will be selling shares but there will still be shares that need to be bought. The price becomes infinity. Not a billion or a quintillion, *infinity.* As admitted by the IBKR chairman, this squeeze means the collapse of the entire financial system. Everything breaks. The dollar becomes useless, the stock market cannot function. As the DTCC itself wrote in a report, one stock is an *idiosyncratic risk* for the market. **This is the number one reason I believe RC and GameStop, after close to two years of this saga, haven't done anything that triggers the squeeze**. Yes, a year ago they could've issued an NFT dividend and ignited the MOASS, but at what cost? There was no financial system to replace the old one after it collapses. And the economy, which most of our lives depend on, needs a financial system. So my belief is, the MOASS can't happen until the new system is ready.

Fortunately for us as shareholders, RC, Loopring, and the GameStop team don't say a single thing more than what they need to say. They just work on their plan. We can connect the dots on what we know to try to figure out what they are working on, but it will only be an educated guess. Don't take everything of what comes next as set in stone. Basically, **the plan is tokenized stock.**

In december 2018, Matt Finestone, who worked at Loopring at the time, [wrote an article on tokenized securities](https://medium.loopring.io/the-2019-truth-on-security-tokens-7800c14129e4). I recommend you read the whole thing, but some important points are:

>Programmable compliance is a win-win-win for issuers, investors, and regulators. Compliance by code — in the security tokens themselves — makes everyone's’ lives much easier. \[...\] In the current system, performing a trade may require checking permissions and statuses across multiple ledgers maintained by multiple parties. Allowing and ‘papering’ the change in ownership is a process wrought with friction and cost, and involves a lot of human oversight. \[...\]  I think it’s reasonable to believe that one day \[regulators\] may *mandate* securities to tokenize for the enforceability it offers. They would never have to chase paper trails again, everything self-executing, and if something did go awry, the proof is there, immutable.

Basically, he is saying the current securities market have is inefficient and requires too much oversight to function correctly (and we know it doesn't). Tokenizing securities would remove a lot of uncertainty, everything would self-execute, and very importantly, it would be incredibly easy to regulate.  **Programmable compliance means the law is literally written into the security**, and it can't act against it. And if something goes wrong, the blockchain provides an immutable record of what happened. Recently Gary Gensler, head of the SEC, said a stock exchange built on blockchain would be a good thing and that makes me mildly optimistic about the SEC in the future. **Win for issuers (GameStop), win for investors (apes) and win for regulators (SEC).** The only party that loses from this are the parasitic criminals on WallStreet and Citadel, that *need* the inefficiency and obscurity to profit. Remember when RC tweeted from a GameStop that was really close from the SEC headquarters? I think it's possible the GameStop blockchain team and the SEC are working together on this programmable compliance. Anyways, let's go to the next point Matt makes.

>Security tokens allow for rapid (instant) settlement. This is a positive for private security trading to reduce uncertainty and counterparty risk. It even represents an improvement for public securities; public equities typically settle ‘T+2’, so ownership of the stock actually changes hands 2 days after the trade was executed. Private securities can take much longer, on the order of weeks or months. \[...\] The settlement system is highly complex, and blockchains could remove a lot of that. I’d posit that blockchains can do a much better job than previous tech, given the degree of certainty regarding transaction recording. \[...\] Finally, maybe blockchain settlement can really speed things up by virtue of having the token transfer automatically set the rest of the settlement wheels in motion, if other processes can also be sufficiently automated by smart contracts.

The settlement system is old but is there for a reason, as legal transfer of ownership means time to settle may still be needed in the real world. However, the instant settlement tokenized securities offer still is a positive thing, removing unnecessary complexity and providing better a better system for the legal requirements, which can also be automated with start contracts, to work.

He concludes his post with this:

>I mostly think of security tokens in one simple sentence:  
>  
>**In the same way that much of corporate (and other) finance gets done on Excel — even though you can use other tools — Ethereum may one day simply be the giant Excel spreadsheet in the sky, making everything so much easier, that we will wonder, how did we ever do without?**  
>  
>I think it will become increasingly obvious that financial assets will tokenize. It’s an accounting technology, it should be no surprise that we use it for…accounting. Then one day…  
>  
>**We won’t call them security tokens, we’ll call them securities.**

Ethereum is the giant Excel spreadsheet in the sky that makes everything easier. Exactly what a financial system should be.

Matt makes an excellent case for security tokens. Tokenization of financial assets is the inevitable future, because it just works. It is simply way better in all things than the system we have now. Also, since these tokens can't be made out of thin air, **the main crime harming GameStop, naked shorting, becomes impossible**. It is no coincidence that Matt Finestone is now head of blockchain at Gamestop.

By the way, half a year before Matt's post, [Loopring's Byron suggested to Elon Musk on twitter to make a car-company token ICO after he claimed his car-company was the most shorted stock.](https://i.redd.it/u33xc1ktc4r81.jpg) Even though the suggestion wasn't a tokenized security (their views probably changed since then, considering Matt's post came afterwards), it is no coincidence that Loopring formed a very secret partnership with the *actual* most shorted stock in the market.

So if security tokens is the base of the plan, how would the tokenization of GME go, and what would the MOASS look like?

# 4. The MOASS and the Transition Between the Systems

Now that we have the very plausible assumption that GME will issue tokenized stock, let's go through what happens to the financial system and the stock market when they do.

We don't know and can't know exactly what the plan of action is until they announce it. I think the most likely options are either they do another stock split in the form of dividend, but this time it's 2:1 and the new stock is tokenized, or they just issue one new tokenized stock for each existent one, with the traditional stock disappearing after a set amount of time, effectively removing the shares from the current system. **One new security token that trades in a different exchange for each existing outstanding share.** Insiders, DRS'd apes and institutions receive their security tokens without issue. Then the remaining are sent to ETFs and the DTCC. From there they have to distribute around 100M tokens to, lets say, 300M to 800M shares in beneficial ownership. An impossible task. Brokers that didn't buy shares and naked shorts run to buy real shares to receive their tokens but there simply aren't enough. MOASS. Short hedge funds and brokers need to buy the new security token on the new exchange to deliver to the stockholders. The price of the new GME security token also skyrockets. Regular and tokenized shares for sale run out but there are still shorts that need to be closed. Citadel and Wall Street go bankrupt while the price goes to infinity. If the situation remains like this the fraudulent stock market will completely collapse and harm the real-world economy.

GameStop can then make a new share offering, that would let shorts close, **but the offering is in the new security token sold for ETH.** Now they can buy new shares to deliver to the stockholders, who in turn can choose to hold or sell for ETH. Now the shorts buy those security tokens again, to send to another stockholder waiting for their dividend share. If it is not enough, GameStop can make new offerings until shorts close, the problem is solved and the stock market can continue. In this process, which could take a long time, GameStop and apes **make an insane amount of ETH**. At the same time, the price of ETH/USD starts going parabolic since the SHF need to buy ETH to buy the new shares, and outsiders of the saga want to participate in the new stock exchange. And the best part is, that ETH goes to GameStop and to Apes, and the shorts remain with nothing because as soon as they buy the new shares they have to give them to us. I really hope this is the plan because it is just beautiful. The USD devalues against ETH at an incredible rate, and ETH becomes the best and most valuable currency. The FED probably does what they do best and print trillions of USD to give to banks/funds to buy ETH and solve the MOASS, further devaluating the USD.

# This move effectively sucks value out of the USD, which is on it's way to hyperinflation anyways, and pours it into ETH. It sucks wealth out of Wall Street and pours it into GameStop, that becomes the most valuable company in the planet, and Apes, who also own GameStop. Apes become the new rich class, in the shiny new and improved financial system.

Now, this is speculation and maybe the plan is to bring a lot of adoption and lead the ETH ecosystem (more of that on the next chapter), become very profitable and then start issuing ETH dividends or something like that, with security tokens coming later. Even if tokenized stock is the immediate plan, there are still many uncertainties in how exactly the play will be made. Maybe the currency of the future is LRC, instead of ETH in loopring's network. Maybe GMERICA is the new tokenized stock exchange built on loopring, maybe GameStop, Loopring and FTX are working together on the new exchange, or maybe the new tokenized shares will trade on the existing FTX exchange. Personally I don't think this last one is the case, two days ago [I made a post](https://reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/x8h4r4) arguing that FTX's value for GameStop is not in their **centralized** exchange for tokenized stocks, but in their FTX Card and FTX Pay systems, something that has amazing potential to bring adoption to the new financial system. Which brings me to the last chapter of this DD.

# 5. GameStop in the Post-MOASS World

As I explained in my last post, I believe by partnering with FTX, GameStop wants to let people use the GameStop Wallet and ETH to buy things from GameStop ecommerce and retail. They said they will be ""collaborating with FTX on **new ecommerce and online marketing initiatives""** and that ""GameStop will be FTX’s preferred **retail partner**"". I think they want to link the FTX card, which works like a normal debit card but without the need of a bank, to their wallet. It will let consumers buy products with ETH, even though the price is set in USD, with extreme ease. Eventually, most likely after MOASS, GameStop will set the prices on their products on ETH. **They want to lead the new financial system not only in the stock market, but to the real world economy, because they know it's the future.**

With GameStop ecommerce and retail, you will be able to buy phones, consoles, videogames, clothes, PC parts, and all kinds of real world things with ETH. With their NFT marketplace, you will be able to buy art, in-game items with Immutable X, books, music, comics, and more with ETH. Since GME Entertainment is probably acquiring or partnering with Blockbuster, who is coming back with the help of NFTs, you will be able to buy, rent or stream movies and shows with ETH. And then **even more things that will come in the future**, new things with MOASS share offerings that we can't even imagine right now. I'm incredibly excited for what's coming. All of this in one company, the company you own.

I also created a countdown timer: [https://lee.earth/themerge/countdown\_merge.html](https://lee.earth/themerge/countdown_merge.html)

The way the merge will start is actually really interesting and ***best explanation I can find is on a stackoverflow*** question, source here: [https://ethereum.stackexchange.com/questions/133429/what-exactly-will-trigger-the-merge](https://ethereum.stackexchange.com/questions/133429/what-exactly-will-trigger-the-merge) 

Basically the block that is mined with a total difficulty exceeding what they call as the terminal total difficulty TTD ( as it stands it is 58750000000000000000000 ) will trigger the Proof of Stake consensus to take over block production, this is the beacon chain.

Lots of info already but to sum it up.

The merge will NOT reduce gas fees nor will it increase transaction time however it most likely increase staking APR and No there will not be a a complete breakdown due to withdrawal since this function is not set to kick in until later and I guess staggered.

**Note: I did not do any of these calculations and al the hard work was from the authors** \- I just aggregated and took the average. Even the idea of the taking the average was inspired by a question here where someone ask if there was an average of all the estimates- can't link since it triggers a auto removal.

We may be in a bear market but I have never felt more Bullish,"I dabbled into crypto in 2017 but fell off the map when the bull cycle ended. I came back into the space in spring 2020 and have been deep into it ever since. I remember seeing ETH reach 2K, 3K, then 4K and was of course FOMOing in. I dreamed of prices below 2K, and BTC prices below 50K. I thought I had missed my opportunity of a lifetime. 

Fast forward to today - BTC is sub 20K and ETH is sub 2K, below 1.5K at times and even hitting triple digits. The crypto fear & greed index is at 20 again - extreme fear. These are prices I thought I would never see again. The opportunity of a lifetime is back. 

All of us here are holding in the likely bear market and weathering the storm. And it couldn't be a better time. Societal wide adoption is still extremely low. With 21 mil BTC that could ever exist, mass adoption over the next few years would create a demand could be unfathomable. Ethereum is about to merge from PoW to PoS, and will do wonders for further adoption and development for crypto as a whole. The future demand could be outrageous compared to today. 

Yet as the prices today remain well below ATH, there is so much promise for growth and adoption, and so much to be bullish for. This presents another ""opportunity of a lifetime"". Sure this is not like the opportunities before, but it's gonna be one hell of a ride. And I'm glad all of us who have remained in this space with that deep-seeded optimism get to be here for it this time around.",39.0,2022-09-08 14:40:30,0.74
Miners can't just move somewhere else: They are price takers,"I've seen a lot of people repeating the idea that Ethereum miners will simply move to some other PoW chain to mine on when the merge completes. However, this represents a fundamental misunderstanding of the way that mining rewards work.

## The key takeaway: It is the _developers of a PoW chain_ that decide _how much to pay_ for security. It is **NOT** the miners who decide _how much to **charge**_, they are simply **price takers**, who harvest whatever fixed rewards the developers have decided to set.

Specifically, effectively every PoW chain has a mostly fixed issuance model (ignoring transaction fees which are still a very small portion of rewards), where a predictable number of tokens are issued as part of each block mined: Whether a **hundred** or a _hundred thousand_ people are mining Bitcoin, it makes no difference, blocks are mined at the same rate and pay out the same amount of Bitcoin either way. That is, _the amount_ that the Bitcoin blockchain is paying for security is **exactly the same** no matter how many miners choose to join or leave the network. The same is true for other PoW chains.

The further implication is that when the merge completes, there are simply going to be **less total mining rewards available** in the crypto space as a whole. The existing Ethereum mining rewards don't ""move somewhere else"", they _straight up cease to exist_. The **only** three ways for more mining rewards to become available are:

1. Additional PoW chains are created

2. Existing PoW chains change their issuance model

3. The value of the tokens on existing PoW chains goes up

----

> _What about a (new) PoW fork of Ethereum popping up, doesn't that fall under number 2?_

Yes, however it doesn't appreciably change the amount of rewards available. 

Or at least it would be unprecedented for that to happen, as historically every fork has very quickly resolved to one side being worth >90% and the other being worth <10%, which would still remove most of the existing rewards available unless the PoW fork wins over PoS Ethereum (which is almost impossible for a number of reasons such as stablecoin mechanics that I won't go into here).

----

> _What about number 3, wouldn't miners moving to other chains change the sell pressure on those chains?_

This is another thing I think people have missed the key point on: People are **already mining on those other chains**. There's little reason to believe that the migrating Ethereum miners would make substantially different hold / sell choices with the tokens they mine than the existing miners do.

That's because the vast majority of mining is done at scale by people who effectively treat it as a business. If you're treating it as a business then you likely don't have any particular attachment to the tokens you're mining, you just mine wherever the profits are.

And if the hold / sell choices of the miners remain the same on those other chains... way more miners joining won't change the amount of sell pressure whatsoever: The same amount of tokens are being rewarded per block and the same percentage of them are being sold regardless of the number of miners / hashrate.

----

**TL;DR**: There's gonna be a whole lot of cheap graphics cards out there in a couple weeks. Like... even cheaper than they already are.",26.0,2022-09-08 08:45:54,0.74

THE MERGE IS ONE WEEK AWAY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Come celebrate “The “Merge” by minting a panda! As you all know, the panda has become the emoji that represents the merge, and this project is set to launch the day of the long awaited Ethereum merge, projected to be Sept. 15.

The goal of the Ethereum Improvement Pandas is to put the ""fun"" back in non-fungible, by having pandas wearing fun Ethereum related shirts. The various accessories could be as simple as a party hat, as we all hope to be celebrating a successful merge... or it could be a bit deeper, such as a Kiribati flag themed bandana, to represent a country that’s in danger due to rising sea levels. Our hope is that this becomes the first successful NFT minted solely on proof-of-stake Ethereum. But at the very least, these pandas will be fun to look back on years from now, to remember many of the memes we’ve come to know and love (Ultra Sound Money, Future of France, The Flippening, Ratio Gang, and so many more).

This project was created by the ManeNet DAO/EVMavericks community, and is solely intended to be a fun way to celebrate this significant event. There are no plans for a future DAO or roadmap, but we plan to have a forum inside the EVMavericks discord for EIPanda holders. That way, EIPanda holders can have some input as to how the DAO spends the proceeds.

WHITELIST DETAILS:

If you are a holder of one of these as of Sep. 10 at 1pm UTC, you will automatically be on the access list!

* Beacon Chain first 32,769 Block Validators (2021) POAP
* Beacon Chain first 1,024 Depositors and Proposers POAP

If you want to mint from a different wallet, feel free to move the POAP/NFT to another wallet and the snapshot will occur on Sep 10 at 1pm UTC. For those who do not qualify from the above, we are inviting any and all r/ethfinance users to sign up. The Access List is now open for sign ups and we plan to leave the access page open until September 10 at 1pm UTC.

*\*note: if you get a page error, try refreshing or giving it a minute and retrying*

MINT DETAILS:

With gas being so low recently, we decided to do a minimally priced mint at 0.003675 eth, with a 7.5% royalty. The supply will be 5,785.

From the mint proceeds, 50% will go to ManeNet DAO, approximately 30% to Pandas International, and the remainder to u/danksharting for creating the project. 100% of the royalties will go to ManeNet DAO to fund ethereum improvement initiatives. Since the project is launched on Autominter, they receive a small portion of the royalty as well.

As the name suggests, ManeNet DAO will look to be use the revenue in ways that improve ethereum, such as:

* Contributing to gitcoin grants
* Setting up decentralized validators
* Launching DAO initiatives (such as eth staking educational resources, etc)

The donation of $10k to Pandas International will cover the cost and care of a panda for one year. The panda we will look to sponsor is named Wen Wen, so that way the Wen Merge meme can live on. If this project takes off, we may look to do additional donations. [Link to Wen Wen](https://www.pandasinternational.org/other-ways-to-help-the-giant-pandas/adopt-a-panda/females/wen-wen-%e6%b1%b6%e6%b1%b6/)

LAST BUT NOT LEAST:

I would like to issue a challenge -- If we mint out within 72 hours of the merge, I will donate 100% of my earnings to Action Against Hunger (on the blockchain, of course). Their teams are responding to every major humanitarian emergency - from deadly flooding in Pakistan, to the worst drought in 40 years in the Horn of Africa (#ETH), and to the conflict in Ukraine.

ETH merge will flood other coins with 'unemployed' miners.,"The transition of the Ethereum network from proof-of-work (PoW) consensus is likely to flood the crypto industry with 'unemployed' Ether (ETH) miners, causing severe disruption to all PoW tokens. I have to say that I have long since shifted my interest to blockchain financial platforms like Algorand, Ovenue and DigiFt, so this may not affect me, but I still find it an interesting topic to discuss.  


I believe the upcoming Ethereum Merge will force PoW miners to look for greener pastures like other PoW blockchains and thus ""flood"" other coins - increasing the difficulty of mining and reducing profitability.  


As GPU miners point their hardware at other chains, their difficulty will increase, causing lower returns and splitting the reward among more miners.  


The migration will likely force many cryptocurrency miners to give up and abandon their expensive mining rigs.  


Hash rate will flow to alternative GPU PoW coins and many miners will simply give up and try to sell their card farms.  


GPU prices and demand were already falling due to falling Bitcoin (BTC) prices, which resulted in some cards being sold below list price and sellers trying to offload their mining rigs and cards at exorbitant prices.

What are the risks of the Merge? How do you plan to mitigate them?,"The “Merge” is when the Ethereum blockchain shifts from PoW to a PoS consensus mechanism through a merging of two blockchains. The upgrade will fundamentally change the way transactions take place on the Ethereum blockchain.

As of now, the Ethereum blockchain, like the Bitcoin blockchain, uses PoW, which involves nodes — computers that are part of a large network — competing with one another to solve complicated math problems. The successful ones are then able to mine the next block of a transaction and create new coins.

This process incentives users to consume more energy and purchase more powerful mining machines in order to increase their chance of getting rewarded with new coins. This describes why both Bitcoin and Ethereum are currently very energy intensive. However, the transition to PoS will solve this issue. 

Another problem with Ethereum’s current PoW mechanism is scalability. Ethereum currently can handle a total of 15 transactions per second. However, for the blockchain to go mass market and support the entire financial market, this limit is not acceptable. The transition to PoS will also solve this issue by increasing the network’s Transactions Per Second (TPS) capacity to one hundred thousand.

**What is PoS? And How Does it Work?**

Unlike PoW, which requires miners to compete for rewards based on the amount of computational power they can acquire, the PoS mechanism randomly selects validators relative to the total amount and time their ETH has been staked. 

Furthermore, PoS validators don’t need to mine blocks to maintain the network. Instead, they need to create new blocks when chosen and validate others when not. Once a validator, which has been chosen randomly, validates the latest block of transactions, others can attest (confirm) that the block is valid. 

When enough attestations are made, the network adds a new block. Rewards are then distributed in ETH to each validator in proportion to their stake. However, to incentivize good behavior, there is slashing, which is a form of penalty that causes validators to lose a portion of their staked ETH for going offline. 

To become a validator, users need to stake a minimum of 32 ETH. Those who can’t meet the threshold can still contribute by staking ETH in a pool (managed by third parties), and they will then receive a portion of the rewards. 

**Why is the Ethereum Merge happening?**

Proponents argue that the Merge will benefit Ethereum adoption by making it more energy-efficient. According to the Ethereum Foundation, the transition will allow the Ethereum network to reduce its energy consumption by around 99%. 

This could also help address environmental concerns regarding top cryptocurrencies. The negative impact on the environment of crypto transactions has been top of mind for many cryptocurrency critics, and Ethereum’s shift to the less-energy-intensive PoS is viewed as a significant advance.

As noted above, one more benefit of the Merge and PoS would be in terms of scalability. Following the merge, Ethereum is expected to be able to handle hundreds of thousands of transactions per second, compared to the current 15 transactions per second.

**When is The Merge?**

In recent years, developers have thrown around dates for when the long-awaited update to ETH 2.0 will take place. The update was even once expected to go through by the end of 2021, after which it was postponed to the second quarter of 2022 and then to the latter half of 2022. 

Nevertheless, the Ethereum Foundation has recently shared a tentative date for the Merge. According to a blog post, the upgrade will be fully completed between September 10 and 20. 

The activation is scheduled for epoch 144896 on the Beacon Chain, which should occur at around 11:34:47 UTC. After this, the Terminal Total Difficulty (TTD) value triggering the Merge will be 58,750,000,000,000,000,000,000. The Ethereum developers expect that TTD to be reached around September 15 to 16.

**How Does Midas Custodial Crypto-Investment Platform Plan to Handle the Merge?**

During this transformative upgrade, the first priority for [Midas.Investments](https://midas.investments/) is safety of user funds. The second priority is profitability. Here is how Midas plans to achieve these goals:

* Exit all ETH and DeFi strategies, close trend positions, and get native ETH assets on the new wallets to receive snapshots and hedge against potential market volatility. 
* If Fireblocks supports the ETH PoW chain on the first day, Midas will leave the assets on Fireblocks, which is the best custodial infrastructure. The team is communicating with Fireblocks on this matter. 
* If Fireblocks does not provide the speed of adding the new chain that Midas needs, Midas will migrate the assets to its own custodian infrastructure to claim the potential airdrop. 
* After the snapshot, Midas plan is to get all ETH\_PoW and all the assets that will be supported by the fork and sell them, convert them to ETH, and add ETH to the balance of every ETH holder. 

There is a chance Midas might limit swap transactions and deposit/withdrawals for a short period of time during the merge. 

“My advice on this Merge is to exit all DeFi pools, volatile assets, lending positions, and so on,” Midas CEO Trevor said. “Based on our research, ETH PoW fork will not support previous liquidity and stablecoins. Those contracts will be frozen at the start, so there is no chance of doubling your DeFi assets, including stablecoins.”",20.0,2022-09-05 18:27:57,0.86
NEO Marketing Idea ( Accumulate NEO and other strong coins during bear markets ),"Hello NeoKnights

I hope all of you are well. I've been accumulating NEO since 2018 bottom. I love the tech and the people behind it. Though, it has been a bit hard to see other projects soar with just the promise of smart contracts... including majors US exchange listings... And it makes you wonder...why isn't NEO doing the same when it offers a state of the art smart contract platform, with multiple coding languages and more. 

Marketing Idea for N3.

We need involvement/partnerships with the top Twitter/YouTube accounts to help educate the masses on NEO N3. Showing what NEO N3 can do. This may not be the right timing during a bear market but with the Ethereum Merge coming tomorrow. I think it is possible many will be disappointed with how the merge rolls out. It could be perfect timing for NEO N3 to be promoted on these channels. 

How should NEO N3 be promoted? The people that can get this done need to come together and have creative sessions to figure that out. ( Great ideas come from bouncing good ideas with smart and creative people )

I do understand...build first and then market. They have been focused on building something to last!  And I really do appreciate that and I am thankful to of found NEO!

Maybe this plan is in the works and I/We need to be more patient. 

I hope this post is helpful and that the right people see it. I'm happy to help if you view my efforts would be profitable to the NEO ecosystem.

Take care all!",32.0,2022-09-05 17:39:26,0.92

**Frequently Asked Questions**

**Where's the best place to buy ETH?**

There are many centralized exchanges that support Ethereum. If you live in the US, the most popular exchanges are Coinbase, Gemeni and Kraken. Coinbase users can use Coinbase Pro for lower fees.

**When is Eth2 launching?**

Eth2 is a marketing term used to represent a number of updates to Ethereum. The Eth2 proof-of-stake chain first launched in December 2020. ""The Merge"", which is the event that will fully switch Ethereum's consensus to proof-of-stake, is estimated to be ready in early 2022, although there is no exact timeline. Other updates, such as data shards, will follow that update.

Visit [ethmerge.com](https://ethmerge.com/) to learn more about ""The Merge"".

**Do I need to do anything to update to Eth2? Will Eth2 create a new token?**

No, ETH holders *never* need to take any action to keep holding ETH. Ethereum users will be unaffected by the Eth2 upgrade. And the Eth2 updates will not create any new tokens.

**How can I stake my ETH?**

The best way to stake your ETH: by running your own validator.

* Running your own validator requires a modern computer and 32 ETH. Visit /r/ethstaker for more details

**Why are Ethereum transaction fees so high?**

Like most blockchains, Ethereum fees are determined by supply-and-demand. The large demand to use Ethereum has pushed transaction fees quite high (however, fees were just a few cents only 2 years ago). Fees are especially high during market volatility, and during NFT drops.

**What is being done to lower Ethereum transaction fees?**

Ethereum fees are reduced by using layer-2 rollups. Rollups are scaling solutions that allow for significantly cheaper transactions, while still maintaining Ethereum's security.

Additionally, Eth2's data shards will make rollups even cheaper.

While rollups are cutting-edge technology being actively developed, a number are already live on Ethereum mainnet. Visit [l2beat.com](https://l2beat.com/) to learn more about rollups.

**What's the best wallet for Ethereum?**

The most popular tool for using decentralized applications is Metamask. However, for security reasons, we recommend using a hardware wallet such as a Trezor or Ledger.

$1k to $10k challenge: How I plan to play low-caps,"Hey everyone,

Welcome back. This is the last post of the intro series for the $1k to $10k crypto challenge. After this, I will finally build my initial portfolio and actually start to make moves.

In the previous post I wrote about my blue chip coin choices, coins that I consider inherently valuable and coins that have already made their mark in the crypto world. Now it’s time to get degenerate and look for those 20x, 50x, and even 100x opportunities in low caps. To do that, we have to find what will be trending in the next bull cycle.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/u3b1ybt15rl91.png?width=1053&format=png&auto=webp&s=26c8599ddcda8be65f209eab8050b533932d0b32

# Potential Next Hot Sectors

Last bull run we had DeFi (especially DEXes and loaning protocols), Alternative Layer 1s (like Solana, Avalanche, Near etc), NFTs, Gaming, and Metaverse.

In general, crypto sectors have two pumping periods: one when the innovation first comes out and everyone gets excited, and one when the technology actually gets adopted and utilized. The first pump is primarily based on hype and narrative. The second one is has more fundamental value backing it. I don’t really mind investing in either, as long as prices go up, I’m good. However, I do have to know which is which so I can know what to look for and make moves accordingly.

For 2022–23, my potential hot sector picks are the following:

## Layer 2s (Especially on Ethereum)

Blockchains need to be able to scale. If we expect network traffic to increase for most of the major Layer 1s, and especially Ethereum, this becomes a problem, even after the Merge. Layer 2s are a solid solution for significantly increasing performance without sacrificing too much security or decentralization. We saw Polygon surge in popularity and make big partnerships (Instagram NFTs), we see Arbitrum and Optimism support many DeFi protocols and explode in Value Locked. Some of these protocols, like Arbitrum don’t have tokens yet, so the play would be to do what I can to make myself eligible for an airdrop. Airdrops are big opportunities in general and I’m planning on making a full post on them once I’ve done enough research. Right now, what I keep my eyes on are Metamask and Arbitrum. Anyway, Layer 2s are in my opinion a very strong candidate for hottest sector in the next bull run. We see innovation like zero-knowledge proofs and roll-ups starting to get utilized and along with hype and narrative boosts, we can see Solana-like opportunities here.

## Interoperability

Right now, each blockchain is like an isolated island that cannot communicate with the other islands. We have solutions like bridges and wrapped tokens but this is not the full asset flow that is needed and, as we saw plenty of times this year, it can be pretty vulnerable to hacks and exploits. Different protocols need a way to connect to one another, especially in DeFi. Web3 needs interoperability and achieving it will be a game changer for the whole crypto industry. Right now, protocols are working on it and the ones that become successful can give out big returns.

## DeFi (looking mostly on financial innovation and derivatives)

Decentralized Finance is still the biggest and most important crypto use case. We’re still very early and there lots of things to be built. Right now, the biggest gap in the market is derivatives. Derivatives are the driving force of every financial market and we’ve yet to see that in crypto. Options trading in particular are very underutilized and are bound to explode as the market matures. I keep my eyes open for projects that try to that in DeFi, as well as any new financial products that become possible because of blockchain technology. Also, DEXes on underdeveloped Layer 1s (like Cardano).

## Gaming

I believe crypto gaming will disrupt the whole video games industry and change the way we see videogames. We already saw the hype pump, but we still haven’t seen a game that will take the world by storm and onboard millions of users into crypto. Axie Infinity made millions but it seemed more like a first mover advantage than anything else. The Play to Earn model creates new ways to make income, as it allows players to get a piece of the in-game purchases pie. I feel like crypto gaming is the way crypto will become mainstream and enter the pop culture. We see lots of gaming companies invest in blockchain and lots of developers building. I expect something big to come out in the next 2–4 years and start the revolution that will make crypto gaming a trillion dollar industry. I also keep my eyes open for investing opportunities in gaming studios and companies, launchpads, and projects that focus on providing the infrastructure.

## Metaverse

Another sector that already saw the hype pump and it’s very correlated to gaming. I believe the Metaverse will change the way we interact with the Internet the same way smartphones did. Facebook is already trying to get a piece of the pie, but having a centralized Metaverse could turn dystopian real fast. However, I believe we’re still extremely early. We don’t see much business utilities yet, but companies are definitely willing to pour money into the space. Although Decentraland and Sandbox are the current leaders, my bet is that the most popular and most utilized metaverse hasn’t come out yet. I still keep my eyes on these (mainly because I don’t think the hype pump is over), but I also look at projects that will be coming out this year (or later) and will benefit by the evolution and adoption of VR and AR technologies.

## NFTs (Mainly on infrastructure like marketplaces, protocols etc)

NFTs were the big thing of this bull cycle. I see them gaining even more popularity as they actually start to get utilized for more than just digital art. I look for protocols that provide the infrastructure for this to happen (like marketplaces etc). I’m certainly intrigued by the soulbound tokens idea proposed by Vitalik and will be keeping an eye on projects that try to implement it.

I don’t expect the NFT trading volume to drop in the next bull cycle. On the contrary, I think that the NFT art wave will continue, especially as more people onboard crypto, but I find it too risky to pour money into digital images.

There are some very strong brands that will emerge from the space (like Bored Ape Yacht Club) and it’s not a bad idea to invest in them, especially as there are so many celebrities endorsing them. If blue chip NFT brands manage to get into the pop culture the same way luxury streetwear brands like Supreme, or even well established names like Gucci and Luis Vitton did (which I don’t think is impossible), catching the wave early can prove to be extremely profitable. Ideally, I’d prefer to invest in these brands through tokens (like APE), because firstly I can be more flexible with the capital I allocate, and secondly there’s way more liquidity when I want to exit my positions.

# Conclusion

I will be monitoring these sectors closely, trying to find the most promising projects and look for early entry opportunities. Playing low caps requires a fundamentally different approach than playing high caps. Most of these tokens are from projects in start-up phases and should be treated as such.

Don’t view low caps as playing risky tech stocks. View it like funding a start-up. Some of these picks will inevitably fail, but the ones that succeed can give triple digit returns.

Ultimately, these bets will be the deciding factor for this challenge. And while good, fundamental research is essential for success, most of it depends on market state. It is very unlikely to expect multiple x returns while still in a bear market. My hope is that by the end of 2022, the new bull cycle will have begun and these tokens will outperform the rest of the crypto market.

# Outro

In the next blog post, I will distribute the initial $1k based on the percentages I outlined in the first post. Of course, this should go without saying, but this post, or any post in the series, is not in any way financial advice. Content is purely for informational and entertainment purposes. I’m not a financial advisor. I’m not even into finance. I’m just a guy that loves crypto and believes the crypto markets are full of juicy opportunities if you play your cards right. Can I do it? We’ll see. Thanks for reading and stay tuned. Updates coming soon.

P.S. Day 1 portfolio allocation happened today. The post is ready but I will share it tomorrow because the sub has a one post per day policy.

$1k to $10k challenge: The blue chips,"Hey everyone,

Welcome back. In the last post (which was a few hours ago), I mentioned how I plan to turn $1k to $10k in a year through crypto by mainly investing into two categories:

* “Blue chip” coins with high market caps
* Smaller cap coins in potential “hot sectors” of the next bull cycle

In this post I will explain what I mean by “blue chip” coins and give you my thoughts on the ones I keep my eyes on.

# 

https://preview.redd.it/tu3a9s88vjl91.png?width=1079&format=png&auto=webp&s=f1fc470a3e186b754c18901f5732da9f3619da4f

# What are blue chip coins

Blue chip coins are the picks I consider “safe”. They generally have a high market cap and have proven that they have fundamental value and utility and can survive the chaos of the crypto markets. In my mind, these are technologies and protocols that the world can’t do without and are destined to have a significant place in the industry once mainstream adoption happens. In a following post, I will discuss why I believe this mainstream adoption is inevitable, why crypto is the new internet and why we’re still very early. I consider the risk of investing in these tokens the same as buying high risk tech stock, but with significantly higher upside.

# The Coins

# Bitcoin

It is the one that started everything, it has the biggest market cap, it’s the most popular and has the strongest community.

In terms of technology, it is significantly inferior compared to newer crypto but it’s proven its worth time and time again. When the public hears about crypto, they think of Bitcoin. When institutions enter the space, they do it through Bitcoin.

In terms of upside it is significantly limited, but I consider it the safest crypto bet.

# Ethereum

I believe Ethereum is by far the best investment in the crypto space right now. It has the the most dapps build on it, it has the most developers, it has experience, it has a good founder, it is the center of innovation. When institutions enter crypto, its the most popular choice after Bitcoin.

Ethereum was significantly lacking in terms of performance compared to other blockchains, but it was still the most popular choice for developers and businesses. DeFi is mainly on Ethereum. NFTs are mainly on Ethereum. When people decided to build something big, they chose Ethereum. And all of this happened when it didn’t even make sense. Gas fees were so high at some point that the network was borderline unusable. And people still preferred it. But all of this is supposed to change in the upcoming weeks. The highly anticipated Merge, which will change the protocol’s consensus mechanism from Proof of Work to Proof of Stake, is scheduled for the middle of September. If Ethereum was already the market leader, imagine after the Merge, when performance will be on par with its competitors. And without miners it is estimated that selling pressure will be reduced by about 90%, as miners won’t be forced to sell their ETH to cover mining costs.

Even if the Merge doesn’t give the expected short term pump I’m hoping for, Ethereum is still the crypto I feel most comfortable holding long term based on fundamental value. I might be biased but it’s hard for me to not see ETH hit 10k in the next 3–4 years.

# BNB

Buying BNB is like buying Binance stocks. You essentially bet on the success of the company. Binance is the most popular centralized exchange in the world and it has remained fairly consistent since its launch. It looks like a steady, well run company, that managed to continue business as usual despite the recent bear market dumps. While competitors had to reduce costs and cut working force, Binance actually made hirings.

Every quarter they use a part of their profits to buy back BNB tokens, thus creating demand and raising the prices. It’s like a way of paying dividends to shareholders. Also, centralized exchanges are the most common way new users get into crypto because it’s easier and simpler to use. Since I expect wider adoption in the near future, I believe Binance will significantly increase its customer base, and revenue in the next bull run.

# Solana

I believe Solana has solid fundamentals and is a respectable competitor to Ethereum in terms of Layer 1s. It has lots of support from developers and VCs and has established its position as a high performance and low fees platform. It has some problems with DoS attacks, it’s not the most decentralized and has not proven itself during bear markets. I do see this as a solid token but I don’t find it as promising as Ethereum.

# Cardano

Cardano is a very controversial coin. It was the first blockchain to implement proof of stake, however they don’t have nearly as much dapps built on top of them as Ethereum or Solana. They have a very different way of doing things. They are methodical and careful, and put a lot of emphasis on academic research and peer reviews. Sometimes I feel like they fall behind compared to the rest of the industry and take too much time to make updates. They tend to delay things and that hurts the price of their token as crypto markets are very fast paced and impatient. We’re still waiting for the Vasil Hard Fork which was scheduled for late June. This is expected to resolve most performance issues and put them on par with the rest of the PoS Layer 1s. I still believe in them, for three reasons:

* Their emphasis on academic research and support from the academic community can lead to innovation that gives competitive advantage. I see this like a company that invests in Research and Development, sometime in the future this will pay off
* I believe that there’s a market for what they offer. It’s much more difficult to build on Cardano (it uses Haskel), but this generally leads to more stable and serious applications. I can see business or even governments who want to implement blockchain technology turn to Cardano for a safer and more solid solution.
* They just look like they’re trying to make the world better. They focus on banking the unbanked in Africa, they talk to regulators, and they try to be as decentralized as possible. It feels like a good project to be behind.

**Also interesting (but not as proven):**

# Polkadot

Solid ideas and a good team but still very unproven. Polkadot is actually a Layer 0 which means that it is a blockchain that helps other blockchains operate by offering them security, validators, and other resources, and by connecting them to one another (through the Polkadot chain). Instead of building on general purpose blockchains such as Solana and Ethereum, Polkadot can have application specific blockchains that are tailored to the needs of the dapps that are on top of them. The main challenge I see is encouraging developers to build on Polkadot’s parachains instead of the more mainstream Layer 1s. An equally interesting token is its cousin Kusama.

# Avalanche

An extremely fast Layer 1, probably the best one overall in terms of performance. However, when it comes to Layer 1 blockchains, performance is not the only thing that matters. Could see a pump similar to Solana, especially if it becomes the blockchain of preference for crypto gaming.

# Chainlink

Blockchains need data from the external world and Chainlink’s oracles is currently the best solution we have. It is a token that is fundamentally important for web3 and I can see it gaining even more value as we move towards wider business adoption.

# Polygon

I mention in the low caps post that I believe Layer 2s is one of the potential hot sectors of the next bull run. Polygon is the most popular scaling solution for Ethereum by far and I expect things to stay that way even after the Merge. They have good partnerships, they have a big name, and they innovate, so I expect them to keep growing. I believe price will easily surpass the All Time High in the next bull run.

# Conclusion

So this is everything in terms of high caps. From now on, when I mention blue chip cryptos, you’ll know exactly what I’m talking about. In the next post, I’ll analyze what I think will be the hot sectors of the next bull run and why. In general, when the market is uncertain and fearful I’ll lean towards blue chip picks or even cash. When the market is pumping, I’ll be mostly looking for moonshots in the hot sectors. That’s it for now. Thanks for reading, next post is coming out tomorrow.

Further Notice on the Merge,"Transfers of ETH and ERC20 tokens will be temporarily suspended on 6 and 15 September 2022

SEP 02, 2022 

https://preview.redd.it/nly436b4zhl91.png?width=1000&format=png&auto=webp&s=95db64862b94c89a820da05babadecd6d6d38676

 

A few weeks ago, we announced that Crypto.com App and Exchange will be [supporting the Merge](https://crypto.com/product-news/crypto-com-supports-the-merge). To share more on what will be the most significant update to Ethereum since its launch, in this post we’ll explain what the Merge is, what it entails, and what to expect before and after the Merge.

**What is the Merge?**

The Merge is the process of ‘merging’ the Beacon Chain (or the ‘consensus layer’) with the Mainnet (or the existing ‘execution layer’). The plan is to swap out the current proof-of-work (PoW) algorithm on the consensus layer and replace it with the proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus protocol that the Beacon Chain provides. 

**The Process of the Merge**

The Merge consists of a sequence of two upgrades — *Bellatrix* on the Consensus Layer followed by *Paris* on the Execution Layer. 

Bellatrix upgrades the Beacon Chain to be ‘Merge aware’, embedding the Beacon Chain with the Merge logic as validators begin monitoring the PoW chain to initiate the Merge transition. Bellatrix is scheduled for epoch 144,896 on the Beacon Chain, or approximately on 6 September 2022, 11:34 UTC.

Paris is the Merge transition itself, where Ethereum swaps its consensus from PoW to the Beacon Chain’s PoS. The Paris upgrade activates at the chosen Terminal Total Difficulty (TTD) of 58750000000000000000000, expected to take place between 10 and 20 September 2022. 

The target date is **15 September 2022**. However, this date might change as the TTD is based on the PoW difficulty, which is difficult to estimate precisely. Once the execution reaches the TTD, the Merge transition will be complete. 

**Possible Scenarios of the Merge**

There are two likely scenarios that will take place during the Merge:

* **Scenario A:** No new tokens are created during the Merge. Crypto.com will resume deposits and withdrawals for ETH and ERC20 tokens once the Ethereum Mainnet proves to be stable and secure.
* **Scenario B:** The chain splits into two, one following the PoS chain, and the other following the PoW chain. The ‘ETH’ ticker will be used for tokens generated on the PoS chain, while tokens generated on the PoW chain will be forked tokens. Crypto.com will resume deposits and withdrawals for ETH and ERC20 tokens once the Ethereum Mainnet proves to be stable and secure.

Before the Paris upgrade, forked token creators may take snapshots of users’ ETH balances. Supported forked tokens will be distributed to users proportionate to their ETH holdings and will then be available for withdrawals. Details regarding the distribution will be included in a separate announcement. Crypto.com reserves the right to update the treatment of the chain split in a further announcement.

**What Crypto.com will support**

* The forked token will go through the same listing review process as Crypto.com performs for all other tokens. We will notify users in a separate announcement if the forked tokens will be listed. 
* Crypto.com will not support the forked token if the PoW network does not prove to be stable. Tokens created during the Merge that are deemed as illegitimate will not be supported. Crypto.com reserves its full discretion whether to support forked tokens created during the Merge. 
* Wrapped ETH may or may not qualify for distribution of forked tokens depending on the specifics of the fork projects, which continues to evolve. 
* Loaned ETH will not be eligible to receive forked tokens.
* Merchants under Crypto.com Pay for Business will not be eligible to receive the forked token. Merchants who would like to receive the potential forked tokens can withdraw their ETH from their Crypto.com Pay merchant account to an external wallet that supports the forked tokens. 

**Trading and Deposits/Withdrawals**

To ensure the safety of users’ funds during and after the Merge, deposits and withdrawals of ETH and all ERC20 tokens will be temporarily suspended during Bellatrix and Paris. Crypto.com will provide an update on the specific date and time in a separate announcement. Trading of ETH and all ERC20 tokens will not be affected. 

**Spot Trading (the App and Exchange):** The Merge will not affect spot trading for ETH and ERC20 tokens on the Crypto.com App or Exchange. This includes automated purchases from Recurring Buy and Grid Trading Bots on the Crypto.com Exchange. Note that pending ETH orders that have not been executed from Recurring Buy in the Crypto.com App and the DCA and Grid Trading Bots on the Crypto.com Exchange will not be counted in the snapshot time for the forked tokens.

**Margin Trading:** New ETH loans made with Margin will be temporarily suspended starting from 2 September 2022, 4:00 UTC till the Merge is completed. Existing ETH loans will not be impacted and users can continue to carry out margin trades for ETH cross and isolated margin pairs on the Crypto.com Exchange. Crypto.com will temporarily suspend the transfers of loaned ETH to the Spot Wallet during the suspension time mentioned above.

**Lending:** New ETH loans made on Lending and P2P Lending will be temporarily suspended starting from 2 September 2022, 4:00 UTC till the Merge is completed. Existing ETH loans will not be impacted. 

**Futures and Perpetual Trading**: The Merge will not affect ETHUSD perpetual swaps or ETHUSD futures trading in the Crypto.com Derivatives Exchange.

**Crypto Earn**

The Merge will not affect the existing Crypto Earn services. Supported forked tokens will be proportionately distributed to users with ETH allocations in Earn. No further actions will be required from the user. Rewards distributed after the Merge will be paid out in ETH PoS tokens.  


**Crypto Credit**

If a user has taken up a loan with ETH as a collateral, the existing ETH collateral will be treated as ETH PoS. No further actions will be required from the user. 

* Upon repayment or liquidation of their loan, their collateral would be returned in ETH PoS
* If the user needs to top up their collateral, they will need to put in more ETH PoS.

If a forked token was created after the Merge, the forked token will be distributed proportionate to the amount as the ETH placed for collateral.

**Spending Power**

If a user has taken up a loan with ETH as a collateral, the existing ETH collateral will be treated as ETH PoS. No further actions will be required from the user. 

* Upon repayment or liquidation of their loan, their collateral would be returned in ETH PoS.
* If the user needs to top up their collateral, they will need to put in more ETH PoS.

If a forked token was created after the Merge, the forked token will be distributed proportionate to the amount of ETH placed for collateral.

**Fiat Services**

The Merge will not affect fiat services.

Take note: 

* You will not need to do anything to protect your funds before the Merge. Any funds held in your wallet will still be accessible. No action is required on your part. 
* The entire history of Ethereum since genesis will remain intact and unaltered after the transition to PoS.
* Be on high alert for scams trying to take advantage of users during this transition. There is no ‘ETH2’ token and you do not need to take further actions to keep your funds safe.

Crypto.com reserves the right in its sole discretion to amend or change or cancel this announcement at any time and for any reasons without prior notice.

"The Ethereum merge is approaching and so are rumors about a PoW chain split, make sure you know about replay attacks and how to avoid them","**First, what is the worst that could happen**

If you interact on the ETHPoW chain, all your ETH could be taken away. (You are safe if you never interact on the PoW chain and there are precautions you can take to prevent your ETH from being stolen)

**What is a replay attack**

A replay attacks is where code can be reused on multiple blockchains. This can be very problematic if the re-used code is you sending ETHP and is re-used to send your ETH away as well 

It's easiest to explain in an example. ETH AND ETHPoW (which I will now call ETHP) share much of the same code and all of the same history up until the merge. After the merge, let's say Alice wants to send 1 ETHP to Bob, since she sees it as a quick way to make an extra buck from a chain she doesn't see a future in.

In order to do this, she creates and signs a transaction with her private key which tells the validators that she approves of the transaction and broadcasts it to the ETHP nodes/miners. The ETHP miners pick up this transaction, quickly process it and Bob has the 1 ETHP in just a few moments.

However, Bob, or anyone else, can post that same transaction to the ETH nodes/validators. Since the transaction of 1 coin from Alice's wallet to Bob's wallet is valid and signed by Alice, the transaction will also be processed by the validators. Alice will have lost her ETH without intending to because she didn't account for a replay attack.

**What can you do?**

Luckily there are ways to mitigate a replay attack.

The most fool-proof way to keep your ETH safe, don't touch the PoW chain. (I'm sure you saw that coming, but you didn't read all this way to hear ""don't touch your coins""

Here is another thing you can do. Send your ETH to another address you own. Settling up a new wallet or using an existing known secure wallet, or even exchange is all fine.

(If you are a slightly more advanced user and know what you are doing and can check the transaction nonce, you can also chose to send the coins back to the same wallet)

What is important is that you make a transaction to yourself on the ETH Blockchain (not the ETHP Blockchain and I will explain why later)

After the ETH transaction is confirmed, you can then transact from your ETHP wallet without issue. You are safe now because the only transaction that can be replayed is to your own wallet on the ETHP Blockchain.

If at any time you notice that your transactions from the ETH chain were re-broadcast to the ETHP chain, stop what you are doing and just leave your ETHP coins untouched. It isn't worth losing your ETH over.

If you are an advanced user who sent your ETH to the same wallet, make sure your ETHP transaction has the exact same nonce as your initial ETH transaction so the two cannot be used at the same time.

As noted earlier, you should not move your ETHP balance to another wallet and then try to sell your ETHP from the new wallet, because this movement to the fresh wallet and the sending out of this new wallet can both be replayed on the ETH chain.

**On the practicality of the PoW chain. Will it have value**

A lot can be said here, but I will keep it to a brief few points. Overall in my opinion the value of the PoW chain is essentially non-existent. There are a few major obstacles that would need to be overcome in order to justify it

1. The ice age and requiring a fork. The ice age is already started. So any PoW chain will need to delay or remove the ice age entirely to have any chance at survival. In practical terms this means that you need to distribute new code to the miners and hope they run your new code after the merge. You won't be able to just get lazy miners who forget to turn off mining to mine on your PoW chain because you *need* them to run an updated version. IE action is required for them to support a fork

2. Baggage. Most dapps as well as NFTs and tokens are not planning to support ETHP. This leaves ETHP with all the transaction history that needs to be supported, but none of the benefits. Only ETHP itself could really be relied upon. It would probably be better to start a fresh ETH chain as PoW from scratch or maybe start with the same wallet balances and no other transaction history fo avoid the. Seedless bloat that would otherwise be there.

3. Replay attacks. This is what the post was about. It's not hard for a developer to add a piece of code to stop replay attacks to the ETHP chain. Bitcoin cash managed to implement replay protection. If this step isn't done, then I wouldn't take the chain seriously. 

4. Miners having something to mine and sell seems to be the main justification for this chain. If it's only use is for people to sell it, then it doesn't deserve to exist for long. Give a real reason why it has reason to exist (and exist over ETC) otherwise, this is just a ploy to make money

**TLDR**

Replay attacks allow an attacker to send your ETH when you only meant to send PoW ETH. Your best bet is to simply avoid the PoW chain, but if you want to sell your ETH PoW and don't mind taking some risk, I'd suggest reading the post for mitigation techniques.

The value of any PoW ETH chain is dubious at best.",70.0,2022-09-02 14:41:51,0.86

Chasing Moonshots: $1k to $10k challenge and how I plan to do it,"Hey everyone,

I’ve been following the crypto markets for almost two years now and I have to admit that I’m hooked. And how can you not be hooked? They’re fascinating. In no other financial market you can consistently 10x your money in a year when you make good investments and go -90% in a year when you make bad investments.

This extreme risk and extreme reward balance makes crypto the most exciting playing field for money you can afford to lose. It’s not the best option if you want to get rich slow but it sure is the best option if you want to get rich (or get poor) quick.

So I decided to take on a challenge. I will try to turn 1k to 10k through crypto in one year and will document the whole process on social media. I will share all the moves I’m making and the thought process behind them, and I will provide weekly updates.

I’m nowhere near an expert trader or an experienced investor, I just really like crypto and want to challenge myself, and prove that getting abnormal returns is not purely luck. I expect this to be a learning process and a fascinating journey no matter the end result.

https://preview.redd.it/2h5kpqf9pcl91.png?width=1080&format=png&auto=webp&s=a9f555acb62acf262adc96374376211f1ffc5108

# The challenge

I will start with an initial capital of $1k and will try to turn it into $10k or more by next year. This would represent a 10x annual return. This is a extremely unnatural performance for traditional markets, not so unnatural for crypto. The challenge starts September 1st 2022 and ends September 1st 2023.

# Investing process

I will not be utilizing technical analysis or any kind of trading bot. The moves I’ll be making will be based purely on fundamentals, strategy, and market conditions. This is not a knack against technical analysis, I just don’t like using it (and I’m not very good at it). Plus, just looking at charts wouldn’t make such interesting content.

# Strategy

Since we’re in a bear market, my strategy has three characteristics:

* A portion of the initial capital will be held in cash ready to deploy (for dips, Dollar Cost Averaging and special opportunities)
* A portion of the capital will be allocated in blue chip coins with high market caps. These are coins that have proven their worth and utility and are expected to at least reach their all time highs again. These are coins I’m comfortable with holding long term and do not mind staking/earning yields on them, unless the opportunity cost is too high
* The remaining capital will be allocated towards smaller cap coins in what I believe to be the hot sectors of the next bull cycle. These are more speculative bets, riskier, but with higher upside

I will also be on the look out for airdrops or DeFi opportunities that can maximize returns. I will generally stay away from NFTs since I’m not comfortable with my knowledge on the sector.

# Current market conditions

Right now, the crypto markets, just like all asset markets, are mainly influenced by macroeconomic factors. The inflation situation is currently the most important thing to look at. Recession fears are still valid but for the first time in months, the CPI numbers showed signs of peaked inflation. However, the FED made it pretty clear that interest rate hikes are not stopping anytime soon and the markets reacted heavily. The next CPI report is going to be crucial. If inflation is going up again, I expect prices to plummet.

September has historically been a terrible month for crypto, so I’m not very optimistic in general, but this time we have the Ethereum Merge happening. I don’t expect any significant drops, at least until the CPI report that comes out September 13th. Long-term, this is probably going to be a tough winter, for lots of reasons, but mainly because of the increased cost of energy (due to the Ukrainian-Russian war).

Since I don’t want to get wrecked before I even start, and since we’re under uncertainty, I’m going to start with the following distribution:

* 35% cash
* 40% high caps
* 25% low cap bets

The main strategy will generally stay the same throughout the challenge but the percentages will change according to market conditions (and the progress that has been made) to keep risk at fairly the same levels.

Of course, this should go without saying, but this post, or any post in the series, is not in any way financial advice. Content is purely for informational and entertainment purposes. I’m not a financial advisor. I’m not even into finance. I just love crypto and believe the crypto markets are full of juicy opportunities if you play your cards right.

In the next post, I will analyze the “blue chip” cryptos that I keep my eyes on for this challenge, and give you my thoughts on each one of them. After that, I will write a breakdown of the potentially hot sectors of the next bull run(low cap bets). I expect both of these to come out later today. Let me know if you're interested in the series and/or have any feedback. Thanks for reading and stay tuned!

Got 32 ETH and want to solo stake,"Hey everyone, I bought a dappnode NUC recently but haven't set it up. I won't be staking before the merge and until I know everything is stable, but I'm scared about set-up given I have next to no technical know-how. Is there any resource where I could get some handholding? I feel like I'm not alone - the Ethereum foundation should run some sort of official webinar or something to help people through this process.

Sept 6th is the deadline to upgrade validators for the Merge! NOT THE 15TH,"**You must update your validators by the 6th to be Merge ready.** This also means you must run execution clients yourself. Infura as the execution client should be removed or the fallback parameters to Infura deleted if you added it to your clients. 

Syncing execution clients like Geth or Besu takes time from a few hours to days depending on your validator specs or VMs. Do not leave this step to the last minute. Also don't use Geth.

Why is it the 6th? I thought it was around the 15th? The Merge is happening in two steps called **Bellatrix** and **Paris**. From Ethereum.org:

> The Merge is a two-step process. The first step is a network upgrade, Bellatrix, on the consensus layer triggered by an epoch height. This is followed by the execution layer's transition from proof-of-work to proof-of-stake, Paris, triggered by a specific Total Difficulty threshold called the Terminal Total Difficulty (TTD).

The timing of the first step of The Merge for the 6th: 

> The The Bellatrix upgrade is scheduled for epoch 144896 on the Beacon Chain -- 11:34:47am UTC on Sept 6, 2022. 

Vitalik also [tweeted out to everyone that the 6th is the deadline](https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin/status/1564458813616295937?s=20&t=p9sM3WOgd05SDdCI5pc1iQ):

>Reminder: even though the merge is coming around Sep 10-20, the beacon chain hard fork is on Sep 6. Make sure to update your clients before then!

It is also strongly recommended to switch to a minority execution client now because 

* 1) if there's a critical bug in Geth you will lose most of your stake while Geth is the supermajority EL client. Why risk your validator's ETH when you can just do a switch from a majority client like Geth or Prysm to a minority client in 15 minutes or less of command line? 
* 2) You can use Infura as the fallback while your other EL client syncs up for now until the Merge. Use it while you can to not lose validator income. 
* 3) /u/superphiz will come for you if you don't diversify the network

To make sure you also configured other vital steps such as the JWT prior to The Merge, here's a [great checklist from coincashew](https://www.coincashew.com/coins/overview-eth/ethereum-merge-upgrade-checklist-for-home-stakers-and-validators). Just do it before the **6th** and keep track of any last minute client updates. *The 6th everyone, let's get it done before the 6th!*",126.0,2022-09-01 21:02:46,1.0
What you should know about The Ethereum Merge on Kraken,"&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/1hiif25o5bl91.png?width=1200&format=png&auto=webp&s=0bf5c765d5da4821010a328afae7bc9b09c2a1da

Over seven years ago, [on August 8, 2015](https://blog.kraken.com/post/254/kraken-launches-ether-trading/), Kraken was the first exchange to make Ethereum (ETH) available to millions of users. Today, we’re thrilled to announce that Kraken will support [the Ethereum Merge](https://support.kraken.com/hc/articles/8650291932820) that is estimated to take place between September 10-20, 2022.

The Merge marks the end of Ethereum’s [proof-of-work (PoW)](https://www.kraken.com/learn/proof-of-work-vs-proof-of-stake) mechanism and the beginning of its transition to a [proof-of-stake (PoS)](https://www.kraken.com/learn/proof-of-work-vs-proof-of-stake) model. This transition is a two-step process. The first step is a network upgrade, “Bellatrix” (scheduled for Sept 6, 2022), on the consensus layer. “Paris” (expected between Sept 10-20, 2022), the execution layer's transition from PoW to PoS, will follow.

The Merge is a major milestone for the Ethereum community and Kraken endeavors to support this event in ways that help our clients and Kraken's mission *to accelerate the adoption of cryptocurrency so that you and the rest of the world can achieve financial freedom and inclusion.*

### General operation: holding, staking

Ethereum PoS will retain the ETH ticker after the Merge and ETH trading markets will remain active and available just as they have prior to the network update. 

In order to ensure a smooth transition, deposits and withdrawals for ETH and all [Ethereum-based (ERC20) tokens](https://support.kraken.com/hc/en-us/articles/360000678446-Cryptocurrencies-available-on-Kraken) will be temporarily suspended during the Merge. Visit [status.kraken.com](https://status.kraken.com/) for real-time updates.

**Your assets will remain safe, as always, and no action is required on your part. There will be no need to convert your existing ETH into anything else before, during or after the Merge. It will continue to be visible as ETH in your balances.**

After the Merge, staked ETH (ETH2.S) balances won’t be unlocked or made available to unstake or transfer until a forthcoming update of the Ethereum network (the “Shanghai upgrade”) is complete, thereby enabling those features for the ecosystem. Please note: Kraken has no control whatsoever over this process and no official date has been announced for this upgrade.

Reward rates for your staked ETH are currently estimated at between 4% and 7% annually (RPY); these rewards are locked in your account as ETH2. These rewards will continue as usual after the Merge. **Additionally, you will also receive a new set of rewards for on-chain activity post-Merge. These new rewards will be credited to your account as** **unstaked ETH****.**

### Forked tokens

A fork is an event that takes place when a blockchain diverges into two potential paths forward. In this case, it is possible that Ethereum will fork into a PoW blockchain and a PoS blockchain. 

Kraken will subject any newly forked token(s) that might come into existence before, after or during the Merge to our standard, strict review process before making any token available for trading. We will be paying close attention to the potential forked chains. However, it is not guaranteed that any such forked tokens will be made available for trading, [as per our policy](https://support.kraken.com/hc/en-us/articles/115013895208-General-statement-on-forks-airdrops-and-addition-of-new-cryptocurrencies). 

In the case that Kraken decides to support trading of ETH PoW (or other forked tokens), new spot markets would be created.

Even if Kraken does not decide to support trading of ETH PoW (or other forked tokens), Kraken may still decide to support custody of ETH PoW (or other forked tokens). In that case, if you hold ETH in your account, we would credit your account with a new ETHW (or other designated ticker) token. 

Please note: it is possible that ETH deposits sent closer to the Merge event may not count toward the snapshot of users’ ETH balances. **Only settled account balances at the snapshot time will be considered.**

### Margin

Traders holding open margin positions during the Merge need to be aware of the treatment of their positions, as forking tokens can impact your account once credited/debited. 

In the event Kraken decides to support custody of ETH PoW (or other forked tokens resulting from the Merge), margin positions will be treated as if the user held the underlying ETH, which means that Kraken will:

* **Add** the relevant amount of forked tokens to the account for ETH long positions
* **Deduct** the relevant amount of forked tokens from the account for ETH short positions

Below is an example assuming Kraken supports the custody of an ETH fork token (*ETH\_Fork*):

If a client is long 10 ETH on ETH/USD at the time of the Merge, we will **add** 10 *ETH\_Fork* to their account once Kraken supports the custody of *ETH\_Fork* (+10 *ETH\_Fork*).

If a client is short 5 ETH on ETH/USD at the time of the Merge, we will **deduct** 5 *ETH\_Fork* from their account once Kraken supports the custody of *ETH\_Fork* (-5 *ETH\_Fork*).

To reflect that deduction, clients who have a short ETH position at the time of the Merge will see a **Negative Balance** entry in their account, if and when Kraken supports the custody of  *ETH\_Fork*. Negative balances can be resolved either by depositing the appropriate token and amount, or by purchasing the appropriate token and amount on Kraken.

Clients who are long on ETH/BTC, ETH/EUR, ETH/GBP, ETH/USD or ETH/USDC are **Long ETH.**

Shorting those pairs would make a client **Short ETH.**

However, clients who are long on ADA/ETH, LINK/ETH or DOT/ETH are **Short ETH**.

Shorting those pairs would make a client **Long ETH**.

This treatment of forked ETH tokens applies to any and all liabilities/borrows across Kraken products.

*Why the deduction on short margin positions?*

*An amount of ETH was provided to you to support a transaction with leverage. To close the position, you must return the same amount of ETH, but you are also responsible for returning any proceeds resulting from a network fork that occurred during the time the ETH was provided to you.*

Updates will be provided on our [official Kraken blog](https://blog.kraken.com/) and official twitter accounts ([@krakenfx](https://twitter.com/krakenfx) and [@krakensupport](https://twitter.com/krakensupport)) as more information becomes available.

"Ethereum might split into 2 chains after the merge- A historical look at price action of previous splits with Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin, and Monero","Whenever there's a hard fork, there's a chance one coin splits into two.  The first time this occurred was with Ethereum in July 2016, due to the DAO Hack, which created Ethereum Classic.  Since then, other notable forks include Bitcoin to Bitcoin Cash (July 2017), Bitcoin Cash to Bitcoin SV (November 2018), Litecoin to Litecoin Cash (February 2018), and Monero to Monero Classic (April, 2018).  

All these splits happened for philosophical reasons I won't get into, but what I am interested in exploring is how the old and new chains reacted in the market and how the price action played out.

The following table lists the 5 hard forks that caused the splits.  The prices listed were gathered from CoinMarketCap and listed as the close price on the appropriate date.  You will be able to see the price movements through the years and the relative difference of the old chain to the new chain.  The dates listed are the first date CMC had price info on the coin, not necessarily the day the fork happened.

**NOTE:** To scroll through the table, scroll to the bottom of the post. There will a scroll bar.

What is “data availability” and why is it the top priority for Ethereum’s development team right now? Let’s talk about it:,"# EDIT: I've previously posted about both the merge and Sharding. All of these subjects are related and intertwined so I would really suggest you give them a quick read

Objectively speaking, Ethereum by far has the top-tier ecosystem on the market with some of our favorite projects and dApps built on it.

However, Ethereum is also infamous for its high gas fees, slow transactions, and overall lack of scalability and efficiency.

One of the major reasons behind this problem is “data availability” or more precisely the lack of it.

In order to explain what “data availability” is, we first need to talk about Ethereum nodes and how and where they store data. We also need to discuss L2s a little bit so I’ll try to make this as easy as possible for the average Joe to understand.

# - What are Ethereum nodes?

Ethereum nodes are essentially a group of computers that keep a full and comprehensive record of every single activity that happens on the entire Ethereum blockchain.

This obviously takes up a HUGE amount of precious and expensive space and processing power which renders Ethereum quite inefficient.

The main issue here is that a lot of this stored data is not being used and will most likely never be used. But its still there non the less and will always be there even after merging and sharding are implemented.

# - What is data availability?

Data availability as a concept and practice is not something new. It has been around for a while. But things get complicated when blockchains are involved and thus this concept on Ethereum is still new and not fully implemented.

Data availability is the practice of storing data off of the operating system or network (in this case, the Ethereum blockchain) and only presenting the needed data at the needed time.

**Here’s a nice analogy:**

**Let’s say you work on a computer but that computer has so much data stored that it’s making it very slow and clunky in performance. You also realize that you don’t need ALL of the data at once yet you still want to keep that data just in case you ever needed it someday.**

**What you do is you end up storing said data on a designated computer or hard drive and only extract the information you need at the current moment thus relieving much of the strain on the computer you work on.**

Now, this process is a bit more complicated when blockchains and the billions of dollars of transactions and assets on them are involved because there should always be irrefutable evidence that the stored data is indeed there and isn’t being tampered with.

This is where L2s get involved.

# - How can L2s help with data availability?

After the merge is fully implemented and Sharding is introduced, L2s will gain a lot of extra throughput to process information and gain faster prover times.

As mentioned before, the Ethereum beacon chain itself won’t be scalable. This responsibility will fully lie on L2s some of which are already working on scaling solutions focused on data availability.

This is why I was focused on mentioning Polygon in all of my previous posts regarding the merge and sharding because they’re developing a data availability scaling solution (Polygon Avail) and they actually just released the testnet yesterday (it was part of the reason that made me compelled to write this post and explain the importance of data availability for the future of Ethereum

Scaling solutions like the one being developed by Polygon store all the massive counts of data off of the Ethereum chain and provide only the needed information at a given moment while still giving irrefutable proof that the entire compilation of the Ethereum database is indeed intact and untampered with.

# - Conclusion?

When we talk about dank sharding, we’re actually talking about multiple upgrades but the most important of them all is indeed data availability.

If Ethereum wants to stay secure and decentralized but also fix the scalability problem, then data availability should be the main focus (and it is).

I hope I was able to explain the importance of data availability in a way that the average Ethereum user can understand without getting into so much technical detail.

As per usual, I’d love your feedback in the comments and would happily answer any questions there as well!",76.0,2022-09-01 13:05:38,0.96

"If you had $10,000 to spend on any cryptocurrency you wanted, what would you do?","Hey guys, what would you do if you have $10,000 to buy any crypto you want?  


Since I've been a part of this community for years, I would love to hear your opinion pls, I already heard many times ""You need to research each and come to a decision based on gained knowledge, not by random people on the internet who may or may not know what they're talking about,"" but I'd still like to hear your experiences and opinions.  


Truth be told I want to invest 10,000 dollars into Bitcoin, Ethereum, and some interesting Altcoin with a lot of potentials.  


I already bought some of ETH last year, started getting this whole picture of crypto, getting to know all about it (still learning), and started using Metis as an L2 solution, but I hope this all will be reduced after the merge and the price are gonna rise and rise once again.  


What do you think about buying ETH now? We're seeing that the ETH price started rising, it actually started a fresh increase above the $1,600 resistance against the US Dollar. Do you think it's now gaining pace and might rise further towards the $1,650 level?  


Is this scenario possible for ETH, that a clear move above the $1,650 level might send the price towards $1,700 resistance? I suppose that any more gains may perhaps open the doors for a test of the $1,750 resistance in the near term.  


Would love to hear your thoughts, thanks.",55.0,2022-08-31 07:49:14,0.87
"To quote the Ethereum Foundation: “The Ethereum ecosystem is firmly aligned that Layer 2 scaling is the only way to solve the scalability trilemma while remaining decentralized and secure.""","I’ve been seeing a lot of people especially on subs like r/cc claim that “the merge will make L2s irrelevant” but this is simply NOT TRUE. In fact, the complete opposite is true and I think it’s a little ignorant not to learn about this and subsequently spread misinformation in the crypto space.

On the contrary to what these people believe, L2s will be the main focus for the Ethereum development team in the upcoming years as the merge happens and then dank sharding starts getting developed.

L2s won’t only be helping Ethereum scale its new beacon chain, they will literally become part of that chain down the line.

A lot of people are confusing merging with sharding and these two are not the same.The merge will not make gas on Ethereum cheaper, in fact, nothing will.

What the merge will do is significantly reduce power consumption (more than 99%) and pave the way for sharding which will in turn give a major boost of L2s and their throughput.Ethereum’s beacon chain will always be expensive to operate and will instead rely on L2s to handle the data.

In fact there are already scaling solutions being developed solely for that purpose most notable of which is Polygon Avail which will store data off chain and present only the data needed at the moment. This kind of scaling solution will drastically help with traffic and gas fees and will transform Ethereum into a much more efficient kind of blockchain.

So don’t go out thinking L2s will get phased out. Ethereum will rely on them heavily in the upcoming years.In fact Ethereum already relies a lot on L2s as I imagine the vast majority of us use them every single day.",439.0,2022-08-31 07:35:59,0.95
"After the merge, what are we going to be excited about next?","We know the Eth merge is close, it will reduce how much electricity Ethereum needs, which is great, but that's about it! It will also probably produce a mainnet fork, with some groups of miners wanting to continue PoW, but I'd expect that to be about as exciting as ETC. But who can blame the miners for wanting to keep their job? Unsure if it's going to be very profitable?

Then what? What are we going to be excited about next? Sharding in 2023 would be my pick, but also production grade zkEVMs are probably due for 2023?",78.0,2022-08-30 13:39:28,0.76
Ethereum’s Potential Fork," **The Ethereum Merge has been estimated to happen around September 15th. The role of the current Ethereum miners will be played out. Or will it? If they choose to continue mining the current (then: old) Ethereum chain, will there be two Ether coins? Indeed. Some exchanges have already signaled they will list a possible ETH POW coin post-Merge. How to deal with this?**

First, a reminder of what the Merge is. The network that we know as Ethereum (ETH1) will be merging with the Beacon Chain (ETH2). Until the Merge, the Beacon Chain is a separate network running parallel to Ethereum.

The Ethereum Merge refers to the merging of the current Ethereum blockchain and the chain that is now running in parallel and being tested: the Beacon chain. This Beacon chain, which is based on Proof-of-stake (PoS), will become the main chain after the Merge. It will, as it were, swallow the old chain, including its entire history.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/k7cyyxfu1tk91.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&s=6fa503ecbdf96436d60c7b7605df6005f1a890d8

**Will you Own Double the Amount of ETH Coins Post-Merge?**

In principle, and after all the dust will have settled, nothing will have happened. So don’t stress. Your existing ETH will work just as it always has and be unaffected. You do not need to do anything. You don’t need to buy another ETH asset to participate in Ethereum 2. But for those of us who are interested in deep-dives and trading, listen to this.

After the Merge, the miners are no longer needed to secure the Ethereum blockchain and are invited to switch off their equipment - or move to Ethereum Classic, which will stay a proof-of-work chain.

But miners have a financial incentive to keep mining the old chain and extract the last bit of value out of it. And nobody can tell anyone not to trade the coin associated with the old chain. Let’s call that coin ETH POW. Exchanges like Poloniex have already stated that they will support this potential Ethereum POW coin:

*'Prior to the official ETH 2.0 upgrade, ETH holders on Poloniex can go to the swap page to swap their ETH into two ""potential forked"" tokens, ETHS \[IOU\] and ETHW \[IOU\], at a 1:1 ratio'.* 

So on an exchange like Poloniex, you can make sure that you will get both the old ETH POW token and the new Proof-of-Stake (POS) ETH token. And you could sell that ETH POW token on the market as you choose.

What if the Merge will complete without a fork? In that case, nothing happens. Poloniex will just keep the ETH symbol. *‘In this case, Poloniex will suspend and delist ETHS, ETHW, and their associated markets.’*

**Historical Parallels: Bitcoin Cash and Ethereum Classic**

Just look at the continuing existence of Ethereum Classic (ETC): it proves that old and unused chains can still have a price. Ethereum Classic, as the name suggests, was the original Ethereum.

After the DAO hack of 2016, Ethereum decided on a hard fork. All app development since, has happened on the new Ethereum chain, which we simply know as Ethereum. Still, ETC, the coin of the ‘ghost chain’ Ethereum Classic, trades at 40 dollars.

A hard fork is like an airdrop to holders of the original token. For example, people that held Bitcoin before the Bitcoin Cash hard fork in 2017, would automatically be ‘airdropped’ a similar amount of Bitcoin Cash. They could opt to hold or immediately sell.

As can be seen from the below graph, hodlers of BCH were not rewarded: since 2017, BCH has lost 95% of its value in Bitcoin terms.

The price history of Ethereum Classic (ETC) versus ETH has a very similar look. ETC has even dumped faster.

**Implications of an Ethereum Fork Post-Merge**

It is interesting to consider the intricacies of a fork. What happens in the background? Unlike the Bitcoin and Ethereum forks of the past, there is now a gigantic ecosystem of apps and tokens making use of the Ethereum blockchain.

If the miners continue to run the old chain, they will create a sort of parallel universe of sorts in which the Merge never happens. It will have the Ethereum-supported assets living on like ghost assets.

So in that science fiction sense, you will have twice the amount of USDC you owned before the Merge, and twice the amount of (Ethereum-based) NFT’s. But in practice, it won’t matter. The major players have signaled support for the POS chain.

For example, USDC, won’t recognize coins on the potential ‘parallel universe twin USDCs’ on the hard-forked POW chain as valid. The same goes for Chainlink, which has said it would not support any network that is a forked version of Ethereum.

*“Users should be aware that forked versions of the Ethereum blockchain, including PoW forks, will not be supported by the Chainlink protocol.”* 

**So What is the Potential Trade?**

After the Merge, all tokens on the POW chain will probably become worthless… except the Ethereum POW coins themselves. After all, it will be a functioning chain that offers a real alternative to POS Ethereum, which has its vulnerabilities.

The trade is generally speaking to buy ETH, loan ETH and then try to get your hands on the POW Tokens. Remove any ETH on Layer 2’s to the Ethereum main chain. If you own staked ETH, which is locked, then loan ETH against staked ETH. Why? In both cases, the Layer 2’s nor the stETH will be forked and hence won’t get the ETH POW ‘airdrop’.

So how do you get your hands on the ETH POW? There are two main ways. First, get them on centralized exchanges that recognize it. Second, buy them on decentralized exchanges.

**1. ETH POW on Centralized Exchanges**

If you want to trade a possible ETH POW coin, make sure you have an account on an exchange that will support the fork. As of now, we know the following exchanges will (this list could grow, of course):

* Poloniex
* BitMEX
* MEXC Global
* Gate.io
* OKX

**2. ETH POW on Decentralized Exchanges**

Another, more nerve-racking option would be to try to buy ETH POW on dexes like Curve or Uniswap. They might list the ETH POW tokens before cexes. It will possibly be a crowded trade, with liquidity pools that get drained of ETH POW right after the merge. See, that’s the irony: in order to dump ETH POW, first, everyone has to get their hands on it. This may lead to quite high prices.

**3. ETH POW on the Futures Market**

Another trade is the futures trade. BitMex has [listed ETHPOW futures](https://www.bitmex.com/app/trade/ETHPOWZ22). ETH POW has been trading in the 60 - 80 dollar range for a few weeks. No need to say that trading these futures is speculative. For a start, it isn’t even a certainty that the ETH POW token will exist at all.

**Conclusion**

For people who sit on the sidelines: get your popcorn, the markets after the Merge will be fun to watch. For those who want to trade: be careful out there. There are quite a few moving parts you’ll have to manage. Be prepared to get in a dog fight with trading bots.

Firstly, moving your coins to a cex always comes with a slight risk. If your exchange doesn’t support the potential fork(s), you’ll have to make an account on a different exchange, possibly one of lesser reputation. 

Second, always be aware of scammers that might want to lure you into fake trades. 

And to be clear: don’t expect the forked POW Ethereum to have lasting value. Even if the Merge won’t be an immediate technical success, issues will be fixed. In the long run, POW Ethereum will trend down in terms of ETH POS. The ETH POW token might spike to decent values though right after the Merge. 

Even though trading is fine, DON’T INTERACT WITH THE HARD FORKED CHAIN. There is a danger of so-called replay attacks, meaning duplicate transactions on the POS chain. Imagine sending ETH POW to someone and them duplicating the same transaction in the POS chain! You will have sent your POS ETH without intending it. 

If you want to trade, be in for a rough ride immediately after the Merge. The first minutes and hours after the Merge, buying and selling ETH POW tokens will be a crowded trade. Probably, it will be easier for centralized exchanges (cexes) to handle the volumes than for dexes. On dexes, you will be troubled by spikes in gas fees.",46.0,2022-08-30 07:43:56,0.82
Friendly reminder of the upcoming Ethereum Merge.,"As previously discussed, the Ethereum merge is coming up on September 15. The Ethereum Merge is a network upgrade that will change Ethereum's current consensus mechanism from ""Proof-of-work"" to ""Proof-of-stake"". What this potentially means for our beloved stock can be found in this excellent writeup by u/jango_bets. Here is the ETH snippet. 

***THE ETHEREUM MERGE***

*IMO this is the biggest catalyst we’ve had since the discovery of DRS. Ethereum is the backbone of the alternative financial system, the Fed Killer if you will. GameStop has been waiting on this and has positioned itself to be the go-to Marketplace that will be home to ALL Intellectual Property. Games, Movies, Music, Art, Podcasts, and potentially tokenized securities.*

*The Merge is the transition from Proof of Work (crazy energy cost like C eye A buttcoin) to Proof of Stake. In the smoothest of summaries this means:*

1. *Cheaper to use*
2. *Faster*
3. *More Secure*
4. *99.9% more environment friendly*
5. *Staking rewards*
6. *No mining-sell pressure*

*This is a massive transition that has been many years in the making. With everyone in the world besides us hoping GameStop will fail, it only makes sense they would wait for its blockchain to be fully functional and upgraded before releasing.*

*Here’s more info concerning the merge:* [*https://ethereum.org/en/upgrades/merge/*](https://ethereum.org/en/upgrades/merge/)

Get Ready For a Big Move,"I could start with the fact that Fed chair Powell said ""fight against inflation expected to bring to pain"" likely alluding to continued rate hikes. I could speak about Wall Street increased adoption of and pivot toward cryptocurrency. Or I could go no at length about the uncertain regulatory atmosphere. But increased of talking about what *might* happen based on what individuals say, we will dive into what the market and investors are actually doing.

Firstly, the market cap of crypto in general has fallen to about 50% of what it was at the beginning of 2022.

&#x200B;

[CMC Market Cap Data](https://preview.redd.it/oxsptch4onk91.png?width=1496&format=png&auto=webp&s=9bb157f5bd400b05ce6c8be3af4c94e7ffb983ee)

Further, the volume of trades has managed to remain fairly consistent with a slight increase in the past few weeks. This trend is consistent across both major exchanges as well as Paxful and Localbitcoins as a proxy for developing countries interest in cryptocurrency.

&#x200B;

[Local Bitcoins Volume](https://preview.redd.it/w1y7vk58vnk91.png?width=907&format=png&auto=webp&s=e4051236a5b513292a71e22511d0857241d87dd9)

However, we continue you see the value of the currencies of virtually all developing countries fall against the US dollar. This is in addition to the vast majority of major(developed countries) currencies fall as well. This is with the exception of the Mexican Peso, of whose Central Bank took pre-emptive steps to secure its own currency ahead of the Fed own rate hikes. The Mexican Central Bank voted to deliver the largest rate raise ever back in June with further rates increased expected(Per Bloomberg). Most other countries' rate increases are after the Fed's. if done at all, which tends to have their values fall against the dollar. The Russian Ruble is another exception for...fairly obvious reasons.

The rise in the USD is also indicative of economic fears as seen by the [mass lay-offs](https://www.forbes.com/sites/brianbushard/2022/08/26/datarobot-us-express-announce-layoffs-here-are-the-major-us-job-cuts-amid-growing-recession-fears/?sh=39326cb32f05) that I had highlighted in a earlier post, massive falls in stock prices and the rise in US treasury yields. I will explain how treasury yields work, lay-offs and stock valuation decreases due to economic fears are fairly obvious I think.

Treasuries(class of bonds) are seen as a safety trade and are the foremost part of easily one of the largest class of assets that attract the wealthiest and most sophisticated investors which includes both your large Wall Street-like firms as well as virtually every country on earth. For reference, the size of the US bond market is comparable in size to the entirety of the US stock market, if not actually larger. If you want any sort of solid grasp of the economy treasury yields should be quite literally your first choice or second in the worst case.

The price of a treasury travels inversely to its yield. So when demand for treasuries is high, treasury prices rise (and yields fall) and when demand is low the prices fall(and yields rise). Now in the face of an weak economy we would expect yields to fall as demand increases. **However,** we are in a place where treasury yields are lower than inflation thus making treasuries a losing trade by default. Also people believe inflation to continue to the for at least a couple months as hinted by the Fed. So we are actually see a huge sell-off in bond yields since the start of 2022 and again very recently.

We could say that all this large amounts of capital is moving from treasuries to cash(USD). This would make sense as as stock/equity prices fall  to sell them. However, there is also the added problem of inflation. Keeping your money in cash means losing \~8% of it to inflation. I mean to say that investors have very few choices. The treasury sell-off also implies that investors expected the Fed to reverse their course and start cutting interest rates, which certainly seems unlikely based of the most recent speech by the Fed chair a few days ago. And so, as expected, we see a sharp rise in the price of gold, which is a trade for uncertainty, that is, the between the rock of a weakening economy and the hard place of inflation.

*Note: the price spike took until this(Monday) morning to occur as most markets are closed over the weekend and open around 9-ish on Monday.*

Now the question is, can crypto benefit from the major sell-offs in assets. I expect at least some investors to consider it a good time as any to buy the dip since they have free capital from their sales and crypto is probably an amazing investment in the long term. To say that these investors would amount to enough to significantly affect the price of crypto is another big question of its own. We are certainly seeing increased interest in Bitcoin and Ethereum through the Open Interest indicators.

&#x200B;

[Eth Open Interest](https://preview.redd.it/hebio29s6ok91.png?width=1301&format=png&auto=webp&s=77647303c3cd20cc278738b3e0b136118676d58f)

Open interest broadly refers to investors who have bought some derivative contract of the token, which are usually put or call options and futures as well. Put or call options refers to the option fo an investor to sell or buy a token(or stock) at a particular price by some particular date. Now the open interest in ETH,at least, is likely speculation on the price after the merge, and it seems the BTC open interest is speculation *on the ETH speculation.* We can infer this as the correlation of the charts is pretty high. And between the two, they account for around 57% of the entire crypto market capitalization.

What I mean to say by all this is big things are coming. It would be fair to caution that even with seemingly increased crypto interest, it is quite possible that these traders are looking to snag a quick buck and sell as soon as the price spikes. This year however, crypto has slowly been seeing an increasing as a potential hedge to stocks as it increases a correlation to gold but we are still as ways away, but who can say. it would be fair to say the coming months are going to decide quite a lot.

There's more to come. Take care out there guys.

Tectum™ is a distributed ledger protocol platform that employs what’s known as a proprietary record change signature management algorithm. The Tectum Blockchain has the ability to exceed 1 million transactions per second and can provide instant event status delivery and ownership updates across its blockchain network along with differing distributed levels of access to functional system modules.  
The Tectum blockchain employs a proprietary Proof-of-Utility Consensus and a super-fast Network Protocol, the description of which can be found in our ‘Tectum White Paper’. Its Proof-of-Utility protocol optimises data distribution, and its Network Protocol enables nodes to distribute and validate over 1 million digital events per second. These functions make Tectum the perfect solution as an “Overlay Network” for numerous blockchain-based payment systems, for example, Bitcoin. When applied, Tectum boosts the circulation of native cryptocurrencies by eliminating transaction fees using what we refer to as the transaction-less Payment System’ – the SoftNote.

**THE TRANSACTIONLESS FUTURE**

The SoftNote is the flagship product of the Tectum blockchain and is regarded as the first ‘transactionless’ payment system boasting truly instant payment capabilities and a zero-fee policy for an end-user. A Transactionless payment is defined as one which does not involve a recorded transaction on a blockchain.  
The SoftNote has adopted many traditional ‘physical cash’ elements, for example, a Bitcoin SoftNote bill can be printed on paper, does not require a confirmation from the Bitcoin network, incurs no fees, and has no geographical boundaries. Therefore, the SoftNote can be used as a means of person-to-person payment or sent over any messenger application as a picture file. Unlike physical cash, however, a SoftNote is secured by a passcode rendering it useless to an unauthorised possessor. SoftNotes make it possible to implement traditional ‘Physical Cash’ liberties into a payment procedure by isolating a sender from the recipient as they replace a “transaction” with a ‘handover’ process.

DTTC testing private blockchain?????? Really??? The vertigo is making me nauseous.,"Going to dm Dr. T.  Has anyone one else heard about this??

## Silent Wall Street Giant Wades Into Blockchain Tech

Today 12:16 PM ET (Benzinga)Print

Ethereum  (CRYPTO: ETH) rode the momentum of the upcoming Merge—which has been  confirmed to begin September 6—to battle its way back to the 1,700 level  this week.

Global asset management giant Invesco has its eyes on  web3 with the launch of Invesco Metaverse Fund this week. The $30  million fund will be actively managed and invest in 7 key areas,  including next-gen operating and computer systems, hardware and devices,  and networks.

Meanwhile, Sharktank’s Mark Cuban is taking swipes  at Gary Gensler and the SEC. Cuban claims the agency has made it “near  impossible” for the industry to get any sort of clarity—he’s not wrong!

And  finally, audited financials revealed revenue growth of more than 1,000%  for FTX (CRYPTO: FTT) in 2021 after increasing sales from $89 million  to $1.02 billion! More on Sam Bankman-Fried (SBF) and FTX below.

1. Silent Wall Street giant wades into blockchain tech
2. Distributed ledger technology is having its moment
3. There are always strings attached
4. Silent Wall Street giant wades into blockchain tech

One of crypto’s biggest milestones is quietly being achieved by one of Wall Street’s silent giants.

The  Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation (DTCC)—which processes  virtually every trade you and I make—is live testing a private  blockchain, Project Ion, on which it is processing over 100,000 equity  transactions a day.

Why is this a big deal?

Trade  settlements currently take \~2 days, during which DTCC requires  collateral to be put up in the event of an “oh shit” scenario like the  one we saw play out with Robinhood (NASDAQ: HOOD) and GameStop (NYSE:  GME).

In this example, Robinhood was unable to put up the  collateral which forced it to halt trading and the rest is meme-stock  history.

With Project Ion, such debacles would be avoided as settlements would occur on the same day they are executed, like crypto.

The  former president of the New York Stock Exchange was quoted this week  saying, “blockchain technology is going to rewire all financial  services”.

This is just one of many dominos.

2. Distributed ledger technology is having its moment

Continuing this theme: DTCC is not the only one working to integrate blockchain technology into its business—not by a long shot.

Despite  the challenges posed by regulatory uncertainty surrounding risk  management, custody, and collateral rules that are still under  development, the fact is that none of Wall Street’s giants want to risk  being left behind.

Not to be outdone by JPMorgan’s  blockchain-based platform, Onyx, Goldman Sachs is building its own  distributed ledger technology network it says will lower the risk  associated with trading partners and make shares and other assets easier  to track.

The bank expects to utilize the platform to serve  itself and its clients, with the possibility of supporting other banks  (as Onyx does).

Like the DTCC move, this has major potential to  cut down settlement times which both reduce counterparty risks and frees  up capital that would otherwise be locked up.

3. There are always strings attached

Back  at the beginning of July, FTX tossed BlockFi a $400 million lifeline  which included an option to acquire…with strings attached.

According  to CoinDesk, the SBF-led crypto giant could end up purchasing the  struggling lender for as little as $15 million…or as much as $240  million.

It all comes down to a few specific performance targets:

* An additional $25 million if BlockFi wins S-1 registration from the SEC by December 31st
* Another $100 million if BlockFi reaches $10 billion in client assets by October 2023 (when FTX can exercise)
* An amount equal to 25% of BlockFi’s annual operating income

Regarding the second point: BlockFi held roughly $4.4 billion in assets at the end of Q2.

Regarding the third: the company lost money in 2020 and 2021 and is projecting a loss for 2022.

All signs point to a fantastic 2023 for SBF!",124.0,2022-08-26 20:51:53,0.92

The crypto trilemma explained - who will find the holy grail of cryptocurrencies?,"(English is not my first language so please be gentle)

No matter what blockchain you are commited to, nobody solved the trilemma so far (a lot of devs and fans will tell you they did, but this is questionable). The considered most secure blockchain (and decentralization is a huge chunk of that) is Bitcoin. It's not the fastest nor the cheapest nor scalable. We have fast / scalable blockchains, but they are criticized to fall behind in decentralization.

You can read the whole article about it [here](https://ethereum.org/en/upgrades/vision/#main-content). I'm not an ETH maxi and this is not a shill, but they are pretty honest about it and the explanation on their site is simply well done.

# The crypto trilemma explained

This diagram shows what all this is about - Ethereum is pictured in the middle, because that's where the foundation wants Ethereum to be in the future. Most of you may have another opinion on this, especially post merge:

[Source for this post: ethereum.org](https://preview.redd.it/vd3jayqqj0k91.png?width=504&format=png&auto=webp&s=451d20f17b476130c27eb4607f52de64eeb4ddf7)

We seem to have to chose between three options right now:

1. ""**Scalable and secure** \- Increasing the size and power of Ethereum's nodes could increase transactions per second in a secure way, but the hardware requirement would restrict who could do it - this threatens decentralization. It's hoped that sharding and proof-of-stake will allow Ethereum to scale by increasing the amount of nodes, not node size.""
2. ""**Secure and decentralized** \- Secure and decentralized blockchain networks require every node to verify every transaction processed by the chain. This amount of work limits the number of transactions that can happen at any one given time. Decentralized and secure reflects the Ethereum chain today.""
3. ""**Decentralized and scalable** \- Decentralized networks work by sending information about transactions across nodes - the whole network needs to know about any state change. Scaling transactions per second across a decentralized network poses security risks because the more transactions, the longer the delay, the higher the probability of attack while information is in flight.""

Where do you see which coin? Bitcoin for example seems to be #2, Binance Smart Chain is #1 but what could be a good example for #3?

Do you think there is a project that might solve the trilemma?",57.0,2022-08-26 07:51:53,0.75
Mark Cuban counts himself among supporters of the upcoming Ethereum merge,"Billionaire Mark Cuban counts himself among supporters of the upcoming Ethereum “merge,” a highly anticipated upgrade for the blockchain that will dramatically reduce its ecological footprint.

“I’m a fan of the merge,” Cuban, a Shark Tank investor and owner of the Dallas Mavericks, tells Fortune. “I think the energy usage issue is important.”

Indeed, the merge—estimated to happen Sept. 15—will shift Ethereum from a proof-of-work consensus mechanism to proof of stake. Proof of work is an energy-intensive process that relies on miners to add new blocks and verify transactions, whereas proof of stake instead relies on a network of validators. In turn, once the merge happens, mining on Ethereum will be effectively eliminated, and its overall energy consumption is expected to decline by 99.9%.

That’s why Cuban said he sees the move to proof of stake as a positive.

“But it’s long term. I don’t \[know\] if and when it goes up,” he added.

Even still, “I think the applications to drive usage will be there,” Cuban said, adding that he remains super bullish on Ethereum.

When previously discussing his affinity for Ethereum, Cuban has repeatedly mentioned the network’s applications and use cases being a driver behind his support. Mainly, he’s talked about his interest in smart contracts—collections of code that execute a set of instructions on a blockchain. 

“What really changed everything was smart contracts,” he said in March 2021. “Smart contracts came along, and that created DeFi \[decentralized finance\] and NFTs \[or non-fungible tokens\]. That’s what changed the game. That’s what got me excited. That’s why it’s a lot like the internet.”

Cuban owns Ether, along with other cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and the meme-inspired Dogecoin. His portfolio also consists of a few NFTs and investments in blockchain companies, many related to bettering Ethereum.

(Post Merge) Which GPUs will be obsolete first?,"Like with Bitcoin, at some point lower end GPUs were phased out by newer GPUs, which were ultimately phased out by ASICs. Obviously the Merge will wipe GPUs off Ethereum completely. With that, all other coins will find such a higher level of difficulty that will phase out a whole Series of GPUs. 

My question is which series will those be? RX 5000 Series? GTX 1000 Series? RTX 2000 Series? Which do you think will hash so low their hashrate won't even matter?",25.0,2022-08-25 15:39:19,0.84
Sharding will make Ethereum unrecognizable by the end of 2023," The major issue and main criticism with Ethereum has always been gas fees and traffic.

We all love Ethereum. Its is the home of our favorite projects, but the fact remains that it is one of the least efficient blockchain to build anything on.

However, with talks about the merge happening in September and the development of sharding following right after, this will all most probably change by a 180 degree.

Sharding will make Ethereum indistinguishable from the one we have today. Gas fees will become irrelevant and proover durations will be cut down dramatically.

I must say though, that Ethereum itself won’t scale and that only L2s will be upgraded by the implementation of sharding.

But this shouldn’t be a problem at all. Ethereum’s devs know exactly what they’re doing.

L2s on Ethereum have the right infrastructure to support sharding and to some extent are even more equipped and ready than the Ethereum blockchain itself.

Many L2s like Arbitrum and Optimism already have very fast and efficient tech.

Better yet, some L2s like Zksync are focused on zero-knowledge proofs which will supposedly be the future of Ethereum based on Vitalik

Zksync also already has a zkEVM testnet that is operational and they’re also launching a DAO specific scaling solution with the funding and help if BitDAO.

So taking all of this into consideration, I’m not really that worried about L2s taking the responsibility of scaling the Ethereum blockchain.

Can you imagine an Ethereum where you don’t have to worry about gas price or validation time? It sounds very weird and to some extent surreal to me but we’ll get there eventually. And it should take that much time. Apparently towards the mid/end of 2023, sharding would have been implemented completely on the beacon chain!",30.0,2022-08-25 08:02:32,0.92
GUIDE for Existing Stakers: Switch EL from Geth to Besu + Get merge-ready,"So I have been on the Geth Execution Layer client + Lighthouse Consensus Layer client combo for some time now. Back then I was happy I chose Lighthouse instead of Prysm (Prysm had 60% share, LH was 10% or so). But as a noob I was too afraid to try anything other than Geth. Back then Besu had bugs in its new Bonsai feature, Erigon was and still is on alpha, I didn't know anything about Nethermind.

Now Geth has 75% share among EL clients, and if a catastrophic bug brings down your validator along with 3/4ths of the network, you are going to be heavily penalized (inactivity leak becomes exponentially higher when the majority of the network is offline).

So the recent DB corrupting bug in Geth + Besu maturing and having AUTO online self-pruning + now is a good time to do all this without any downtime whatsoever (Infura fallback not possible post-merge), have all together spurred me into action and I have switched to Besu!

If you were a noob existing staker, you probably used Somer Esat's excellent guides like me. He has now kindly made a guide just for this group, but some adjustments are needed if you also want to switch ELs. So I cobbled together different commands to switch from Geth to Lighthouse and become merge-ready at the same time. Hope this is of some use  to other fellow beginner home stakers and many thanks to Somer Esat, the community here, the ethstaker discord, & /r/ETHFinance.

**IMPORTANT NOTES:**

1. Before you start, make sure you have at least 700 GB free space on your drive (as of Aug 26th, this will keep rising at around 2GB/day). If you don't, either prune Geth or if you have a 1TB SSD, get a bigger 2 TB + SSD, clone the drive & then prune Geth.
2. If you are using a CL other than Lighthouse, please substitute with your CL's commands and service names.
3. Also ensure your PC will not automatically reboot to install software updates etc - this can screw up the Besu sync process. If you have configured unattended-upgrades, disable it temporarily.

**Step by step guide:**

1. Configure your Consensus Layer client to temporarily fall-back on Infura (attestations will work even if you don't, but fallback is needed for block proposals):

a. Stop Lighthouse BN and VC services:

>sudo systemctl stop lighthousevalidator  
>  
>sudo systemctl stop lighthousebeacon

b. Edit systemd Lighthouse beacon node service :

>sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/lighthousebeacon.service

and modify the --eth1-endpoints part after 'lighthouse bn' to match the text below (you get the URL from your infura.io dashboard after creating an Ethereum Web3 project). You can add more fallbacks from [https://ethereumnodes.com/](https://ethereumnodes.com/) , I added one below from MyEtherWallet also just in case Infura goes down.

>\--eth1-endpoints [http://127.0.0.1:8545,https://mainnet.infura.io/v3/(token](http://127.0.0.1:8545,https://mainnet.infura.io/v3/(token) goes here),[https://nodes.mewapi.io/rpc/eth](https://nodes.mewapi.io/rpc/eth)

c. Reload systemd:

>sudo systemctl daemon-reload

d. Start Lighthouse services (if not using LH, replace with your clients' service names):

>sudo systemctl start lighthousevalidator  
>  
>sudo systemctl start lighthousebeacon

2. Check if your Validator Client is still attesting properly on beaconcha.in, then:

a. Stop Geth

>sudo systemctl stop geth

b. Disable auto-restart-on-boot of Geth service (don’t delete!)

>sudo systemctl disable geth

3. Check if your Validator Client is still attesting properly on beaconcha.in. Also your Lighthouse validator log should frequently say (for other clients, check client docs/discord, for example Nimbus will not complain at all!):

>WARN Error connecting to eth1 node endpoint  action: trying fallbacks,  
>  
>INFO Fetched data from fallback fallback\_number: 1, service: deposit\_contract\_rpc

4. Then create the JWT secret - [Step 7 of SomerEsat's revised guide](https://someresat.medium.com/guide-to-staking-on-ethereum-ubuntu-lighthouse-773f5d982e03#381c)

5. Install, configure Besu for Merge & sync Besu - [Use SomerEsat's revised guide for syncing Besu from scratch](https://someresat.medium.com/guide-to-staking-on-ethereum-ubuntu-lighthouse-773f5d982e03#7987). In the service configuration:

a. Set timeout to 180 sec to prevent DB corruption on reboots. Add the following after the RestartSec=5 line

>TimeoutStopSec=180

b. Optional, for those with 32GB RAM- Set max heap size to 8GB. So you would set the ENVIRONMENT variable to  -Xmx8g. Optional because Besu will not use more than 1/4th of your total RAM if you don't specify this variable.

6. Wait for Besu to sync fully. Takes 20-40 hours depending on hardware etc (24 hours with an i5 NUC that has TurboBoost ON).

To check progress, run:

>sudo journalctl -fu besu

and compare the block mentioned after ""Completed importing chain segment"" to the latest block number at etherscan.io.

These are the folder sizes I got after sync (check with command *du*):

638GB    /var/lib/besu

\---- 3.7GB    /var/lib/besu/caches

\---- 634GB    /var/lib/besu/database

7. Check if your Validator Client is still attesting properly on beaconcha.in, then:

a. Delete geth.service:

>sudo rm /etc/systemd/system/geth.service  
>  
>sudo rm /usr/lib/systemd/system/geth.service  
>  
>sudo systemctl daemon-reload  
>  
>sudo systemctl reset-failed

b. Delete geth directory:

>sudo -u goeth geth removedb --datadir /var/lib/goethereum

If this fails, try rm -r /var/lib/goethereum and to be sure, go to Ubuntu GUI and delete the folder manually if needed

c. Uninstall Geth & its PPA (as installed using SomerEsat's older guide):

>sudo apt-get remove geth  
>  
>sudo add-apt-repository --remove ppa:ethereum/ethereum  
>  
>sudo apt autoremove

8. Update Lighthouse to latest version, configure, start Lighthouse - [Use SomerEsat's guide for existing stakers](https://someresat.medium.com/supplementary-guide-to-staking-on-ethereum-for-existing-stakers-57493678a460). Remember to remove the Infura fallback, it will be deprecated post-merge. If you want a redundant EL, you will need to run your another pair of EL & Beacon Node on a local machine, and specify that Beacon Node as the fallback BN in your sole validator client. Remember your validating keys should be on only 1 validator client at a time, to avoid getting slashed.

9. Check if your Validator Client is still attesting properly on beaconcha.in, you should also see confirmation in your BN/VC logs that it is merge-ready!

That's it, you are now contributing to client diversity using minority EL and CL clients, and are merge-ready!

Please let me know if you see any errors, or possible improvements.",51.0,2022-08-25 07:53:09,0.96

What does Ethereum’s move to PoS mean for Layer 2 solutions? Here’s all you need to know:,"One massive misconception is that Ethereum’s move from PoW to PoS will make Layer 2 solutions irrelevant and obsolete when the reality is the exact opposite of that.

Ethereum’s move to PoS is a major benefit for Layer 2 solutions because when Ethereum moves to the beacon chain (the chain when PoS will be implemented), it could later implement sharding on that chain.

To make it short, sharding won’t affect Ethereum itself. The main Ethereum chain will always have high gas fees. Sharding will however make give Layer 2s a major boost in throughput (anywhere from 10k to 100k !)

The main focus of sharding will be on Data Availability which is one of the main reasons why gas to so expensive on Ethereum.

Basically, Ethereum stores all information about every single transaction on the chain which takes up a lot of precious and expensive space.

Layer 2 scaling solutions will now be able to take care of that issue.

This is one of the main reasons I root for Polygon so hard because they already have a Data Availability scaling solution called Polygon Avail which will store data off chain and only present the needed data at the time being while also proving that all the other data is available whenever needed.

I think this gives Polygon a massive edge over its competitors (for now) because they’re already working in the end goal.

Now what does this mean for Layer 2s?

This means that aside from the fact that their token prices will most likely gain more value, these scaling solutions will be of major importance for the Ethereum ecosystem since they’ll technically be the ones fully responsible for scaling the new Ethereum model.

In short, these Layer 2 solutions will now become a part of Ethereum itself.

You might even say that Layer 2s are more excited about the merge than the Ethereum devs themselves. The merge itself won’t boost Layer 2s but it is the main building block for all the other upcoming upgrades that will indeed make Layer 2s a force to be reckoned with.",20.0,2022-08-24 05:06:45,0.94
Eth may be headed for a fork into a censored and uncensored chain after the Merge due to US sanctions,"In case you've been living under a rock, some backstory: About two weeks ago the US government issued OFAC sanctions against an Eth smart contract called Tornadocash that is basically a coin tumbler, used to hide the source of your crypto. US persons who are caught interacting with this smart contract are subject to criminal penalties including prison time. Anyone who is a US person or does business in the US is exposed to OFAC sanctions. A company based in the Cayman Islands for example could still be forced into compliance if its board members are US persons or they do business in the US.

After the merge, US based validators (PoS stakers) may be prevented from validating OFAC sanctioned transactions (e.g. tornadocash) if the US government says so. Currently it is unclear whether this is the case. Anyone exposed to these sanctions is likely err on the side of caution to avoid jail time. Example - ethermine have been censoring Tornadocash (sanctioned) transactions for a week already (Bitfly who own ethermine will also be operating validators after the merge - I'd take this as a good indicator of their expected approach to this post-merge).

There is a very large portion of the total Eth stake that would be exposed to these sanctions including some very large centralised actors such as Lido, Coinbase and Kraken. These 3 alone hold roughly 45% of all staked eth. Lido alone hold 31%. They can exit their stakes immediately up until the merge, when the rules on this change. After the merge there is an exit queue mechanism where only 44k eth can exit the validator set per day. If just lido and coinbase both try to exit it would take about 2 months for all the validators to be removed from the list of validators. Until you're removed from the list you are expected to validate and are subject to penalties if you don't.

These validators will be forced to either 
1. Violate OFAC sanctions, 
2. Censor the transactions, or 
3. Abstain on blocks with sanctioned transactions. 

The board of Lido, Coinbase etc. are not going to prison for the good of Ethereum so we can safely rule out option 1 - despite what they may say on twitter.

If they take option 2 and censor, their stakes will get slashed (they lose 50% of their customer's funds) and their validators get kicked off the network.

If they take option 3, abstaining, they will also bleed out due to a penalty called inactivity leak, losing 50% of customer funds, and get kicked off. Inactivity leak is normally a very minor penalty, however if more than 33% of validators are inactive it gets much more severe each day (because this prevents block finality) and after 21 days, 50% of funds will have been lost and you are kicked off. Because so many validators will be exposed to the sanctions it is highly likely the severe leak penalty will be applied if they are all abstaining.

Proof of Stake works a little different to PoW - in PoS validators must attest both to transactions in the current block and in previous blocks. It could be very hard for US based validators to avoid attesting to any sanctioned transactions.

The 4th option is to fork into a censored ethereum chain. It is very likely that their customers will start screaming for this when they see their eth stakes melting due to penalties (slashing/leaking).

The Ethereum Foundation's response to this issue? ""This is why we recommended against using centralised staking pools."" They have also confirmed they are strongly against censorship and anyone who censors will get slashed. In short, they aren't going to do anything of substance to prevent this.

If US validators fork off into censored-eth, taking a copy of eth's defi system, stablecoin operators will have to choose a chain to support with their collateral. Unfortunately, it is again very likely that Circle, and probably Tether also, will opt to support the censored chain - this is because, as we all know, a lot of the money in the market comes from the USA. Stablecoin operators are already in the spotlight and they would likely see even more intense scrutiny if they were to instead support the uncensored chain. Both Circle and Tether are exposed to US law.

On whichever chain the stablecoin operators abandon, the entire defi system will basically implode. Stables are used for collateral almost everywhere you look. They will become worthless on the chain they abandon.

Unfortunately the OFAC sanctions have come at the perfect time for this to be a problem. Once the merge happens it is too late to prevent this because of the exit queue system in place for validators. The only way to 100% guarantee this scenario does not play out is for Lido, coinbase and Kraken to voluntarily exit their stakes before the merge. If the US decides to change the law after the merge and make this illegal for validators, the government has already won as there will be no way for Lido, Coinbase, Kraken and other centralised parties to avoid losing massive portions of customer's funds except by forking into a censored version of eth, where the US government will be able to keep pulling the strings.

Another issue with this is that the boards of these companies are legally obligated to act in the best interests of their companies (and not their customers, or ethereum). Lido essentially shutting their main business down flies directly in the face of this fiduciary obligation. It's hard to say how that will play out.

So we may be left with an uncensored eth that is in tatters because the stablecoins have abandoned that chain, and a censored chain that is essentially subject to the will of the US government - something Ethereum was specifically meant to avoid.

Right now the best thing we can do is look for ways to prevent this. I would start by campaigning for Lido, Coinbase, Kraken and other staking pools exposed to OFAC sanctions etc to exit their stakes ASAP

ELI5: A very real possibility that ETH may fork at or after the merge into two chains, dividing the eth community and perhaps (probably?) hurting the overall value of ETH; a censored, US-centric chain under the influence/control of the US government, and an uncensored chain that may be abandoned by stablecoins, effectively crashing defi on the uncensored chain. Only if Lido, Coinbase and Kraken exit their ETH stakes prior to the merge can we be certain this doesn't happen. This would be a result of recent US OFAC sanctions against Tornadocash.",333.0,2022-08-23 16:44:57,0.82

The Ethereum Merge and everything after,"  

 *The Ethereum Merge is by no means the final stage of Ethereum's journey. It's a crucial step but still won't help Ethereum scale right away. In a recent talk, founder Vitalik Buterin sketched the milestones and end goal. In short: 100 thousand transactions per second, without sacrificing decentralization.*

Buterin unfolded the Ethereum roadmap at a conference in Paris in July 2022. He claims the long-anticipated Merge will make Ethereum about 55% finished after the Merge is complete. So then what's left to do? The end goal is to dramatically increase capacity without ultimately turning Ethereum into a massive centralized database. This requires all sorts of crafty ways to compress data and outsource data storage away from the Beacon chain.

The Ethereum Merge is arguably the major milestone as it replaces Ethereum's 'engine': its consensus mechanism. On the surface, users will not spot the differences between before and after. We can think of the Merge as keeping the exterior of a car intact while replacing the combustion engine with an electric engine. No small feat!

All the steps that come after the Merge are less fundamental but no less important: they have to do with scalability. They ensure that Ethereum can process orders of magnitude more transactions. Those improvements have to do with revving up the engine.

#### Phase 1: The Merge 

The Ethereum Merge has been in the works for about seven years. The upgrade is all about the switch from proof-of-work to proof-of-stake. The Beacon chain, which has been tested for almost two years, will be merged with the old Ethereum blockchain. Mining will no longer be a business model in the Ethereum ecosystem and so Ethereum post-Merge will consume 99%+ less energy than before.

Also, from an investor’s perspective, Ethereum will change. Instead of miners securing the network, it will rely on ETH owners locking up some of their ETH as collateral to earn staking yields. Staking Ether becomes like an ""internet bond"" with the lowest risk of all Layer 1s. We’re dealing with a fundamentally different ‘economy’ here. After the Merge, Ethereum will no longer be a ‘mine-and-dump economy’ but a ‘stake-and-hold economy’. Whereas miners have to sell sooner or later to pay their bills, stakers benefit from staking as many ETH as possible: after all, compounded interest makes one wealthy.

The reason that Ethereum proponents are calling Ether ""ultra-sound money"" is that Ether will probably become deflationary after the Merge. Until the Merge, the block reward for miners is about 13,000 Ether per day. After the Merge, the new amount of ETH drops to just 1,500 per day. This 90% reduction corresponds to roughly three Bitcoin halvings. Hence, this deflationary move is also called the triple halving. Subtract from that the roughly 8,000 ETH burned per day, and your back-of-the-napkin calculus will tell you that the amount of existing ETH will decrease by roughly 1-2% per year. 

#### Phase 2: The Surge

No, the Surge is not about the expected rise in the price of Ethereum... It’s all about scaling. As Vitalik Buterin said in a July 2022 interview:

*""You can lose a billion dollars from a hack but you can also lose a billion from everybody needing to pay way higher fees than they have to.""*

Scaling of many orders of magnitude is essential if Ethereum wants to support a decentralized ‘world computer’ that supports thousands of apps *and* that is affordable to use.

When Surge? After a hopefully successful Merge, work on the Surge will begin. Completion of the Surge is expected in 2023 but of course, there are no guarantees. 

The letter S in the wordplay on Merge refers to Sharding: the parallel existence of 64 blockchains or shards. This divides the huge data load that Ethereum will face (and already faces). All this data can of course not be crammed onto a single blockchain, because no one would be able to run an Ethereum node anymore. So to avoid throwing decentralization out of the window, Ethereum has to divide and conquer.

Of all 64 shards, the Beacon Chain - as the name suggests - will be the one that other shards rely on. The Beacon chain is often compared to the highway and the other shards to side roads. That’s one way to visualize it, as it conveys the image of spreading the traffic load. But this comparison misses the point that the shards will most likely not process transactions. Instead, they are used to store transaction data. So a more apt comparison would be that of the Beacon chain as the production line of the factory and the shards as data warehouses (even though it’s still a possibility that some shards will get execution rights).

Despite being (mostly) ‘just’ data warehouses, the shard chains will offer big improvements to transactions per second when combined with rollups. This is where so-called Danksharding comes in.

**Danksharding**

A few technical approaches have been suggested to take data load away from the Beacon chain. The details still have to be fleshed out. Danksharding is now the most likely candidate: it’s named after the developer who proposed it (Dankrad).

Danksharding works with ""data availability sampling,"" a technique that allows nodes on Ethereum to verify large amounts of data by sampling only a few pieces. It’s an efficiency measure and it is well-suited for the rollup era. Rollups, like sidechains, take the pressure off Ethereum by performing transactions on a separate, layer 2 chain.

#### Phase 3: The Verge 

The Verge will introduce Verkle trees, yet another means to scale with greater efficiency. In Buterin's view, the Verge is ""great for decentralization.""

Verkle trees are of course a pun on Merkle trees, which are already used in Bitcoin and Ethereum. Merkle trees are a tool for ensuring reliable encryption by turning blocks of information into long strings of code. By adding all transactions in a block and creating a fingerprint of the entire set, it allows you to verify whether a transaction is included in the block. Verkle trees, in other words, make it possible to store a large amount of data by showing a short proof of any piece of that data. So they make the process of proof efficient. In this way, Verkle trees are a powerful upgrade to Merkle proofs. They will allow users to be network validators without having to store large amounts of data on their hard drives. Keep it decentralized!

#### Phase 4: The Purge

The Purge is about removing (""purging"") old data from the Ethereum blockchain. Again, this will alleviate the data storage requirements for users who want to be validators but who do not have hundreds of Terabytes available.

After the Purge, Ethereum clients will discard data older than a year. This should minimize chain clogging and allow many more transactions to be processed. Buterin expects Ethereum to process 100,000 transactions per second after the implementation of The Purge.

Ethereum devs will still have to figure out where all those old blockchain data will go. Even though they are ‘old’, they are still vital to all kinds of applications. Where do all those hundreds of terabytes of essential transaction data go? One option is Arweave, the protocol created with the explicit goal of making centuries-long data storage possible. Arweave already stores the entire blockchains of Solana and Avalanche.

#### Phase 5: The Splurge

According to Vitalik, the Splurge is all about the ""fun stuff"". Let’s see what techniques the dev team will come up with to further scale and speed up the Ethereum ecosystem, without sacrificing decentralization. ",77.0,2022-08-23 08:53:16,0.96

Lighthouse v3.0.0 (Rick Prime),"Hi ethstakers,
  
  We've published a new Lighthouse release 🐼 

https://github.com/sigp/lighthouse/releases/tag/v3.0.0

This is our merge release! **All mainnet users must upgrade to this release** (or a subsequent release) before the Bellatrix fork on Sept 6, 2022, 11:34:47am UTC.

Users who fail to upgrade their nodes before the Bellatrix fork (September 6th) will stop following the canonical chain. We recommend upgrading to v3.0.0 at your earliest convenience.

In addition to upgrading to v3.0.0 (or later), users will also need to make other changes to their nodes. These changes will be familiar to Goerli/Prater users. For more information, please see our [Merge Migration](https://lighthouse-book.sigmaprime.io/merge-migration.html) documentation.

Users will also be required to ensure that their ""execution layer"" client (i.e. Besu, Erigon, Geth or Nethermind) is also on a version with the latest merge parameters. We expect all consensus and execution layer clients to have merge-ready releases by 2022-08-23 (UTC). We recommend that users who are already using the `--execution-endpoint` flag to wait until their execution layer client has released a merge-compatible release and update both clients together. Updating Lighthouse before the execution layer is not harmful, but it will result in noisy ExchangeTransitionConfigurationFailed errors. The Ethereum Foundation is expected to publish an announcement on 2022-08-23 (UTC) with detailed information about which client releases are mainnet-ready.

There's a special message in the release notes for those who have helped Lighthouse become what it is today ❤️ 

It's been an incredible journey and I look forward to continuing it with you all.

Thanks and happy merging! 🐼❤️🎉🐼",86.0,2022-08-22 07:58:32,0.98
"Ethereum team debunked the claim that staking rewards will triple post-Merge. They noted that there would only be an increase of 50%. Therefore, going forward we can expect 6% APR for Validators post-Merge, about 5% at centralized staking platforms like Coinbase. Stack, Stake and HODL ETH!!! GLTA!!!","Furthermore,  conclusively, the Ethereum team noted that the Merge would not result in any downtime in the network. They said Ethereum would switch to PoS without recording any network downtime.

I'm currently long-term 205+ ETH, all staked at 3.28% APY in ETH2 rewards (expecting net 4.4% APY in 2023), and HODL 2030 to riches!

Censorship and a potential fork (not powchain) after the Merge that may have serious consequences - summary,"There's a lot of confusion on this subject so I thought this would be worth posting.

After the merge, US based validators (PoS stakers) may be prevented from validating OFAC sanctioned transactions (e.g. tornadocash) if the US government decides so. Currently it is unclear whether this is the case. Anyone exposed to these sanctions will err on the side of caution to avoid jail time. Example - ethermine have been censoring TC sanctioned transactions for a week already (Bitfly who own ethermine will also be operating validators after the merge).

There is a very large portion of stake that would be exposed to these sanctions including some very large centralised actors such as Lido, Coinbase and Kraken. These 3 alone hold roughly 45% of all staked eth. There is not enough time for all of their stakes to exit the network due to the exit queue mechanism. If lido and coinbase both try to exit it would take about 2 months for all the validators to be removed from the list of validators. Until you're removed from the list you are expected to validate and are subject to penalties if you don't.

These validators will be forced to either 1. violate OFAC sanctions, 2. censor the transactions, or 3. abstain on blocks with sanctioned transactions. The board of Lido, Coinbase etc. are not going to prison for the good of Ethereum so we can safely rule out option 1 - despite what they may say on twitter.
If they take option 2 and censor, their stakes will get slashed (they lose 50% of their customer's funds) and their validators get kicked off the network.
If they take option 3 abstaining, they will also bleed out due to a penalty called inactivity leak, losing 50% of customer funds, and get kicked off. Inactivity leak is normally a very minor penalty, however if more than 33% of validators are inactive it gets much more severe (because this prevents block finality) and after 21 days, 50% of funds are lost and you are kicked off. Because so many validators will be exposed to the sanctions it is highly likely the severe leak penalty will be applied.

The 4th option is to fork into a censored ethereum chain. It is very likely that their customers will start screaming for this when they see their eth stakes melting due to penalties (slashing/leaking). Ok, so what you might ask, if they want to run off let them.

The problem is the stablecoins. If US validators fork off into censored-eth, the supply of USDC/USDT will have doubled, but Circle and Tether collateral has not. The stablecoin operators will have to choose a chain to support with their collateral. Unfortunately, it is again very likely that Circle, and probably Tether also, will opt to support the censored chain - this is because, as we all know, a lot of the money in the market comes from the USA. Stablecoin operators are already in the spotlight and they would likely see even more intense scrutiny if they were to instead support the uncensored chain. Both Circle and Tether are exposed to US law.

On whichever chain the stablecoin operators abandon, the entire defi system will immediately implode. Stables are used for collateral almost everywhere you look. They will become worthless on the chain they abandon.

Unfortunately the OFAC sanctions have come at the perfect time for this to be a problem It is too late to prevent this because of the exit queue system in place for validators, and the merge only being a month away. The only way to 100% guarantee this scenario does not play out is for the merge to be delayed again AND for Lido, coinbase and Kraken to voluntarily exit their stakes.
An issue with this is that their boards are legally obligated to act in the vests interests of their companies (and not their customers, or ethereum). Lido essentially shutting their business down flies directly in the face of this fiduciary obligation. It's hard to say how that will play out.

So we may be left with an uncensored eth that is in tatters because the stablecoins have abandoned that chain, and a censored chain that is essentially subject to the will of the US government - something Ethereum was specifically meant to avoid.

Right now the best thing we can do is look for ways to prevent this. I would start by campaigning for Lido etc to exit their stakes ASAP to prevent this situation. And unfortunately would ask the eth devs to push the merge back one last time for the greater good.",58.0,2022-08-21 02:39:39,0.74

How does this imminent ETH merge affect your DCA strategy?,"The majority of you must be aware that the big buzz in cryptospace right now is the ETH merge. From the sources I read, the Merge will see the Ethereum mainnet merge with the Ethereum 2.0 Beacon Chain, which will complete the transition from proof-of-work (PoW) to a proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus mechanism. This PoS is then expected to make Ethereum more secure, energy efficient, and environmentally friendly - which is great news. 

This has caused me to reconsider my investment strategy, especially since we have just emerged from a bear market. With the current trend, ETH reaching 10-20k is very likely. HODLing + DCAing + Staking has always been my strategy. I'm not sure how everyone's strategy has changed as a result of this news. I've been considering upping my game by staking my ETH on more platforms such as Binance, Nexo, and Haru Invest.

The Effect of the Merge on Eth Supply," 

With the Merge about a month away, I wanted to analyze how we can expect the change to Proof of Stake to impact the circulating supply of ETH.

**Why is supply important?**

When supply rises, prices fall. When supply falls, prices rise. Water for irrigation will be much cheaper in a place where it rains a lot than in the middle of the desert. If you expect supply to fall you can expect price to increase if demand remands unchanged.

**The Merge will end 15,000 Eth a day in sell pressure**

Currently miners are paid Eth as incentive to burn computation, and most must sell that ETH quickly to pay power bills and operating costs. This dumps thousands of ETH a day on spot markets, driving down the price.

POS Eth will instead pay validators who stake ETH to secure the network. Currently there are 13.2 Million ETH staked, resulting in payments of 1650 ETH per day. The formula\* for this provides diminishing returns as more is staked, so even if 100 million Eth was staked only 4600 would be distributed per day. These stakers also do not have the same economic incentive to immediately sell the ETH they earn, as running a node costs almost nothing and they can restake ETH to continue to add to their gains.

**The Triple Halving**

The above issuance reduction is sometimes referred to as the triple halving, because it is the same supply drop as if the bitcoin mining reward halved three times. This is of particular note because bitcoin halvings have traditionally been associated with a meteoric rise in price.

**Eth might become deflationary**

Since the London Upgrade (EIP -1559) just over 1 year ago, an average of 7100 Eth per day in transaction fees have been burned by the protocol. If gas fees remain as high as they have been the past year, more ETH will be burned each day than is released to stakers.

**Staking ETH removes it from circulating supply**

Depositing ETH on the staking contract locks it into the protocol at least until the next network upgrade. It cannot be sold during this time, and even after the protocol is upgraded to withdrawals, only a certain number of withdrawals will be allowed each day to protect the network.

**stETH as an asset**

stETH is a derivative asset that some protocols give to represent underlying staked ETH. While the underlying ETH is locked up in staking, StETH can be staked in other protocols and freely bought and sold.

Once staking withdrawals are enabled, stETH tokens are redeemable at a 1 to 1 ratio for the staked ETH they represents. This is what gives stETH its value.

Currently stETH trades at .96 discount to ETH. This is largely due to Merge risks and because stETH is not yet redeemable for ETH, as unstaking will not be enabled until the next network upgrade at an undetermined later date. The staking contract also only allows so much ETH to be unstaked at a time.

After the Merge and subsequent withdrawal enabling fork, it is entirely possible that stETH will trade at a premium to ETH. Why?

**The stETH premium**

stETH retains much of the utility of ETH, while also giving the user the staking rewards from the underlying staked ETH.

If two tokens are functionally identical, and one pays a dividend of 7% a year while the other does not, we can expect the one that pays a dividend to be more expensive.

Of course, stETH and ETH are not fully identical. stETH Cannot be used as gas for the Ethereum network, and it cannot be exchanged for ETH until a future network upgrade.

It remains to be seen whether stETh will trade at a discount as it does currently, or at a premium if Merge risks disappear and withdrawals are enabled.

**The stETH abitrage trade**

What if stETH does trade at a premium to ETH due to the staking revenue stream it guarantees?

This would incentivizes people and bots to buy ETH, stake it for stETH, and sell the stETH for profit. This is known as an arbitrage trade: since ETH and stETH are always exchangeable at a rate of 1 to 1, this trade will always profit as long as stETH remains more expensive than ETH.

The arbitrage trade will be limited by the fact that as more and more ETH is staked, the staking reward rate will go down, resulting in a smaller premium in the price of stETH. Eventually enough ETH will be staked to where the profit an arbitrager makes from buying ETH and selling stETH is negated by the gas fees they must pay to the network.

This could result in massive amounts of ETH staked for stETH, further reducing the circulating supply of ETH in the market. For example, imagine if the equilibrium point where it is no longer to buy ETH, stake it, and sell stETH is when the staking rewards drop to 2%. To reach this level 68 Million ETH would have to be staked.

If the equilibrium point is 1.5%, the total ETH staked would be 122 million, greater than the 120 million total current supply.

This has the potential to massively cut the circulating supply of ETH and convert much of the ETH used in DeFi to stETH.

But since gas fees must be paid in ETH, there will always be demand for native ETH as long as the network is being used.

Shout out to [u/SquishChaos](https://www.reddit.com/u/SquishChaos/) on twitter for being the first person I saw talking about this. Check out his full 18 page analysis at [https://squish.substack.com/p/ethereum-moving-the-gas-underground?s=r](https://squish.substack.com/p/ethereum-moving-the-gas-underground?s=r)

**In summary**

The Merge will result in much fewer ETH distributed every day, and likely more ETH burned than is distributed.

Depending on the premium for stETH, much of the current circulating supply of ETH could be taken off the spot market and staked.

Most importantly, the Merge reduces ETH's massive carbon footprint and paves the way to future upgrades that will lower the network's transaction fees.

🏁We’ve surpassed 🍖55K $BONE holders! …on to 60K and beyond.,"# [🍖55K!](https://i.imgur.com/feogotd.jpg)  

…some studies show that, unless an achievement is sudden and life-changing, people are less likely to celebrate or even recognize a milestone because we spend our time comparing ourselves to others or focused on the things perceived to be going wrong, not just in the workplace but also in our personal lives. It’s one of the reasons why some go about their days thinking they haven’t accomplished much of anything when the opposite is true.  

***  
# Yesterday, we surpassed 🍖55K holders
** **55,131** as of this writing.  

### It wasn’t long ago that we were at 🍖25K holders or sitting at the 40-45¢ range for months. **$BONE is now at over $1**, with **Shibarium Public Beta TestNet** right around the corner.

Imagine what it will be like once we hit 60K, 75K, 100K holders! So make an exception today, give yourself some credit for getting this far, and celebrate this milestone along with me. What’s more is that you’re early, way early, at a time when all major projects are on the cusp of being released — every project that will run on **Shibarium** will require $BONE to cover gas fees.  

So celebrate your bag, no matter the size. [Will you be regretting the size of your bag when $BONE is at $100? How about at $200+?](https://www.marketcapof.com/bone-shibaswap/binancecoin)  

***  

### 🍖 People will flock to Shibarium to save on gas fees since Ethereum Foundation has already confirmed that The Merge won’t help reduce them.

### 🍖 Every transaction that runs through **Shibarium** will require $BONE to cover gas fees.

### 🍖 Every transaction on **ShibaSwap v2** will require $BONE to cover gas fees

### 🍖 Every transaction on **ShibaNet**, a decentralized marketplace, will require $BONE to cover gas fees

### 🍖 Every transaction on **SHIB: The Metaverse** will require $BONE to cover gas fees

### 🍖 All transactions on future blockchain games will require $BONE to cover gas fees.

### 🍖 $BONE locked in **Liquidity Pools** — value locked reduces circulating supply and, as a result, token price increases.

### 🍖 …and the list goes on, including future Partnershibs, especially from those who would also like to benefit from fast transactions and low gas fees by using **Shibarium**.  

***  

At **55,131** holders and growing, this is just the beginning. The more holders there are, the less effective whale Pump-and-Dumps become.

We’re just getting started…

Imagine the owner of a Welly’s restaurant who accepts $SHIB — the customer that just paid had to use $BONE to cover the transaction’s gas fees. After receiving payment, the owner converts it to $SHI (ShibaToken’s ecosystem stable coin due for release soon) to protect himself from price fluctuations  — to make this happen, the owner had to use $BONE to cover the gas fees of the swap.

At every step in that example a bit of $BONE was needed to settle each transfer. These are just 2 transactions. Now think of this happening across all places that accept $SHIB, be it online or offline. Now multiply that by every project or coin that will be transacting on **Shibarium**. Times every country that’s also doing it.

The possibility could be hundreds of thousands of transactions, millions of them, eventually tens of millions…per month, per week, per day — and when there has been sufficient growth to the Shiba Token ecosystem — per second…every one of them requiring a bit of $BONE to cover transaction fees.  

***  

👉 PS: The holder figure mentioned in this post only includes $BONE holders — the exact number that accounts for both $BONE and tBONE holders is **88,783** (+408 yesterday) per [ShibaZen who tweets his calculations daily.](https://twitter.com/shibazen1961/status/1560127232898543618?s=21&t=EtNq9CR1B8WRmVzougnaXA)

Why are people still comparing Bitcoin and Ethereum? They are simply not the same and can both be equally successful.,"Just as the Ethereum Merge is inching closer and ETH is pumping a lot due to the hype many are once again starting to compare Ethereum to Bitcoin and talk about ""The Flippening"". Why? Probably just because they are two OG cryptos and by far the most safe ones. There is literally no other similarity you can find here. They are very different from each other. 

While Bitcoin has been seen as a currency by most and even is accepted as one in some countries. Ethereum clearly is not a currency of you just look at the fees but even if the fees get lower, it's still not a currency. Ethereum is meant to be about smart contracts and decentralized applications in crypto and as we can see ETH had a very huge ecosystem around that. 

Comparing them both is stupid because at the end of the day both will prevail and be successful together and more importantly both are needed for Cryptos future.",382.0,2022-08-13 20:51:57,0.82
"A follow-up to my “what is the merge” post. This time let’s discuss the next upgrade after merging, “The Surge”.","As with the merge, the surge has more than one step to it but we’re only really interested in one important thing which is Sharding

Now before we understand what Sharding is we have to understand why Ethereum is so expensive and slow to use in the first place.

I expect that a lot of users here already know how the Ethereum bidding system works so you can skip this one right away if you want to

&#x200B;

# - Why is Ethereum so inefficient?

Ethereum currently runs on PoW (proof of work) meaning that all transactions are proven to be real by miners that solve very complicated computational problems for a small fee of course.

You as a user would obviously want your transaction to go through fast but Ethereum is a very popular chain and there are a lot of people ahead of you. For you to try and “skip ahead” of them, you’ll basically “tip” the validators a little bit more than others, and boom! You become their priority. So basically its a bidding game. Whoever is willing to “tip” more gets their transaction validated faster.

&#x200B;

# - Why does the merge come before the surge?

Think of Ethereum as a long stretch of road that has one single lane. It works well sometimes but when it gets congested, IT GETS CONGESTED…

This is exactly why the merge comes before all other upgrades.

Developers realized that Ethereum has great demand and the “road”  they created(which represents the blockchain)  needs a ton of new fixes. But fixing this “road” means that traffic will come to a complete halt and so will hundreds of billions of dollars in assets.

Therefore they created a completely different “road” which is the beacon chain and that chain has the capacity to undergo upgrades and development without having to stop traffic.

&#x200B;

# - What is Sharding and how does it work?

What Sharding will do is the equivalent of creating many more lanes (64 to be exact) on a brand new created road (the Beacon chain).

Ethereum can only process around 15 transactions per second and has maxed out once at only around 16 TPS. So it’s safe to say that Ethereum isn’t the fastest of blockchains. So developers came up with Sharding as a solution.

Sharding is an algorithmic process of splitting a blockchain up into many smaller pieces and, well, shards with many of these pieces overlapping and working in parallel. It is executed in a way that will allow anyone to verify their shard and still 100% trust the rest of the blockchain.

&#x200B;

# - Initial plans for Sharding and how they changed

The plan initially was the implement Sharding on the entire Ethereum blockchain (this includes the EVM, data, smart contracts, account, and everything else on the chain). However, Vitalik and the rest of the developers decided that it would be a better idea to implement Sharding on the data alone. This is why ***rollups will take over scaling and not the blockchain itself***

&#x200B;

# - The importance of L2s for the future of Ethereum

As I mentioned in the previous section, plans for Sharding changed and the responsibilities of scalability now fall on L2s (rollups basically).

Scaling solutions like Optimism, Immutable X, Arbitrum, Loopring and many more do all of their computations and storage offchain and end up posting data back to Ethereum

Without getting into a lot of technical details, Sharding will basically put these scaling solutions on Steriods

I mentioned in my previous post that I am in fact biased towards Polygon and some people in the comments genuinely asked as to why. Here is exactly why I’m biased towards them (by the way this does not mean that I think other scaling solutions are bad. I’m fond of many other scaling solutions and I always invite competition)

The most important feature of Sharding is data availability.

Right now there are Ethereum nodes. They’re essentially a bunch of computers that keep a fully comprehensive record of the entire blockchain. As you can imagine, this takes up A TON of precious and expensive space for data.

Well, it just so happens that Polygon already has a solution for that in the form of Polygon Avail. No other scaling solution has their current technology in that sector.

What Polygon Avail essentially does is solve the problem of data availability by storing data offchain and presenting only the needed data when actually needed

It basically shows Ethereum proof that “yes, the entire data is safe and sound. Here is the small amount of data you need right now” without having to burden Ethereum with the massive amounts of data that most of it won’t be used and will slow down the Ethereum network.

Again, I think competition is an amazing thing to have especially in a tech market like this one so I support all scaling solutions but as I said, I personally think Polygon has an edge over others.

&#x200B;

# - Some cool features that come with Sharding

This post is starting to get long so I’ll talk about one feature actually that I think is very cool but is also extremely important

Sharding will actually change the way that nodes are selected to validate each shard

I’ll throw in an example given by Vitalik.

Imagine there are 6,400 nodes and 64 Shards (the standard). Every time that a shard and a block need verification, the Beacon chain (new PoS chain) will select at random 100 nodes to validate a block and the same will happen for the next block and the one after that, and so on (all at random).

The cool and important thing about this all lies in security. An attacker will now find it much harder to attack the network because he will require a large portion of the network to do so and would need that for a much longer time now.

I hope this post was helpful and I’d love to answer any questions in the comments!

I enjoyed answering questions in the previous post and would love to make another post about the upgrade after the surge (the verge, or Merkle trees update) if it wins popular demand!",101.0,2022-08-12 16:18:43,0.9
Ethereum Merge: Explained like I am 5,"The upcoming Ethereum network merge is one of the most discussed, hyped and controversial topics recently and it's actually poorly understood by the majority of people within the blockchain space and outside of it. Even though some of you reading this probably have a basic or even advanced understanding of it, I will try to do an ELI5 version for those who have no idea what it means but would like to learn more about it. You can try reading Vitalik's blog posts but trust me, his blog posts can make a very smart person completely question their intelligence.

First of all, let's quickly explain **Proof-of-Work** and **Proof-of-Stake**. These are the consensus mechanisms used in distributed networks in order to keep them secured. In PoW, the network is secured by **miners** who are the ones who own the **mining hardware** and use electricity, in exchange for block rewards (ETH) and some transaction fees. In PoS, the network is secured by **validators** who have to **stake** their coins (ETH). Advantage: Electricity is reduced by **99%**.

Now, the main purpose of the merge, is to transition the PoW Ethereum chain to PoS in order to reduce energy waste, increase security and introduce sharding (let's leave this behind for now), all without disrupting the running network. So, imagine this:

A car is driving on the driveway. This car uses **gas as fuel** (PoW) and it carries millions of passengers (Network users; idk man it's a pretty big car). The goal of the merge is to change the engine of the car from **fuel to electricity** (PoS) **without the car having to stop and/or crash.** So as the car is on the road, the developers who are driving, have been developing an electric engine (PoS) for the past 1.5 years, in order to replace the current gas engine (PoW) with it. If it's successful, the engine will be changed without any passenger noticing. This means that users who are for example, liquidity providers on a DEX, will continue doing so after the merge is completed, without anyone noticing. If someone uses the AAVE protocol for a loan, nothing will be affected. It's a pretty big deal if the network manages to transition from ""gas to electricity"" without disruptions, as it will allow it to scale, be more secure and environmentally friendly without any user noticing. 

I hope this clears it up for some of you. I would love to write more about the benefits and risks of this milestone, as well as the future of the network but that would take days (probably until the actual merge). But if you liked it, I could write more about it next time.",78.0,2022-08-12 15:00:01,0.8
Ryan’s Warning. The Countdown has begun.,"EDIT: BBBY hit threshold on 8/16. BUCKLE TF UP!

Sup crayon munchers? My Mom just let me out of the basement for my daily hour of screen time, so let’s get to it. 

**TLDR:**

You have 34 days to DRS your shit 

&#x200B;

**DISCLAIMER**: This bit of tin-foil about tweet timing could mean nothing and wouldn’t change my thesis whatsoever, just want to give insight on how this smooth as a wet seal brain put this connection together. 

I think we can all agree Ryan’s purple heart tweet is a nod to DRS, but in true Reddit fashion, I had to give it a full 4-point inspection. The tweets are seemingly unrelated, so I focused as hard as I could to find out the time between tweets 10:11 – 9:37 = 34. *Yay math!* 

&#x200B;

**Why is 34 important? 2 things:**

1. Ethereum’s merge is scheduled to complete in 35 days

2. T+35 trade settlement 

“*But Jango, all those cycles never work out!”* Not so fast young Ape. I’m gonna take you back 84 years ago when you were still pissing the bed & suckling from your momma’s teet.

On 12/8/2020 GME entered the Reg-SHO threshold list. 35 days later the stock opened at $20.44 and rocketed up 90% to a high of $38.6 on 144,501,700 volume (2x shares outstanding) 

**Ok hold on, what’s Reg-SHO?**

It’s what keeps Hedgies up at night. Per Investopedia: [https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/regsho.asp](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/regsho.asp)

Now here’s the requirements on closing shorts. Our favorite Pomeranian u/Criand colored this for us many moons ago. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/fsxlnzt0g5h91.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=3c8ed58cbda4593062727e3c4854ed666982a6d8

There’s a ton of good research on Reg-SHO and it’s short comings by Dr. Trimbath, and I agree that like most of our financial system it is shit. It has proposed settlement dates of T+3, T+4, T+6, T+13, etc.. but AFAIK if the shorts ask “pwetty pweez can I haz some more time?” they are able to extend out to T+35. Longer it takes, the more I buy. Which leads us to the ticking time bomb, & RC’s ace in the hole: BBBY.

&#x200B;

**BBBY IS ABOUT TO HIT REG-SHO**

As we all know by now, at least some of the short position against GME is in a basket of brick & mortar co’s, including BBBY, leading RC to buy-in and profit off of SQZ without selling his GME shares. Using the most current fails data for July (Someone buy the SEC some fucking coffee so we can get this faster), I calculated an average fail rate of 4.03% daily volume. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/3okrchf2g5h91.png?width=791&format=png&auto=webp&s=6e06b3e2379071a52d949927ae04cabd3904b1e5

In the past 5 days, BBBY has traded entire shares outstanding almost 5X. If we apply a 4% fail rate to daily volume, this easily clears the benchmark of .5% fails of total shares to qualify for Reg-SHO. 

&#x200B;

[\\""Sir those are as good as stock, they're IOU's!\\""](https://preview.redd.it/xl3ynz34g5h91.png?width=866&format=png&auto=webp&s=ed24b8b7f4599007d8306ff96a1f38e1a8fc2acd)

If BBBY follows same path as GME, we should see a huge move up on September 15th. What happens after is uncharted territory, cuz ya know they turned the buy button off when this happened to GME..   
   
 

*But Jango, this is a GME sub, wut have to do with us?*  

Have you been living under a rock? OUR CHAIRMAN bought 9.8% of the company @ $15.34/ share, has a metric shit ton of calls, and he just kicked the CEO to the curb and brought on a whole new Board of Directors. Over 100% of the float is shorted (sound familiar?) Oh and the media is giving it the “Forget GameStop” treatment too:

&#x200B;

[How much coke you think this guy consumes on a daily basis?](https://preview.redd.it/wrzg1b97g5h91.png?width=972&format=png&auto=webp&s=79206c85cce8c1cce190ced89310d737b44e9ad9)

&#x200B;

[Seriously, how much coke?](https://preview.redd.it/8ujmh2x9g5h91.png?width=953&format=png&auto=webp&s=871cdbc45c8794cf74450e4459e7a520b14ae151)

In summary, I think BBBY is a huge part of RC’s master plan but this alone isn’t enough to trigger THE SQZ. Think of BBBY short settlement as Gohan lending his strength to Goku (GME) to drop the Spirit Bomb on Wall St cucks. Now what else did I say is happening September 15th? 

&#x200B;

**THE ETHEREUM MERGE**

IMO this is what GameStop has been waiting on before launching the full NFT Marketplace that will be home to ALL Intellectual Property. Ethereum is transitioning from Proof of Work (crazy energy cost like CIA buttcoin) to Proof of Stake. In the smoothest of summaries this means: 

1. Cheaper to use

2. Faster

3. More Secure

4. 99.9% more environment friendly

5. Staking rewards 

6. No mining-sell pressure

This is a massive transition that has been many years in the making. With everyone in the world besides us hoping GameStop will fail, it only makes sense they would wait for its blockchain to be fully functional before fully releasing their groundbreaking tech. Here’s more info concerning the merge:

[https://ethereum.org/en/upgrades/merge/](https://ethereum.org/en/upgrades/merge/)

&#x200B;

**Will this be enough to ignite the Mother of all SQZ?**

It damn well could be. If I’ve learned anything from this saga its: 

1. Don’t fuck with gamers 

2. Ryan Cohen most definitely does not have a small wee wee

3. Ask what you can do for your company

I believe the full launch of the marketplace will surpass even the highest of our expectations, and it’s very likely that it will be paired with something Wall St isn’t expecting. Tokenized stock exchange, spin off of GMErica, take your pick of theories.. Here’s one of my favorite DD’s from u/sharkbaitlol about the potential [https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/pe37k7/the\_gme\_warpath/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/pe37k7/the_gme_warpath/) 

&#x200B;

**Conclusion**

I believe RC has lit the beacon and gave the final warning to DRS. If you haven’t seen enough evidence of fuckery to DRS at least part of your position by now, then idk what to tell you. The music is stopping and Wall Street is about to be left holding the biggest bag of odorous excrement ever assembled in the history of capitalism.

Edit: To the “No dates” crowd, the ETH merger is literally happening 9/15. ETH is the Fed killer, the alternate financial system. GME is poised to be the go-to marketplace for all IP on the blockchain. Games, Music, Movies, Shows, Art, Podcasts, you name it. This is fucking happening wether the establishment likes it or not. ✌️",2773.0,2022-08-11 21:15:07,0.91
A beginners Guide to Cryptocurrency,"**What is a blockchain?**

It is an “immutable ledger.” Think about it like a book that lives in the sky. Every time something changes, its written down with magic ink, that when dries, never changes. And there are thousands of copies of these books, all getting updated at the same time. If one is ever messed with, the other books would wipe out the problem and replace it with the correct entry.

(Tedtalk – Blockchain Massively simplified)

**What is proof of Work?**

First generation crypto currency worked of the concept of Poof of work. There, it is a race to solve a complicated math puzzle, and perform the block write operation. And as a reward get coin. “Mining.” Mining is slow. Bitcoin can only do 7 transactions a minute.

Of the thousands and thousands of machines out there racing to win the next block, only 1 at a time wins. That means the others have literally wasted their energy via compute CPU and GPU cycles. Bitcoin used more energy than Argentina last year.  
But its not all bad. POW is still the oldest and most battle tested consensus algorithm, and many ague more secure because of it.

[https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/proof-work.asp](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/proof-work.asp)

[https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-56012952](https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-56012952)

**What is proof of Stake?**

Proof of Stake works on different types of newly developed “Consensus” algorithms. Ouroboros protocol, created by IHOK and Cardano, along with a team of PHDs and mathematicians, is the first of its kind. They created a secure “lottery” consensus mechanism to “elect” the next “slot leader” to write the block. Here each Stake pool can get a chance to be elected by winning the lottery. Each Ada coin represents 1 lottery ticket. When you delegate to the pool, you give that pool your ticket, not your coin. If the pool wins, you get the reward along with everyone in the pool, and the operator. Because there is no more complicated math puzzle, and no more computers racing to solve the puzzle, its much much faster, and much much cheaper. Cardano nodes can be run on Raspberry Pi.. A lot of nodes out there run on Solar energy. It’s so good, Ethereum, who is proof of work currently, is moving to this model as part of their ETH 2.0 migration. Hopefully this summer with the ""merge."" In efforts to reduce gas fees and energy concerns. Pokodot created its own Consensus algorithm. Called Grandpa. Tezos has its Emmy+, and the list goes on.

Each other their own way of doing things. But “gen 3” is not Proof of work.

What you should remember is that for both POW, POS, and others, they are all a means of incentivizing the actual people that run the computers hosting the blockchain code. Without them, there is no “decentralized network of immutable ledgers.” Which is because that’s just fancy talk for machines running our code to support the blockchain.

**What is Market Cap and coin supply and why should we care?**

Market Capitalization is equal to Price of Coin times Supply of Coin. That is, it. But very important.

BITCOIN has a fixed supply. It is not all mined yet. Not until 2140. But it does have a finite amount, 21 Million.

Here is why you can see a 65K or even 100K bitcoin, but you’ll probably never see a 100 dollar DOGE, or even a 30 Dollar Ada (not soon anyway)

Currently there are 19,118,581 BTC out there at a cost of 24,340.01.

That means, the market cap is 24,340.01 x 19,118,581 = 465,346,452,725.81 (465B)

Cardano, has a fixed coin supply as well. But it is 45 Billion. There are currently 33,739,028,516. So you see the max is 2500x more. Likewise, with 130B DOGE vs 18M BTC - it’s \~6700X more. DogeCoin also makes 10,000 new coins a minute.

At a price is .50 that means the market cap for Cardano is .5 X 33,739,028,516  =16,869,514,258 (16B)

You'll need a 1 Trillion Market Cap for Cardano to hit 30  
33,739,028,516 \* 30 = 1012170855480

To give you some reference. Here is the Market cap of some big names.

Visa – 499B

Adobe – 250B

Amazon – 1.7T

It’s very confusing because every coin has their own supply. Their own way of creating coins and at what cadence. Some even “burn” coins. So, know what yours does and how it works.

**How can I “get in early?”**

First. We are all early. You might not have gotten in on the first floor, but we’re only halfway up the stairs to the second flight.

Global wealth is estimated at 1 quadrillion. All the Market Cap in crypto is at 1.23 Trillion. That’s only 0.11% of the world’s wealth.

When looking for “what could be the next big thing” find something with a low market cap, regardless of coin price, that has a strong chance of doing well because of team and tech, the two Ts.

Also ask yourself.

What are these coins use cases?

Who is their target audience for adoption?

Who is funding them?

Who is their team building it? What is their history?

Do they have a good plan?

[https://river.com/learn/how-much-worlds-money-in-bitcoin/#:\~:text=Global%20wealth%20is%20estimated%20at,represents%200.09%25%20of%20global%20wealth](https://river.com/learn/how-much-worlds-money-in-bitcoin/#:~:text=Global%20wealth%20is%20estimated%20at,represents%200.09%25%20of%20global%20wealth).

**What are your goals?**

Crypto is really split into 4 worlds.

Day traders, H.O.D.L.’ers, Whales, and weak hands.

Day traders realize that this market is very volatile, now, and historically. Good ones, can capitalize on quick gains by buying low and selling high, waiting for a dip, then buying back in, and selling high again, cyclically.

Then there are those that “Hold On for Dear Life.” These people tend to find something they really are passionate about, and never sell. They keep buying. If they see their coin dips, below at what they bought it at, and have some extra funds, they buy more, to ""Average Down."" Or Dollar cost average (DCA) by buying a set amount on a regular cadence. They only “take profit” buy selling a small portion when price is really high.

Whales, are investors that come in with millions and billions of dollars. They often “test” the market buy either buying or dumping millions and billions in hopes to manipulate the market to their advantage. If you’re reading this, you’re probably not in this category, but you should know they exist and effect this marketplace.

Then there are “weak hands.” Do not pick this one. These people buy high and sell low. They only invest based on emotion, and nothing else. When things start going bad, they panic, and sell at a loss. Its much better to let your coin go to .000000001 cents, and just hold on to it in the hopes of a rally years later, then it is to ever sell at a loss. Never do this. Never.  
Take Luna for example. You probably lost your investment. Period. But, you never know.  
Look at Ripple. Look at Shib.  
Both were thought to be dead, but they live.

Each has its own risks and rewards.

Day trading can rack up dollars quick, but you can lose them just as quick. And there are tax implicates with trades. Some unknown, and constantly changing.

HODL, might take years, but if you do, the chance of your Return on Invest improves significantly in crypto.

Pick what works best for you but have a plan.

**What are things to look out for?**

**Do your own research**. There are now more then 4K types of crypto currencies. You can create your own in about 30 minutes with the right free tools.

The mortality rate of new coins is super high this year. Lots of people trying to do Pump and Dumps.

There is nothing in life that goes up for no reason, if it does, it’s a Ponzi scheme.

**What is the difference between storing on an exchange or in a wallet?**

A lot.

First, you must remember what the dream of crypto is really offering.

Its offering a way for us to break away from banks. Forever.

Centralized banks that can print money, is a problem. Blockchain solves this.

But not if the new bank ends up being Binace or Coinbase. In fact, keeping your coin in exchanges puts us all at risk of market manipulation by them.

When a certain 1 person or group owns too many nodes, they can make choices that would benefit them. The attack vector is called a 51% attack or sybil attack.

Today however, you need exchanges to on ramp and off ramp FIAT. FIAT money is government-issued currency that is not backed by a physical commodity, such as gold or silver.

But it will not be like that forever. Chains like ADA and DOT will be interoperable with legacy banks and will eventually cut out exchanges.

Personally, I despise BNB coin and binace. They already take high fees, and now they want the control and the rewards too. Coinbase isn’t much better. Again though, a necessary evil, for now.

But more important than the “dream” is that they can be hacked.

They are a website. Not a blockchain. They hold the keys to your wallet, and let you use them with a weak password and no mfa if you like. Its literally like storing your money in a bank. So know your bank. Good thing, like a bank, SOME, are federally insured up to a certain amount. But some are not, and people have lost millions and billions in the past this way.

Lastly, there is the notification of “passive income” and “interest.”

With POS systems, delegators are incentivized to “stake” their coin by earning interest.

With POW systems, like bitcoin, you’d have to stand up your own machine, configure it, and let it use your energy in your house. With chains like Cardano Ada, and ETH 2.0, you can now pull your coin off the exchange, put it in a wallet, delegate to a pool, and earn interest. All while maintaining full control of your coins.

**What are Smart Contracts? (This one will blow your mind if you are a developer)**

First let us start with what most people say.

“Smart contracts are self-executing contracts with the terms of the agreement between buyer and seller being directly written into lines of code.”

Which is true for sure. It helps build trust and removes the cumbersome third party “trusted agent” like a bank.

But what smart contracts really are is “ANY Code” that can be written to a blockchain and NEVER be changed, forever.

ANY CODE. You can write your own coins and put them into the block. It happens a lot.

Games, sure, put in the chain. Check out CryptoKitties.

In the future ALL business will be blockchain businesses. Every transaction, every process in the building and distribution, will be written to a magic book that can’t be messed with.. Ever..

**What are NFTs?**

NonFungible Tokens are metadata attached to an asset.

The metadata are things like who created it, and when. Along with the most important piece the link to the asset.

The asset is what most people think of when they talk about NFTs.  
Its a digital file. Like a jpg or a mov file.  
But its not stored in the blockchain like most assume.  
Instead they are stored, most often, in IPFS storage.  
IPFS is very cool, but its not blockchain, and thus not ""immutable.""

So what’s the big deal? I can upload a gif to the internet today.

The big deal is twofold.

First, you are not uploading anything to the “internet.” That whole thing we call the internet is flawed. Tracked, centralized, monitored, and gated.

What you are doing is creating an EARLY entry, in a book that will never change for the rest of time.

Let us sit and think about that for a second.

De Beers is going to have to get new slogan. “A ~~diamond~~ NFT is forever”

Right now, it is some awful GIF of a dogecoin. But it is not what it is. It is what it represents.

It is the next chapter in Art history. What is created will last longer than the Mona Lisa. Someday you will have blockchain archaeologist that comb though chains.

Plus, taking away the cool factor, they create a place that you can now prove you did it first.

Artist could upload lyrics as an NFT, and later sell them, without the fear their art might be stolen before a contract is in place. People could attach their house deed to a chain, and ever again dispute who owns the land after a conflict.

Besides gaming, NFTs are frequently used to sell a wide range of virtual collectibles, including NBA virtual trading cards, music, digital images, video clips and even virtual real estate in [Decentraland](https://decentraland.org/), a virtual world.

That of course is the rosier outlook on NFTs.

Unfortunately, in practice there are many gaps today.

The first I already mentioned. The asset is not stored in the blockchain.  
What that means is that the IPFS provider could ""unpin"" your asset, and if its not saved anywhere else, you'll end up with an NFT that has metadata that points to a url that has nothing there.

The second problem, is that there are thousands of blockchains. People can take your asset, because its publicly pined, and then go create an NFT on another blockchain, and then claim theirs is in fact the original. You'd have to check every chain that supports NFTs to ensure it was in fact the first first.

Or people have taken hard artwork, like paintings, and then minted and sold them as NFTs.

"What is the Ethereum merge, what are its economic implications and what are its main risks and misconceptions?","Before we understand what the merge really is we first have to understand the difference between PoW and PoS and how Ethereum will transfer from the former to the latter.  
I’m assuming that the vast majority of users here understand this so you can skip this part if you want.

# - PoW and PoS

As of the writing of this post, Ethereum currently runs on PoW (proof of work). The main goal of the merge is for Ethereum to move over to PoS (proof of stake).

The main difference between these two is that with PoW the network is secured by miners that have to purchase and run Ethereum mining hardware. This model has proven to be extremely inefficient since miners have to consume electricity in order to issue new blocks. This is exactly why Ethereum is notorious for being slow and expensive.

With the PoS model, on the other hand, the network is secured by validators who instead stake ETH in order to validate network activity. With this model, power consumption decreases dramatically.

With PoS, the network becomes more efficient, more secure, and can start benefiting from further upgrades most prominent of which is Sharding (which will be mentioned later on)  


# - What is the “merge”?

When people talk about “the merge” they’re actually talking about two-step of which the actual merge is one of them.

The first step is launching the Beacon Chain which was already done successfully in December of 2020.

The main goal behind this was to be able to test a chain running in parallel with the already existing PoW network without causing any disruption.

Another reason for this was to give time for stakers to stake enough ETH to secure the new network when implementing the actual merge

The second step is what we call the marge and it's what everyone is talking about right now.

The merge is simply the act of merging the consensus layer of the Beacon chain with the EVM state of the Ethereum PoW chain.  


# - What happens when the merge is fully implemented?

For starters, the power consumption needed to execute transactions and everything else on Ethereum dramatically decreases from what it was with PoW.  
In fact, it will decrease by almost 99.95%.

This is great for multiple reasons:

Firstly this makes Ethereum ESG compliant which is great for institutions overall especially ones that are regulatory driven. This will most definitely help boost mainstream adoption since many more global institutions will start exploring the Web3 space.

Second of all, a lot of the environmentally driven critics will finally shut down their arguments about NFTs, DeFi, and all Ethereum activity overall ruining the planet.

Third and finally, the merge will open up the groundwork for new updates included in the Ethereum roadmap that all of which combined will improve Ethereum overall, most important of which is Sharding.  


# - Misconceptions about the merge and how Sharding is related to that

The merge on its own will not make Ethereum gas fees lower. In fact, NOTHING will make gas on the Ethereum chain itself lower.

The Ethereum roadmap is not working on lowering gas fees on the chain, but instead is working on improving and integrating rollups and L2s in order for THEM to help with gas fees and traffic overall.

The L2 wars are more competitive than ever before but I think this is good news for Ethereum overall because it rewards innovation and new tech. But I’m personally biased towards Polygon as of now.

Speaking of which, I still have no idea how people still fall for this misconception that L2s and scaling solutions will be irrelevant with “ETH 2.0” (which isn’t even a thing anymore) even though Vitalik himself talked about it at the Polygon ZK summit back in 2021 where he discussed the importance of rollups on Ethereum

Ever since then, we’ve seen a flurry of development in the rollup scene and most notably the ZK-rollup with the recently mentioned Polygon leading the way with their open source zkEVM.

They already have 8 multipurpose Ethereum scaling solutions all of which will become even more efficient with Sharding introduced.  


# - What is the main risk behind the merge?

Any upgrade to any new technology comes with risks. This isn’t “FUD”. These are simply very improbable yet still realistic scenarios that may compromise the security of the PoS network.

Right now the biggest concern is a DOS scenario.

Since validators are the ones that are securing the chain, the network can technically be in danger of something called Network In Denial of Service (DOS) where if the attacker can know exactly which proposer is next in line they can try to DOS said proposer and strip them of their slot. The transactions that come with this slot can now be picked up by the attacker.

This is a very improbable scenario and already has solutions most popular of which is SSLE. Its basically complicated cryptography that prevents the attacker from knowing which proposer is next in line

I hope this post clears up some misconceptions, questions, and concerns overall. I’d be happy to answer any questions in the comments.",333.0,2022-08-11 13:57:27,0.94
Ethereum Upgrade Bullish for GameStop,"I would assume this is positive news for GameStop since their NFT marketplace is Ethereum based. Not only should the cost per transaction go down, the time to complete a transaction is also faster. For the tree huggers in the crowd, it’s also apparently much more energy efficient compared to the other major coin which should help Ethereum prices increase. All in all, sounds like great news for the GS NFT marketplace.

The Ethereum Merge Is NOT Priced IN! [Bullish... But WAIT],"I'm hearing  far too many people say that the merge is priced in. 

A few months ago, I was very vocal about too many VCs shilling their eth bags. It was extremely uncomfortable, and red flags were lining up with the technicals too.

Now I know many of you care only about the fundamentals, but there's a lot of alpha when you combine the fundamentals with the technicals (I started off as a purist fundamental trader too, as some of you *may* remember)

It allowed me to stay [cautious and warn against getting in on the Eth](https://twitter.com/ShawnDexta/status/1529745524525772800?t=t5eS3gH-OX9N1qXvQmLbMQ&s=19) Merge Trade months ago

Now, however, I think the opposite is happening.

Over the past week or so, I think a lot big money are finding themselves under allocated. As such, dips will be bid.

People are calling this a bear rally, and it may be so, but this could run harder than people think (2019 btc ""bear rally"" ran from 3k to 14k)

That being said, the time to build the eth trade was week to a few days ago. Atm, we are sitting at critical juncture. Building a position here requires a bit more management.

I break it down the bid areas (and caution areas) here in [this thread](https://twitter.com/ShawnDexta/status/1557646060012863488?t=V9Up6LUQXAjOBw5a2igXCQ&s=19) but Tldr:

1. We're at htf resistance, so the stress free trade is [waiting for a pull back](https://i.imgur.com/A5qrPr6.jpg) to 1550 to 1600 area (but we may not get it) 

2. Manage the trade on the LTF, but wait for price to accept ltf candles above the HTF box. [Ltf ](https://i.imgur.com/I6Ny2Me.jpg)

Anyway, I know many of you here don't want to ""trade"" this, but at the very least it should help those of you who temporarily derisked due to macro conditions.

Ethereum has been riding that hype wave for a while now going from near 800$ to 1800$ in a very short amount of time. And Merge is the biggest culprit.
Merge itself wont fix any scaling issues. That will still take several upgrades to achieve.

The 'Crypto Cutoff' Is Coming

By Eric Wade, editor,

Crypto Cashflow

A drawbridge is going up in the financial markets. As early as August 31, it could cutoff new crypto investors from the best that decentralized finance has to offer.

You see, when this cutoff happens, we expect many crypto prices to soar... And folkswho wait too long to invest in the best crypto projects will pay higher prices. In short,they'll miss out on some of the best gains in the space.

We're talking about the long-planned Ethereum (ETH) upgrade.

When this upgrade is released, Ethereum will undergo an unprecedented change...moving from a Proof-of-Work (""PoW"") consensus mechanism to a Proof-of-Stake(""PoS"") mechanism. It will become faster and cheaper to use... while maintaining thenetwork's security and decentralization.

It will also drastically improve how Ethereum handles inflation. Every time a newblock is created, the available supply of ETH will drop. This will turn Ethereum frominflationary to deflationary. That means every ETH will soon control a proportionally

larger and larger share of the network. And it will push up Ethereum prices and manycryptos built on the network.

Let me explain...

Most people are surprised when they learn that the first U.S. currency wasn't thedollar. But the current Mint Act system didn't create the dollar until 1792.

There were actually numerous currencies issued by the original 13 colonies. And in1775, the first U.S. Continental Congress issued the Continental currency. If you'renot familiar, it looked like this:

Part of me wishes we still had ""Mind Your Business"" printed on our currency. Sadly,Continentals were short-lived. By the 1790s, they had lost so much value that they

were redeemable for just 1% of their face value for the newly formed U.S. federalgovernment's Treasury bonds.

Inflation caused by runaway printing of legitimate bills – plus massive counterfeitingand poorly coordinated state monetary policies – eroded virtually all theContinentals' value. Anyone who held the currency risked financial ruin because ofrapid inflation.

It would be easy to look at this and say, ""Inflation also wiped out America's firstnational currency... so it's bad."" But economics has a funny way of never giving us astraight answer. After all, runaway inflation was how the colonies financed theRevolutionary War.

So we need to consider both sides of the coin when it comes to inflation.

In the case of the dollar... a little inflation helps fund growth, but too much inflationerodes wealth and purchasing power. That's what we're seeing today.

As you can see in the chart below, since the 1960s, U.S. dollar inflation has averaged3.8%. Today, inflation is 9.1%.

We obviously don't need to tell anyone how bad inflation has gotten. You see theproof everywhere you go – the gas station... the grocery store... you can't escape it.

Now, if you think the solution for inflation is deflation, it's not that straightforward.Sure, deflation means lower prices, but it often goes together with economiccontraction. It can even collapse overly indebted economies.

While blockchains only have some of the characteristics of a currency, they still havetheir own issue of inflation to deal with.

For example, bitcoin (BTC) is programmed to have a reasonable 1.8% current annualinflation. That means every year, the number of new bitcoin entering the ecosystemis limited to just 328,500.

But it wasn't always that way and it won't always be that way. When bitcoinlaunched, 2,628,000 new bitcoin entered the ecosystem each year. The numberdecreases around every four years and will drop again in 2024 to a mere 164,250new bitcoin per year. That works out to less than 1% inflation.

In the way that the high inflation of the U.S.'s early currency allowed a country togrow, bitcoin's early high inflation encouraged early users to spend. It allowed newusers to enter the ecosystem and accelerated the network's growth. Now thatinflation is lower, many people, companies, and even governments are holding theirbitcoin longer and longer.

Other blockchains have gone through a similar growth cycle... higher inflation at thebeginning and then reducing inflation as a token or coin matures.

But blockchains also must decide who the recipients of newly printed inflationarycoins will be. With bitcoin's PoW model, new coins are paid out to miners who runpowerful computers to validate transactions and secure the bitcoin blockchain asrewards. The computers run complicated algorithms to ensure that no coin has beenimproperly sent, ultimately helping to secure the network and make it less vulnerableto attacks.

Other coins follow different models. For example, PoS blockchains pay out rewardsto holders who validate transactions and secure the chain by ""staking"" some of theirown coins. Stakers essentially post their tokens as collateral to the network as apromise to act honestly and only put forward legitimate transactions. As an incentivefor validating legitimate transactions and keeping the network secure and honest,

stakers are rewarded with newly minted tokens. By doing this, stakers aren't justhelping the ecosystem, they're also participating in the token's inflationary upside.

Ethereum started out life as a PoW paying rewards to miners. But it will soonupgrade to PoS, paying rewards to stakers. With this unprecedented shift, Ethereumwill drop its issuance of new tokens by roughly 90%, from 5.5 million ETH to just600,000 new ETH minted each year.

On top of that, the Ethereum Improvement Proposal 1559 implemented last yearbegan a burn mechanism where some ETH is burnt and destroyed forever with eachblock. With the 90% drop in issuance and burn mechanism, ETH will transition frombeing inflationary to deflationary. The outstanding supply of ETH will slowlydecrease from the second the merge is completed until the network stops running.

You can think of this deflationary model like a stock buyback. When companies haveextra cash, they often buy their shares off the open market and retire them so thateach outstanding share holds a proportionally larger share of the company. The samewill happen with ETH. Every ETH will soon control a proportionally larger and largershare of the network. If someone stakes ETH, it will be like owning an ever-growingshare of an ever-shrinking pie.

That's why we believe ETH and several smaller tokens built on Ethereum willskyrocket in price. So now is the time to get in.

Good investing,

Eric Wade

Editor's note

**Frequently Asked Questions**

**Where's the best place to buy ETH?**

There are many centralized exchanges that support Ethereum. If you live in the US, the most popular exchanges are Coinbase, Gemeni and Kraken. Coinbase users can use Coinbase Pro for lower fees.

**When is Eth2 launching?**

Eth2 is a marketing term used to represent a number of updates to Ethereum. The Eth2 proof-of-stake chain first launched in December 2020. ""The Merge"", which is the event that will fully switch Ethereum's consensus to proof-of-stake, is estimated to be ready in early 2022, although there is no exact timeline. Other updates, such as data shards, will follow that update.

Visit [ethmerge.com](https://ethmerge.com/) to learn more about ""The Merge"".

**Do I need to do anything to update to Eth2? Will Eth2 create a new token?**

No, ETH holders *never* need to take any action to keep holding ETH. Ethereum users will be unaffected by the Eth2 upgrade. And the Eth2 updates will not create any new tokens.

**How can I stake my ETH?**

The best way to stake your ETH: by running your own validator.

* Running your own validator requires a modern computer and 32 ETH. Visit /r/ethstaker for more details

**Why are Ethereum transaction fees so high?**

Like most blockchains, Ethereum fees are determined by supply-and-demand. The large demand to use Ethereum has pushed transaction fees quite high (however, fees were just a few cents only 2 years ago). Fees are especially high during market volatility, and during NFT drops.

**What is being done to lower Ethereum transaction fees?**

Ethereum fees are reduced by using layer-2 rollups. Rollups are scaling solutions that allow for significantly cheaper transactions, while still maintaining Ethereum's security.

Additionally, Eth2's data shards will make rollups even cheaper.

While rollups are cutting-edge technology being actively developed, a number are already live on Ethereum mainnet. Visit [l2beat.com](https://l2beat.com/) to learn more about rollups.

**What's the best wallet for Ethereum?**

The most popular tool for using decentralized applications is Metamask. However, for security reasons, we recommend using a hardware wallet such as a Trezor or Ledger.

"Merging and Sharding won’t make scaling solutions obsolete. On the contrary, they’ll give scaling solutions more value.","This is a very common misconception in the Ethereum space and it’s actually been addressed on multiple occasions for a while not. Yet, the nearer the merge will be happening the more I’m starting to see people comment about “scaling solutions being obsolete when ETH2.0 rolls out”.

First of all, ETH2.0 is not a thing anymore. Ethereum on its own will not scale. ETH gas fees will always be high and we should swallow that pill already.

Ethereum is following a rollup-centric roadmap that will give more advantages and leverage to L2s and NOT the Ethereum blockchain itself.

This is exactly why we’ve been seeing so much development recently in the L2 space especially with zero-knowledge.

ZkSync has had their zkEVM testnet out for months now. Although I think its very frustrating that its closed source. It literally defeats the whole purpose of a zkEVM.

Polygon has their zkEVM in development still right now but its the only open source zkEVM that I know of so far.

And we’re only getting started. The growth in the L2 and scalability game is growing exponentially each passing day.

If we keep up this pace, Ethereum will become unrecognizable. The gas fee issues will become entirely irrelevant and Ethereum critics will shut up.

This will all happen thanks to scaling solutions, not Ethereum itself.

Vitalik himself even expressed his support for L2s and said something along the lines of that Ethereum’s future relies entirely on scaling solutions and more specifically rollups.",63.0,2022-08-06 21:33:42,0.85
Ethereum merge is going to be the game changer we have been waiting for.,"The merge is huge guys. At this point if you are not convinced of what an enormous event this will be for crypto and all of us who believe in the Ethereum project all I can say is be ready to watch this thing take off. It won't be over night although the media will praise this as one of the biggest technological and environmental upgrades seen to date. The fact these guys plan to merge at any given time without stopping the chain is truly amazing. The price may not be indicative of what will happen right away but as Ethereum after merge continues its road map and executes it to perfection you will see more and more people and institutions get on board. There is simply too much money to be made and too many goodies to play with like DEFI, NFT's or ENS domains plus now we are at almost all of us on a layer 2.(if you aren’t here yet WTF are you waiting for?) They keep coming and its not stopping. Once all exchanges participate and on board clients to L2's the game will have changed forever.

In my opinion Ethereum is going to lead the pack of crypto moving forward. I won't talk about flippening or stuff like that because simply who cares. The tech and decentralization speaks for itself. The world's computer is here to stay and not going anywhere. What I am most excited about is that Ethereum is going to take center stage soon and will be finally be acknowledged as a wonderful decentralized technology that welcomes all humans and all institutions to join, build and play. Its the way it should be. All inclusive with no means to discriminate or shun those who don't agree with it. You know who you are!

The Risks of Interacting with Prospective PoW Forks of Ethereum,"**Post-Merge edit: The two PoW fork chains you may have heard about have both set new Chain IDs, so this warning post is no longer relevant.**

You may have heard that there might be a PoW fork of Ethereum created during the Merge. This post exists as a warning of how risky interacting with prospective forks like this can be.

**What's the issue?**

After the Merge, Ethereum will be PoS. However, some miners might continue to mine on a vestigial PoW fork of Ethereum. Unless the miners are able to coordinate **before the Merge** to create and all agree to run their own new PoW-only release of the Geth client, with a new chain ID, it will be possible to ""replay"" transactions made on one side of the fork, onto the other one. Anyone can do this to your transactions, at zero cost to themselves. 

This means if you try to sell your Eth or other assets on the PoW fork, *you might lose your real Eth or other assets too.*

**How can I keep my real Eth 100% safe?**

Don't touch the PoW fork.

**Okay, but I want to anyway. How can I keep my real Eth 95% safe?**

You need to try and ensure that your transactions on the PoW fork cannot be replayed with your real assets on the PoS fork. To do this, you want to make it be the case that **any replayed transactions will fail for some reason.** Some possible approaches:

1. **Make it fail because of invalid nonces.** ""Use up"" some nonces on the PoS fork, before submitting a PoW fork transaction. Do at least as many transactions on the real chain as you plan to do on the PoW fork, so that those nonces are no longer valid. The PoW transactions, once you make them, will use those same old nonces, and the transaction will fail if an attacker tries to replay it on PoS. *Make sure to do this AFTER the Merge, otherwise those nonces will be used up on PoW and PoS both, and this approach won't help.*
2. **Make it fail because of invalid preconditions.** Move your Eth or other assets to a different wallet on the PoS fork. Then you can safely dump your PoW fork Eth or whatever. If that transaction is attempted to be replayed on the PoS fork, it will fail because the preconditions (i.e. your Eth is still there) will fail. Same as above - you have to do this *after* the Merge.
3. **Make it fail because of too-low gas.** Send your transactions with a very low basefee on the PoW fork. Post-Merge, the basefee on the PoW fork is extremely likely to take a hard nosedive, likely to small fractions of a gwei (this happened on Polygon when they first implemented 1559). This is due to a lack of demand compared to the real Ethereum chain. It means you will be able to get transactions through on the PoW chain for insanely cheaply, and more importantly, that there's very little chance of those transactions getting replayed on the PoS fork. The attempted replay won't fail, but it will be stuck forever because it will never have enough gas to meet basefee on the real PoS fork.

**So what about that 5%? What can go wrong?**

Imagine an attacker decides to replay all transactions that people are doing on the PoS fork, onto the PoW fork (this is the reverse of the replays I've been warning about above). So all your legitimate business conducted on the normal chain would be mirrored onto the PoW fork. This would only work for so long, because the state on the real fork will eventually diverge from that on the PoW fork, but it would definitely work for weeks or months post-Merge in most cases. Importantly, if someone does this, *it would defeat 1. and 2. above*. 

If you attempted to up your nonces on PoS first, but the attacker just mirrored those transactions onto PoW, then when you went to submit your PoW transaction, the nonce would be fresh on both forks, and you'd be risking your real Eth. 

Similarly, if you moved your assets before touching PoW, the attacker might've copied those moves first. In this case, you would just find your Eth already gone from the address you had been planning to dump it from. You might be tempted to dump it from the address it got moved to, but that's just back to the original risk.

For 3., the risk, of course, is gas actually getting that low on the real PoS fork for whatever reason. Unlikely, but not impossible.

**Can I eliminate that 5% and do this completely safely?**

Perhaps. If you carefully watch basefee prices on the PoW fork, and they are significantly lower than basefee on PoS (like, a factor of 5-10x lower), you may be able to submit your ""dump Eth"" transaction on the PoW fork with that low basefee, and be temporarily safe from replays because gas is too high on the real chain. Then, while protected by gas from PoW->PoS replays, you can submit a PoS transaction to move your Eth to a different account. This prevents gas in future from becoming low enough to replay your PoW transaction, because your Eth will already be moved elsewhere on PoS, and also because that nonce will have been used up. And this transaction cannot be replayed on PoW because the nonce is already used up there, too. This approach may be 100% safe, if executed perfectly.

**Is all this trouble worth it for a few tens or hundreds of dollars worth of fake Eth?**

No.",136.0,2022-08-05 01:33:59,0.97
Technical questions around how validation will work under Danksharding," Hi all,  


I have some technical questions about danksharding and validation committees.

From this post on two-slot proposer-builder separation: [https://ethresear.ch/t/two-slot-proposer-builder-separation/10980](https://ethresear.ch/t/two-slot-proposer-builder-separation/10980), danksharding is meant to be a two-slot process, meaning (if I've understood it correctly) it will take two 8-second slots for the whole build-propose-verify-append process to be completed.

https://preview.redd.it/ilra7u7ajpf91.png?width=1162&format=png&auto=webp&s=58908e091f7da720e50bea2363c220e50feac1a4

With PBS, after the intermediate block deadline, we see the remaining 'N-1 committees' attest to the block body. My first questions:  
1. Is the committee size here still the same as that intended immediately post-Merge, i.e. 128 validators, or something else?  
2. What is N here? The whole validator set available divided by 128?  
3. These N-1 committees attest to the block body tying up to the block header. But do they also verify for data availability and transaction validity (i.e. check for validity proofs in the case of ZKRs, or raise fraud proofs in the case of ORs)?  


My next questions relate to this report: [https://members.delphidigital.io/reports/the-hitchhikers-guide-to-ethereum](https://members.delphidigital.io/reports/the-hitchhikers-guide-to-ethereum), and specifically, this image from it:

(Image taken from section titled 'Danksharding – Honest Majority Validation'.)

My additional questions from the image:  
4. 1/32 of the whole validator set is assigned to attest to the data availability of the block in each slot, as there are 32 slots in an epoch. But with PBS, the block cycle now should take two slots! So is this incorrect? Or should it be something like 1/16 attesting every two slots?  
5. Is '1/32 of the validator set' meant to be the same as the 'N-1 committees', and these data availability checks happens at the same time as that process? Or is this data availability verification a separate process with different groups of validators that happens after the 'N-1 committee' attestation?  
6. Does the '1/32 of the validator set' also attest to the transaction validity of each block?   
7. Later in the same report it's stated that it's intended for the other full nodes (i.e. those not in the validation set) to do their own private data availability sampling. If so, will they \*\*also\*\* be doing their own transaction validity verifications? This may be trivial for validity proofs, but I expect it may be quite onerous for fraud proofs. How would this work in practice?",25.0,2022-08-04 14:34:18,0.94
BNB Chain Technology Update for July 2022,"&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/c6u47bv17nf91.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&s=5a44d83738149935a969d10b6ff5d48116e4ff68

 

*July was an exciting month for BNB Chain as we made further progress with the release of BSC v1.1.12, testing our BNB ZkRollup, working on our BNB Side Chain and the exciting BNB Beacon Chain Godel upgrade on Testnet.*

## Major Tech Updates for July

**1. BSC Release v1.1.12 -** A performance release that greatly slows down the storage growth and improves the syncing efficiency.

**2. BNB ZkRolllup is under testing -** A lot of refactoring and bug fixes for the initial release.

**3.** **BNB Side Chain -** POC of native asset bridge for BNB Side Chain.

**4. BNB Beacon Chain Godel Upgrade on Testnet -** Godel Upgrade will give Beacon Chain more computing power for future computing and governance focus by decommissioning the Dex.

### 1. BSC Release v1.1.12

Release v1.1.12 is a performance release. The following three features are introduced in this release.

**1.1 Fast Node**

Fast Node is a new syncing protocol to lower the hardware requirement and improve the syncing efficiency. This release introduces two types of nodes to make full use of different storage, one is called **Fast Node**, and the other is called **Verify Node**. The **Fast Node** will do block processing with a flattened key-value DB, it will do all verification against blocks except the state root. The **Verify Node** receives diffhash from the fast node and then responds to MPT root to assist with the state root verification. If you want to learn more about this feature, please refer to the [docs](https://docs.bnbchain.org/docs/BSC-separate-node/).

It turns out that the fast node can slow down the storage growth by 60%\~90% according to different settings and increase the syncing efficiency by about 30%. We encourage node operators who do not care about 100% state consistency to enable fast nodes by appending ***--tries-verify-mode none*** to the node command.

**1.2 Pruning AncientDB at Runtime**

A new flag is introduced to prune ancient undesired block data at runtime, it will discard **block**, **receipt**, **header** in the ancient DB to save space.

**1.3 Merge Go-Ethereum V1.10.15**

We upgrade the code base of Go-Ethereum from v1.10.3 to v1.10.15. A lot of new features, bug fixes, library upgrades, as well as some breaking changes from Go-Ethereum are merged to BSC v1.1.12.  


[To know more about BSC V1.1.12, please read the release note.](https://github.com/bnb-chain/bsc/releases/tag/v1.1.12)

### 2. BNB ZkRolllup Phase1

BNB ZkRolllup is a trustless and scaling solution for BSC. BNB ZkRolllup is built on ZK-Rollup architecture. We have done a lot of testing and refactoring in the past month to approach a stable release. It is going to open source in August.

### 3. BNB Side Chain

The key parts of each BNB Side Chain are the native token circulation model and the cross-chain bridge for native assets. Native assets of the side chain are located in the side chain application and managed by the sidechain directly. BNB Side Chain is designed to provide cross-chain functionality for the native assets.

The developers from Ankr team finished the POC of the native bridge according to the [BEP100](https://github.com/bnb-chain/BEPs/pull/132/files).

[To know more about the implementation details, please refer to the repo.](https://github.com/bnb-chain/bas-relay-hub)

**4. BNB Beacon Chain Godel Upgrade on Testnet**

BNB Beacon Chain’s primary focus, its native decentralized application (""dApp"") BNB DEX, has demonstrated its low-latency matching with large capacity headroom. With the development of BNB Smart Chain and AMM-based decentralized exchanges running well on it, BNB DEX has less usage and liquidity. After the Godel upgrade, the DEX module will be disabled, which will give Beacon Chain more computing power for future computing and governance focuses.

What's Your Formula to Achieve Financial Freedom?,"One can say that money does not bring happiness, but the absence of money does bring unhappiness. Money gives you the freedom to open a business or work on something you are really passionate about, even if it is free.

So, if your savings rate is 50%, this means that you save $500 out of every $1,000. For every month you work, you get another month for free.

* 5 years worked allow me to live for 10 years (5 of them without working).
* 10 years of work allow me to live for 20 years (10 of them without working).

Obviously, 50% of the salary is a lot of money, and in 90% of the cases in the world, it is unfeasible, but continue to the end, I have the solution.

Start doing your accounts as if you were not going to have a pension.

Now comes one of the main problems in our society today, and in the coming years, inflation. If you save $100 and there is a 10% inflation, in 7 years, your purchasing power will be half.

So for that better not to save and spend all the money, right? This is a more personal question. It may be that your money will lose purchasing power, but if you prefer to be exposed to all of the above?

This is one of the reasons we like to be exposed to a deflationary currency like Bitcoin or like Ethereum once the Merge occurs. These are currencies with extreme volatility in the short term but incredible returns in the long term. To sweeten the pill, there are crypto platforms to earn a passive income while you hold your crypto, e.g [Midas.Investments](https://Midas.Investments) with 9.4% APY on BTC and 10.6% APY on ETH.

If you do not want to buy Bitcoins and what you want is to preserve your purchasing power and gain freedom, your solution is to invest. If you save 50% of your salary and get an annual return of 5% above inflation, in theory, you could retire in 16.6 years.

If you start this plan at 22, you can retire at 39.

Obviously, your savings rate is lower, but the returns can be higher. Let’s say the savings rate is 20% and your return is 10%, in which case you could retire in 25.2 years.

The main conclusion is that the savings rate has more impact than the return.",23.0,2022-08-02 11:05:10,0.74
"Happy Birthday, Ethereum!","Today the second biggest cryptocurrency - Ethereum - celebrates its 7th birthday. What did those years look like?

Price-wise, Ethereum grew A LOT. From its all-time-low in 2015 of $0.432979 to its all-time-high of $4878 in 2021.

Technology-wise, Ethereum has pioneered the concept of a blockchain smart contract platform and built a strong foundation for many new projects.

Ethereum’s DeFi scene is the biggest one out there, with successful DApps bringing more awareness to the platform over the years. And let’s not forget artists that make millions of dollars by bringing their work to the blockchain via NFTs.

Fun fact, the co-founder of Ethereum, Vitalik Buterin, says that the project is now only 40% complete.

At the Ethereum Community Conference in Paris, he compared the network to its longtime rival, stating that “the difference between Bitcoin and Ethereum is that Bitcoiners consider Bitcoin to be 80% complete, but Ethereans consider Ethereum to be 40% complete.” And that Ethereum will reach 55% after a long-awaited merge, where it will shift from proof of work to proof of stake.

We wish them a successful merge and can’t wait to see the full potential of ETH!

If you had the chance to ask the core developers of Ethereum a question what would you ask them?,I’m trying to get a feeling for how the community feels the merge is going as well as educate myself on the biggest concerns with Ethereum at this time. Would love to see some of the top questions the community has and what they would ask EF if given the chance.,76.0,2022-07-30 05:11:50,0.95
I still see “ETH 2.0” being thrown around. It is just not a thing anymore. The Foundation has changed up the nomenclature and marketing surrounding the Ethereum roadmap.,"I’m surprised as to how many people are still confused about this. So here are some footnotes.Ethereum’s roadmap has a lot of upgrades but the most significant two will be merging and Sharding.

# 

# - Oh no! What will happen to my staked ETH?

Don’t worry about that. When the merge with beacon chain happens (Ethereum going from PoW to PoS which was originally marketed as ETH2.0) the number one priority will be enabling withdrawals. The merge happen anytime soon now, with withdrawals scheduled for \~6 months after the merge is fully complete

# 

# - Gas Concerns

Gas on Ethereum itself is never going to be cheap.  It is a reality that we have to live with.  In fact, lately gas has been about as cheap as it ever will be moving forward.

# - The Merge and Gas

It is a misconception that the merge will lower gas fees. It will not. I mean, block validation times will get reduced by around a second or so, but that will only have very minimal and irrelevant effects on gas prices.

# 

# - Sharding and Gas

Sharding, which was originally designed to reduce gas across the board, has been changed. The Ethereum roadmap is now fully layer-2 (more precisely rollup) centric, and with that danksharding will be the way forward.

Again, Ethereum itself won’t be affected by this. What Sharding will do however is drastically help L2s lower their already low gas fees even further.But that’s alright because Ethereum is fully adopting L2s and scaling solutions as part of the blockchain.

As a reaction to that, we’re starting to see a lot of funds and developments being applied by Ethereum scaling solutions. already seeing some scaling solutions like Polygon alone is already sitting on a massive arsenal of scaling solutions with 8 of them ready to scale Ethereum and an open source zkEVM on the way that will help Solidity developers benefit from Ethereum’s security and Polygon’s efficiency.

Sharding will most likely arrive and be fully implemented in 2023 - 2024 so hang in there. (This is considering that everything goes as planned and no delays happen, which is usually not the case).

&#x200B;

There will also be further network optimization planned down the line. All of them are designed for the goal of further reducing gas costs and making Ethereum a much more efficient network overall.",259.0,2022-07-29 16:12:23,0.86
"The Merge is just around the corner, how's everyone feeling?","Just to preface before the haters fly in, I own Ethereum and support the project, I am discussing the merge and going over consensus algos voicing my thoughts and opinions.

With the merge coming up there's been a ton of discussion about PoS, how will it work, what are the benefits, why did they swap, etc. PoS is a consensus system implemented to continue the scalability of Etherreum (you can find a million sources to explain it), I understand why the choice was made and respect it, but for the sake of discussion I wanted to talk about other consensus algos.

Proof of Work (PoW) is what Ethereum is currently using, the same as BTC. You mine the token, receive it, and do whatever you want. Wanna earn more tokens, spend more money on mining equipment to mine more tokens, pretty straight forward. The benefits are large holders would need to invest millions upon millions in equipment to hold a large market share. Not only this, PoW also has the possibility of mining invalid blocks which lead to a loss.

To keep it simple, PoS eliminates one of the biggest downsides to PoW which is the equipment expense. Obtain the token and stake it to receive more and support the network. The issue however, is that large holders may simply stake their Ethereum for as long as they want, controlling a large market share and reducing the rewards for everyone involved. The more people stake, the worse the rewards.

Aside from PoW and PoS, there's also other consensus algorithms like Analog's Proof-Of-Time (PoT) concept which uses a ranking score and time-based technology to validate their nodes. Potentially preventing hacks more efficiently than other mechanisms. Solanas Proof-Of-History (PoH) consensus that utilizes time stamps to validate events and transactions, and then hashing them to make inputs difficult to predict, etc.

The issues with other options of course are things like security of the network itself, the technology may be flawed, and of course, the lack of decentralization.

Regardless, I wanted to know what everyone thinks. Is PoS the best option for the merge? If so, then why? Could there have been another route Ethereum took to evolve? Let me know your opinions",318.0,2022-07-28 01:48:07,0.87
Buying Eth Classic is dumb as Dogeshit.,"Eth classic is pumping today, despite being a useless chain, solely because crypto miner Antpool announced a $10 million investment in Eth classic. You must ask yourself why Antpool would announce such an investment (a relatively trivial one at that - $10 million is fairly small compared to what most legitimate chains invest in development. Example, Polygon announced a $100 million developer fund a couple months ago on top of millions invested over the last year. Many more examples of other chains if you have been paying attention). 

The reason is likely because Antpool is one of the biggest crypto miners, the 3rd largest Bitcoin mining pool and 14th largest Ethereum mining pool. As such, they have the most to lose when proof of work projects die out, which most inevitably will absent perhaps Bitcoin. They know Eth’s merge to proof of stake this year will further kill the utility of an already useless chain like Eth Classic. Without users, mining pools like Antpool that mine dead chains like Eth classic become less profitable. So they make an announcement of a trivial investment fund to get you to buy it so they can sell their mined Eth classic at a bit higher price. Buy away if you choose, but buyer beware, because there’s only one true, functional, and highly developed Ethereum and it doesn’t have the word classic in its name.",362.0,2022-07-27 23:42:59,0.77

Ethereum (ETH) | Are we going to break 2K this summer?,"Over the past week, ETH has risen over 33% and surpassed the $1600 mark, breaking several resistance zones along the way. As ETH continues to gain strength, the $2k resistance is in its sights. But will the bullish momentum carry ETH to this key level?

* *Though the market appears to be bottoming and sentiment reversing, fundamentals have not yet picked up. Eth network usage remains low, and fees have only burned \~17% of emissions over the past week. This value is consistent with the lows we have seen throughout the bear market. Ethereum does, however, appear to be leading the market recovery as the merge is the leading narrative in crypto right now. With the tentative date of September 19 less than two months away, we could see this narrative continue to drive market recovery through the end of the summer.* 

ETH looks bullish on the 4H and Weekly, but set for consolidation on the daily. ETH looks incredibly strong in the long term, as bullish TA and a market-leading narrative set the stage for a strong market recovery. We could, however, see a pullback in the medium term – to confirm support zones and shake out overconfident longs.

Why max supply is often a lie,"**TL;DR**: You should never blindly trust the maximum supply for a token that uses a rewards pool for miners/validators that will eventually run out. There is a high chance their ""fixed"" maximum supply will need to be adjusted in the future. Most of these networks are being fed subsides like heroin, and they expect the miners/validators to survive on negligible transaction fees alone once the subsidy pool abruptly runs out.

Some of them can survive post-subsidy, but we won't find out until a bear cycle after their subsidies run out.

-------------------

##The issue with networks that have a maximum token supply and pre-allocated rewards pool

I've been spending a lot of time on Messari and TokenTerminal studying tokenomics for dozens of cryptocurrencies. One pattern that has come up over and over again are networks that have:

1. A maximum token supply coupled with
1. A rewards pool that will eventually run out
1. With no realistic plans to wean off the subsides

**This is a huge red flag because when the rewards pool runs out, they will need to find a new source of revenue to pay miners/validators. The transaction fees are often 100x smaller than what's needed to sustain the network. There's a huge chance the supposedly-fixed maximum supply will not hold.**

Most of these platforms are trying to grow their networks as fast as possible by attracting users with their low transaction fees, which are only enabled through rewards subsidies. Many of their documentations and roadmaps suggest that transaction fees will cover the revenue. However, transactions on low-fee networks are usually 20-200x smaller than what's needed to economically sustain the network. These plans work if the networks can grow their total transaction fees by 20-200x from their current peak, and **remain higher than that during bear markets**. That's extremely difficult and often impossible in many cases. Directly increasing fee schedules drives away activity, decreasing overall TPS and fee generation. And many of these networks already get congested if you increase throughput by even 20x, let alone 100x.

In addition, transaction fees are highly-volatile and do not provide a constant revenue stream for miners and validators. Without subsidies, rewards during bear cycles will collapse, and miners/validators/participants will leave. This causes rewards and security to collapse even more, leading to a feedback loop of declining activity. Thus networks also need constant issuance to keep the network stable. This requires removing the fixed max supply.

Nearly all supply-inflation discussion threads are dominated by people who just blindly assume token inflation will suddenly end because the documentation says so. That's a naive assumption. Some blockchains will succeed in keeping their max supply; others won't. You can't know for sure until years after the subsidies run out.

---------

##Let's look at some case studies of token supply models

**We don't know whether these networks can succeed without changing their tokenomics until years after their subsidy runs out. They have to survive for at least 1 bear cycle post-subsidy. Some of them will succeed and others won't. All I'm saying is that you shouldn't blindly trust the max supply.**

In the examples below, I define ""**issuance**"" as an increase in **circulating/liquid supply**, not by token minting. Minting does not affect a token's supply economics until the tokens are actually put into circulation. Note that Messari.io is not 100% accurate due to networks deviating from their documented plans, but it's usually close enough to make fair estimates of supply running out within a year.

**Ethereum, Solana, Dogecoin - Sustainable models**

* **Tokens that have no max supply and continuous issuance have a sustainable token supply model.**
* Ethereum's token burn from its high transaction fees is expected to be enough to offset its token issuance after the merge, so even with no max supply, it's expected to have nearly zero net issuance. Validators will receive a steady flow of revenue even when transactions dwindle. This will work even during bear markets. **I predict many networks will attempt to switch to this tokenomics model.**

**Polygon - Model likely not sustainable past 2024**

- According to [Messari.io](https://messari.io/asset/polygon/profile/supply-schedule), MATIC had 67% inflation in 2022, 31% in 2021, 13% in 2022.
- MATIC has a 1.2B token pool reserved for validator rewards that's [expected to run out 5 years after launch](https://docs.polygon.technology/docs/maintain/validator/rewards/). This issue has been brought up many times across various forums, and the Polygon Foundation has ignored it. **It's not sustainable past 2024** unless the Foundation pays from their own funds.
- My hunch is that they don't want to admit 10B isn't going to hold as the max supply. **MATIC transaction fees need to grow ~30x to cover validator rewards.**
- Remember when Sunflower Farm congested the network in Jan 2022 and fees shot up 50x? Now imagine another 30x increase in fees on top of that during congestion.
- Polygon is already fairly centralized with its 100-validator limit. It can't easily lower rewards and risk reducing its centralization even further.

**Avalanche - Model likely not sustainable past 2030**

* The Avalanche networks are sustained by high inflation, which is how they keep transaction fees low. Validators are paid by a pre-allocated staking rewards pool, and those staking rewards account for a HUGE amount of the annual inflation.
* The [vesting schedule](https://messari.io/asset/avalanche/profile/launch-and-initial-token-distribution) leads to a 30% increase in supply in 2022, followed by a 22% increase in 2023.
* **Transaction fees are burned, but the transactions fees are so low that the [burnt amount is unnoticeable](https://burnedavax.com/).** Burns are in the tens of millions of dollars ([TokenTerminal shows $10M in annual fee revenue](https://tokenterminal.com/terminal/projects/avalanche)) while issuance is 100x greater in the billions of dollars. **Fees would need to be 100x higher to offset token issuance.**
* AVAX issues [45M tokens per year starting at 2025](https://messari.io/asset/avalanche/profile/supply-schedule) until it reaches its 720M max supply around Apr 2030. Unless fees grow 100x higher by 2030, AVAX's supply distribution model is going to break in 2030.

**Algorand - Model likely not sustainable past 2030**

* Algorand has very high inflation. This has been discussed [time](https://np.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/vu26qy/the_great_algo_mass_inflation_event_of_2021_the/) and [time](https://forum.algorand.org/t/serious-lack-of-transparency-and-engagement-of-algorand-foundation/2385/10) again while everyone assumes the 10B maximum supply is immutable LAW. The rewards are pre-minted, but there is vesting schedule for those rewards that increases the circulating supply by 49% in 2021, 20% in 2022, 23% in 2023, before tapering off at 9.4% in 2024 and beyond.
* There are multiple rewards pools for relay nodes, validators (prior to 2022), and governance. These pools eventually run out by 2030. Plans for long-term economic sustainability [were redesigned to last until 2030](https://algorand.foundation/governance/algo-dynamics). There is no plan for sustainable relay node rewards or governance rewards past then. Validation nodes, which have much lower hardware requirements, are already running on altruism. What's really scary is that nearly all of token issuance is going to relay nodes and will abruptly run out in 2030 at which point they no longer have any economic incentive to stay with Algorand. Participation rewards will also run out then. The only pool left will be the tiny fee sink.
* Transactions fees currently do not pay validators and nodes. They go into a fee sink, but it's currently very tiny and only produces [$140k of annual revenue](https://tokenterminal.com/terminal/projects/algorand). This is about **100-200x smaller than annual issuance**. Thus they are not anywhere close to being able to offset token issuance.
* Another way of looking at this is that there needs to be [3000 TPS of real activity by 2030](https://np.reddit.com/r/AlgorandOfficial/comments/vvxb9e/what_tps_does_algorand_need_to_be_sustainable_by/), 200x higher than its current 15 TPS average.

**Fantom - Model likely not sustainable past 2024**

- Fantom's low transaction fees are subsidized. The total annualized revenue from transaction fees is about [$2.7m](https://tokenterminal.com/terminal/projects/fantom), which is 30x smaller than the amount currently being paid for block rewards.
- Fantom's supply is expected in inflate by 9% in 2022 and 8% in 2023. Supply inflation is currently scheduled to [end in 2024](https://messari.io/asset/fantom/profile/supply-schedule), though it might last until 2025 with high token burns. This inflation might need to be extended indefinitely to pay for validators once the 1.0B token rewards pool runs out. The max supply will likely not hold.
- Until it upgrades to FVM, it's already at its limit and cannot grow its TPS, but it can afford to increase fees by 10x and still be very cheap.
- It has very few validators, so it can't afford to reduce rewards and risk losing more.

**Bitcoin**

- I'm not going to discuss Bitcoin because the game theory behind post-subsidy miner incentives is extremely complex.
- Instead, see these articles:  [here](https://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/questions/3111/will-bitcoin-suffer-from-a-mining-tragedy-of-the-commons-when-mining-fees-drop-t), [here](https://cryptofundamental.com/21-done-will-bitcoin-survive-the-tragedy-of-the-commons-271a6cd21b04), [here](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Tragedy_of_the_Commons), and [here](https://unchainedpodcast.com/can-bitcoin-be-secured-only-by-transaction-fees-two-researchers-sound-off/)
- We will likely have to wait until 2050 to 2070 to get a better idea.

---------

##There is a general fix for this problem

**Solution**: Remove the fixed max supply and replace it with a system of steady issuance and variable token burns to keep **total supply** near the original max supply. The hard part is increasing transaction fees enough to offset issuance.

1. Introduce steady new issuance (no more fixed max supply) to reduce reward volatility
2. Increase total transaction fees (and token burns) to offset issuance. You can increase this through a mix of higher fees and higher activity (real TPS).
3. Reduce rewards and hope that not too many miners/validators quit.

This is similar to what Ethereum does, but it's hard to copy. Ethereum is only able to achieve this with very high fees, very high sustained demand, and by reducing rewards by 80% when switching from PoW to PoS.

Step 1 to remove the fixed max supply is necessary to keep the network stable. Steps 2 and 3 by themselves are not enough because rewards will be volatile. Rewards during bear cycles will collapse, and miners/validators/participants will leave. This causes rewards and security to collapse even more, leading to a feedback loop of declining activity.

**Difficulty of achieving 100x growth in fees**: One might think it's easy to achieve 100x growth in total transaction fees by increasing the gas cost by 10x and real TPS activity by 10x. The problem with this assumption is that many low-fee networks are popular due to their low fees. **Increasing fees by 10x would scare customers away and reduce overall revenue.** Back when Avalanche's C-Chain and Polygon PoS were congested, their smart contract fees were above $1 USD. People are going to keep away from those networks if their fees are increased to over $10. **The safer method is to increase real TPS, but many of these networks would get congested at 20-100x their current real TPS.**

Lastly, many members of these crypto communities are very proud of their network's fixed maximum supply and have invested under the assumption that they will not change. **A change to maximum supply will always be extremely controversial.** If it fails to hold, there could be a collapse of faith in that token.",104.0,2022-07-24 16:04:44,0.81
"The merge, the surge, the verge, the purge and the splurge… I think ETH is bound to surpass BTC","
I believe that what any crypto project needs to become a unicorn are a great visionary, a concrete plan, a beautiful and achievable roadmap and a great team that can pull it all together. And you know what? I think Ethereum has all of these attributes, and in just a matter of time, ETH should surpass BTC in price value.
That could sound preposterous though, but just watch it. Remember let’s also not forget that Ethereum launched about six years after Bitcoin did. I feel the time span between both projects is partly responsible for the price difference between both tokens. 

Ethereum however seems to have everything in lace right now to go on turbo speed; and I guess lots of newer projects on the Ethereum network like decentralized  communication platform Toklok, and projects across other chains have a whole lot to learn from Ethereum’s business style.

With all of the events highlighted to take place after the Merge, IMO Ethereum has the tendency to surpass BTC tops five years from this time.",60.0,2022-07-24 14:09:30,0.8
"Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin said on Thursday that Ethereum will be about 55% complete after the “merge,” when the network moves from proof-of-work (PoW) to a proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus system.","Proof of stake is much more secure than proof of work, but it does have its tradeoffs,” like weak subjectivity, Buterin said at the Ethereum Community Conference (EthCC) in Paris, Fortune reported.
Buterin said the difference between Bitcoin and Ethereum is that Bitcoin is considered to be 80% complete in terms of development.
Ethereum, on the other hand, is considered to be only about 40% complete at the moment, which will increase post-merge.  
Last week, Ethereum developers announced that the merge will tentatively take place during the week of Sept. 19.",25.0,2022-07-22 07:52:27,0.82
4844 and Done - my argument for canceling danksharding," 

At EthCC yesterday, Vitalik joked “[should we cancel sharding?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGjFTzRTH3Q)”

There were no takers.

I raise my hand virtually and make the case for why Ethereum should cancel danksharding.

The danksharding dream is to enable rollups to achieve global scale while being fully secured by Ethereum. We can do it, yes, but no one asked - should we?

Ethereum has [higher standards for data sharding](https://members.delphidigital.io/reports/the-hitchhikers-guide-to-ethereum), which requires a significantly more complex solution of combining KZG commitments with PBS & crList in a novel P2P layer than alternative data layers like DataLayr, Celestia, zkPorter or Polygon Avail. This will a) take much longer and b) adds significant complexity to a protocol we have been simplifying (indeed, danksharding is the latest simplification, but what if we go one further?).

EIP-4844, aka protodanksharding, is a much simpler implementation that’s making serious progress. Although not officially announced for Shanghai just yet, it’s being targeted for the upgrade after The Merge.

Assuming the minimum gas price is 7 wei, ala EIP-1559, EIP-4844 resets gas fees paid to Ethereum for [one transaction to $0.0000000000003](https://twitter.com/apolynya/status/1504723682224066561) (and that’s with ETH price at $3,000). Note: because execution is a significantly more scarce resource than data, the actual fee you’d pay at the rollup will be more like $0.001 or something, and even higher if congested with high-value transactions (we have seen Arbitrum One fees for an AMM swap extend to as high as $4 recently. Sure, Nitro will increase capacity by 10x, but even that’ll get saturated eventually, and 100x sooner than protodanksharding, more in the next paragraph.) Once again, your daily reminder that data is a significantly more abundant resource than execution and will accrue a small fraction of the value. Side-note: I’d also argue that protodanksharding actually ends up with greater aggregate fees than danksharding, due to the accidental supply control, so those who only care about pumping your ETH bags need not be concerned. But even this will be very negligible compared to the value accrued to ETH as a settlement layer and as money across rollups, sidechains and alt-L1s alike.

With advanced data compression techniques being gradually implemented on rollups, we’d need to roughly 1,000x activity on rollups, or 500x activity on Ethereum mainnet, or 100x the entire blockchain industry today, to saturate protodanksharding. There’s tremendous room for growth without needing danksharding. (Addendum: Syscoin is building a [protodanksharding-like solution](https://syscoin.org/news/roadmap-development-updates-mid-2022) and estimate a similar magnitude of data being “good enough”.)

Now, with such negligible fees, we could see a hundred rollups blossom, and eventually it’ll be saturated with tons of low value spammy transactions. But do we really need the high security of Ethereum for these?

I think it’s quite possible that protodanksharding/4844 provides enough bandwidth to secure all high-value transactions that really need full Ethereum security.

For the low-value transactions, we have new solutions blossoming with honest-minority security assumptions. [Arbitrum AnyTrust](https://medium.com/offchainlabs/introducing-nova-arbitrum-anytrust-mainnet-is-open-for-developers-9a54692f345e) is an excellent such solution, a significant step forward over sidechains or alt-L1s. Validiums also enable usecases with honest-minority DA layers. The perfect solution, though, is combining the two - an AnyTrust validium, so to speak. Such a construction would have very minimal trade-offs versus a fully secured rollup. You only need one (or two) honest party (which is a similar trade-off to a rollup anyway) and the validium temporarily switches over to a rollup if there’s dissent. Crucially, there’s no viable attack vector for this construction as far as I can see - the validators have nothing to gain, it’ll simply fall back to a zk rollup and their attacks would be thwarted.

I will point out that these honest-minority DA layers can certainly be permissionless. A simple design would be top N elected validators. Also, there are even more interesting designs like [Adamantium](https://ethresear.ch/t/adamantium-power-users/9600) \- which could also be made permissionless.

The end result is with a validium settling to a permissionless honest-minority data layer, you have security that while clearly inferior than a full Ethereum rollup, are also significantly superior than an alt-L1, sidechain, or even a validium settling to an honest-majority data layer (like Avail or Celestia) in varying magnitudes. Finally, with volitions, users get the choice, at a per-user or per-transaction level. This is without even considering those using the wide ocean of alternate data solutions, such as Metis.

Protodanksharding increases system requirements by approximately [8 Mbps and 200 GB hard drive](https://twitter.com/epolynya/status/1513868637307691009) (note: can be hard drive, not SSD, as it’s sequential data). In a world where 5G and gigabit fibre are proliferating, and [30 TB hard drives are imminent](https://twitter.com/epolynya/status/1532940630275461121), this is a pretty modest increase, particularly relative to the 1 TB SSD required - which is the most expensive bottleneck to Ethereum nodes currently. Of course, statelessness will change this dynamic, and danksharding light clients will be awesome - but they are not urgent requirements. Meanwhile, bandwidth will continue [increase 5x faster than compute](https://twitter.com/apolynya/status/1545807412560465920), and hard drives & optical tapes represent [very cheap solutions to historical storage](https://polynya.mirror.xyz/EpFL1V1amxa8maE-TyjfiifJMij_KZNMvReTDxpVoA4), so EIP-4844 can continue expanding and accommodating more transactions on rollups for the usecases that really need full Ethereum security. Speaking of how cheap historical storage is, external data layers can easily scale up to millions of TPS today when paired with validium-like constructions.

Validity proofs can be quite large. If we have, say, 1,000 zk rollups settling a batch every single slot, they can add up and saturate big parts of protodanksharding. But with recursive proofs, they don’t need to settle every single slot. You effectively have a hybrid - sovereign rollups every second, settled rollups every minute or whatever. This is perfectly fine, and at all times come with only an honest-minority trust assumption assuming a decentralized setup.

One route is to not cancel danksharding outright, but just implement it much later. I think Ethereum researchers should continue developing danksharding, as they are the only team building a no-compromise DA layer. We will see alternate DA layers implement it (indeed, DataLayr is based on danksharding, with some compromises) - let them battle-test it for many years. Eventually, danksharding becomes simple and battle-tested enough - maybe in 2028 or something - we can gradually start bringing some sampling nodes online, and complete the transition over multiple years.

Finally, sincerely, I don’t actually have any strong opinion. I’m just an amateur hobbyist with zero experience or credentials in building blockchain systems - for me this is a side hobby among 20 other hobbies, no more and no less. All I wanted to do here was provide some food for thought. Except that data will be negligibly cheap and data availability sampled layers (basically offering a product with unlimited supply, but limited demand) will accrue negligible value in the current paradigm - that’s the only thing I’m confident about.",132.0,2022-07-22 03:55:47,0.98

Delivering on planned updates means that Ethereum will most likely remain the king of L1s,"Ethereum was the first multipurpose chain to be created in the crypto space. This along with the fact that it’s very reliable and is the gold standard for decentralization made it the most popular chain to utilize smart contracts (by a landslide too).

The only problem that remains with Ethereum is the scalability issue and this is something that many other L1s and so called “ETH killers” capitalized on.

Ethereum’s team quickly realized that and made plans to generally improve and focus on the aspects of scalability. There are many plans but the most important ones are the merge and Sharding.

So far we’ve seen the successful implementation of merging which will eventually make Ethereum very eco-friendly.

The next update will be Sharding which will most probably come in 2023. This will make other L1s competing with Ethereum basically irrelevant simply because Ethereum will become extremely scalable with Sharding introduced.

And while Sharding won’t make the blockchain itself scalable, it will most definitely give EVM L2s much more power and leverage.

We’re already seeing huge progress from scaling solutions like Polygon now that they introduced zkEVM alongside 8 multipurpose scaling solutions to Ethereum all of which are already doing a great job at scaling the blockchain.

But with Sharding this will tech will reach a whole new level and Ethereum will become unrecognizable from what we see it as today.

So as long as Ethereum keeps on delivering on its promises and updates, I truly think that it will stay at the top of the foodchain (foodchain, blockchain, haha) and will make a ton of other competitors basically irrelevant.",28.0,2022-07-20 06:19:21,0.92
The market really tested the ability to survive of every decentralized network/platform in the last several months.,"The crypto market is witnessing crash after crash, with insignificant pumps that are not really doing anything compared to the huge losses investors are enduring - Hopefully, this positive momentum - mostly because of the Ethereum Merge - can be the catalyst for the whole market to finally recover.

All crypto projects were tested for their ability to go through and survive in the last several months, as many investors just panic sold or at least moved to more conservative investments for the time being.

Some networks use different techniques to minimize their losses like diversifying their treasury and allocating more to stablecoins. Some use some nice concepts such as DAFI that can maintain a network in bearish markets, without issuing large quantities of tokens, by allowing decentralized networks to create a synthetic token in a reduced quantity, and as demand rises, the synthetics increase in quantity.",21.0,2022-07-19 19:31:18,0.89

**Frequently Asked Questions**

**Where's the best place to buy ETH?**

There are many centralized exchanges that support Ethereum. If you live in the US, the most popular exchanges are Coinbase, Gemeni and Kraken. Coinbase users can use Coinbase Pro for lower fees.

**When is Eth2 launching?**

Eth2 is a marketing term used to represent a number of updates to Ethereum. The Eth2 proof-of-stake chain first launched in December 2020. ""The Merge"", which is the event that will fully switch Ethereum's consensus to proof-of-stake, is estimated to be ready in early 2022, although there is no exact timeline. Other updates, such as data shards, will follow that update.

Visit [ethmerge.com](https://ethmerge.com/) to learn more about ""The Merge"".

**Do I need to do anything to update to Eth2? Will Eth2 create a new token?**

No, ETH holders *never* need to take any action to keep holding ETH. Ethereum users will be unaffected by the Eth2 upgrade. And the Eth2 updates will not create any new tokens.

**How can I stake my ETH?**

The best way to stake your ETH: by running your own validator.

* Running your own validator requires a modern computer and 32 ETH. Visit /r/ethstaker for more details

**Why are Ethereum transaction fees so high?**

Like most blockchains, Ethereum fees are determined by supply-and-demand. The large demand to use Ethereum has pushed transaction fees quite high (however, fees were just a few cents only 2 years ago). Fees are especially high during market volatility, and during NFT drops.

**What is being done to lower Ethereum transaction fees?**

Ethereum fees are reduced by using layer-2 rollups. Rollups are scaling solutions that allow for significantly cheaper transactions, while still maintaining Ethereum's security.

Additionally, Eth2's data shards will make rollups even cheaper.

While rollups are cutting-edge technology being actively developed, a number are already live on Ethereum mainnet. Visit [l2beat.com](https://l2beat.com/) to learn more about rollups.

**What's the best wallet for Ethereum?**

The most popular tool for using decentralized applications is Metamask. However, for security reasons, we recommend using a hardware wallet such as a Trezor or Ledger.

Ethereum Merge is looking like the next big thing in the entire crypto space,"As everyone knows, the Ethereum blockchain, one of the world’s foremost decentralized open-source networks suffers from serious scalability issues and a perfect solution to its scalability issues would be the Ethereum Merge.   


What is your opinion, do you really think it's gonna solve many problems Ethereum is dealing with?  


It's no wonder that according to analysts, the Ethereum Merge is looking like the next big thing in the entire crypto space. The Ethereum Merge will also see a strategic move from a Proof-of-Work (PoW) to a Proof-of-Stake (PoS) blockchain.   


What I don't understand quite much, is gas fees, gas fees on Ethereum are usually ridiculously high and the entire network is generally slow. To close this gap, Ethereum reveals plans to launch its ETH 2.0 update. So, does that mean that it may solve problems with high gas fees?  


Does that mean that we wouldn't need to use Metis or any L2 solution? I believe you would all agree that sometimes it's quite impossible to work with Ethereum without L2 solutions.   


As I know gas fees have no relationship with the consensus mechanism in use. They are, however, mostly a function of block space demand. To enjoy reduced gas fees, it is advisable to make use of Layer-2 chains. Right?   


What it's cool for example is that the staking yield on Ethereum will increase by about 50%. The current staking yield stands at about 4.2%, this will increase to over 6% after Ethereum Merge.

A Detailed Summary of Every Single Reason Why I am Bullish on ETH in 2022. (TL;DR at the bottom),"The following will be a list of the many reasons why I still hold and am still extremely bullish on ETH. This is the third updated version of this post since the [first one I made in 2020.](https://old.reddit.com/r/ethtrader/comments/jhrqv1/a_detailed_summary_of_every_single_reason_why_i/)

#This is an extremely long post. If you just want the hopium without the detail, read the TL;DR at the bottom.

#~~ETH 2.0~~ The Merge

The switch from Proof of Work to Proof of Stake also known as “The Merge” (formerly known as ETH 2.0) has numerous enormous benefits for Ethereum. These include: 

- A 99.9% increase in power efficiency, making Ethereum by far the largest environmentally friendly blockchain.
- Greater network security than PoW provides due to efficiencies with PoW and the new ability for the protocol to “slash” or punish dishonest validators/attackers.
- An ~80-90% drop in ETH inflation from around 5%pa to well below 1%pa and these inflation numbers are excluding ETH burned from transaction fees which based on recent fees will turn ETH into a deflationary asset. This will reduce the current daily sell pressure of $20,000,000/day of new ETH being sold by miners to offset electricity costs to just $2,000,000-$5,000,000/day going to stakers who will sell less due to not having any significant operating expenses to pay off. Furthermore, these stakers won’t even be able to withdraw their earnings until after a later hard fork months after the merge.
- An increase in ETH 2.0 staking rewards from the current 4-5% to [possibly as high as 7.5-15% due to miner/validator extractable value and network fees/tips.](nitter.snopyta.org/drakefjustin/status/1384124998084792324) ^(The 25% value in that tweet is out of date and no longer likely.)

At this rate, the merge will go live later this year, likely in September. Lately there has been a series of successful shadow forks for merge testing as well as the Ropsten testnet which has successfully switched to Proof of Stake.

#Extended Ethereum Roadmap

The extended Ethereum roadmap includes a wide range of very promising and forward thinking features which will keep Ethereum on the bleeding edge of blockchain tech for a long time. The roadmap was recently outlined by Vitalik and along with the aforementioned merge upgrade, it includes the following categories:

- **Surge:** Scalability for rollups through data sharding. This effectively allows rollups to scale another 100x from their current levels.

- **Verge:** Introduces stateless clients which means the blockchain can be verified without needing the complete history of the blockchain which came before it. This allows validators to run without the need for a large hard drive, dramatically reducing the hardware requirements to run a node, thus improving decentralisation.

- **Purge:** Technical debt elimination and elimination of historical data. This comes in multiple forms such as historical data expiry, state expiry and the removal of numerous other unnecessary functions. Much of this will make node operation and validating much easier as well as simplifying the wider Ethereum codebase.

- **Splurge:** Numerous miscellaneous upgrades such as proposer builder separation, account abstraction and zkSNARK-ifying everything. These will further lighten the load for node operators and give smart contract wallets more functionality.

It is worth noting that these upgrades won’t all rollout together under the above names like the merge. The above names are simply categories for different upgrades. These upgrades within each category will come at different times.

#EIP-1559 and ETH scarcity

As I covered a while ago in [a previous post of mine,](https://old.reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/izhkvk/minimum_viable_issuance_why_ethereums_lack_of_a/) ETH doesn’t have a supply cap like Bitcoin. Instead, it has a monetary policy of “minimum viable issuance”, not only is this is a good thing for network security, but with the recent addition of EIP-1559, net ETH issuance is variable due to its fee burning feature. During times when network demand is high, transaction fees can rise to levels at which the amount of fee revenue being burned is greater than the inflation rate from new ETH issuance going to miners (and stakers post-merge). In effect, this fee burn acts a lot like a company such as Apple using profits to perform share buybacks, except instead of Apple using money from selling iPhones to reduce the supply of Apple shares, Ethereum is using the profits it makes from selling scarce, decentralised block space to reduce the supply of ETH. This creates a constant negative supply side pressure which without a matching reduction in demand, will lead to ETH price appreciation.

So what does this mean for ETH scarcity? It means that if the Ethereum economy is healthy and there is a constant demand for Ethereum’s scarce, decentralised block space, there will be a sink in the form of the fee burn which reduces the supply of ETH. If the fee burn is high enough, the fee burn can outweigh the new issuance being minted for miners and stakers. This threshold is around 100-150 Gwei under Proof of Work and around 10-15 Gwei post-merge/under Proof of Stake.

The long term prediction for ETH supply according to Ethereum researcher Justin Drake is that supply will peak just before the merge just below 120 million ETH before decreasing post-merge where over time the burn will lessen relative to new issuance before ETH supply eventually floats around 100-120 million ETH or continues to decrease at a slow rate. You can create your own post-merge issuance models by playing around with the variable inputs on [ultrasound.money.](https://ultrasound.money)

#Layer 2 Scaling

One of the most under appreciated aspects of Ethereum is its forward-thinking rollup centric scaling roadmap which is sometimes referred to as a “modular blockchain” architecture. Meanwhile many “Ethereum killers” or alternative layer one general purpose blockchains are still trying to scale with the outdated “monolithic blockchain” architecture and are having to compromise on one of the three elements of the blockchain scalability trilemma, scalability, decentralisation and security. But I won’t go on about this, I’ll let u/Liberosist convince you about the superiority of [Ethereum’s rollup centric roadmap and the modular blockchain thesis.](https://polynya.medium.com/rollups-data-availability-layers-modular-blockchains-introductory-meta-post-5a1e7a60119d) What’s important here is that this model of scaling effectively flips the blockchain scalability trilemma on its head, allowing Ethereum to scale, become more decentralised and secure all at once.

Optimistic rollups and ZK rollups have been live on main net Ethereum for a while now. Arbitrum and Optimism have a very wide range of DApps and can offer transactions for less than a dollar and token swaps for not much more, all while retaining the Ethereum main chain’s security guarantees. Meanwhile, ZK rollups such as ZK sync offer even cheaper transactions at less than 10¢ per transfer with full Ethereum base layer security. Finally, rollups are only just getting started. There are many optimisations which have been proposed and will soon roll out such as EIP-4488 and call data compression. Together, [these could boost throughput and cut fees by as much as 50x.](https://np.reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/r26hhv/rollupcentric_ethereum_roadmap_november_2021/) As previously mentioned, rollups flip the blockchain trilemma on its head, meaning that the more people that use them, the cheaper they get and the more secure Ethereum becomes!

#DeFi and Composability

If you’re reading this, I am sure you are aware of the phenomena which is Decentralised Finance (AKA DeFi or more accurately, open finance). Ethereum was the first and is still by far the largest platform to offer permissionless and immutable financial services which when interacting with each other, lead to unprecedented composability and innovation in financial applications. A whole new world of possibilities are opening up thanks to this composability as it allows anyone to take existing pieces of open source code from other DeFi projects, put them together like lego pieces (hence the term money legos) and create something the world has never seen before. None of this was possible before Ethereum because typically financial services are heavily regulated and FinTech is usually proprietary software, so you don’t have any open source lego bricks to build off and you have to build everything you need from scratch. That is if what you want to do is even legal for a centralised institution!

#NFTs and tokenisation

NFTs or “Non-Fungible Tokens” – We’ve all heard of them by now. This once niche aspect of the Ethereum community has exploded into the mainstream through almost unprecedented hype and speculation in the modern era. Since then, they have received a lot of flak, and in some cases, rightfully so. The reality is that the future is not buying a JPEG of a cartoon ape which gives you nothing more than commercial rights to said JPEG and being able to flex your ownership of this NFT to others. The NFTs which have staying power and create real value will be the ones which have utility. This could be something directly practical like an [ENS name](https://ens.domains/) which allows you to use a human readable address for your wallet such as vitalik.eth, or it could be something more innovative and subjective in its value like a community token released by a musician which gives you many perks like private groups, special deals and even financial benefits such as tokenised song royalties.

#Institutional Adoption

Ethereum is by far the most widely adopted blockchain by enterprises. Ethereum’s [Enterprise Ethereum Alliance](https://entethalliance.org/) (EEA) is the largest blockchain-enterprise partnership program and Ethereum is by far the most frequently leveraged blockchain for proof of concepts and innovation in the blockchain space by enterprises. Meanwhile, there are protocols like the [Baseline protocol](https://docs.baseline-protocol.org/) which is a shared framework which allows enterprises to use Ethereum as a common frame of reference and a base settlement layer without having to give up privacy when settling on the public Ethereum mainnet. This framework makes adopting Ethereum much easier for other enterprises. Another example is EY’s “Nightfall”, a Zero Knowledge optimistic rollup which provides full privacy and cheaper transactions for enterprise use.
 
#Institutional Investment

This latest bull run was characterised by the beginning of institutional acceptance of cryptocurrencies as an asset class. Exposure to the space is becoming easier and easier for large institutions with custodial firms for institutional investment and hedge funds exposed to crypto offering their products left and right. But it doesn’t stop there with Ethereum. As businesses transact on Ethereum and better understand it, not only will they buy up ETH to pay for their transactions, but they will also realise that much like Bitcoin, Ethereum is a scarce asset. Better yet, a scarce asset which offers yield when staking. The first major mover in this field is Cloudflare who [recently announced](https://blog.cloudflare.com/next-gen-web3-network/) that they are buying and running their own staking nodes to help secure the network.

#Improvements in user onboarding and abstracting away complexity

Ethereum has started making huge leaps forward in terms of usability for the end user. The aforementioned ENS names is a huge UX improvement which is equivalent to the huge leap forward for the internet which was DNS. No longer do you have to check every character of your ugly hexadecimal 0x43AB96D… ETH address to ensure you’re sending your ETH to the right person. Another major improvement is the advent of smart contract wallets like [Argent wallet](https://www.argent.xyz/). Argent allows for users to access their wallets and interact with DeFi self-custodially from an app on their phone without having to record a private key or recovery phrase. Instead, they offer social recovery and their UI is straight forward enough for anyone who uses a smart phone to understand. Finally, for the more experienced users, DApps like Uniswap have pretty, super easy to use graphical user interfaces and can be used by anyone who knows how to run and use a browser extension like Metamask. While at times the Metamask UX still has a way to go to get to mass adoption levels of user friendliness, there have been improvements in the last year such as EIP-1559. EIP-1559 has removed the old gas price guessing game and subsequent waiting for an uncertain length of time for your transaction to be accepted. Metamask has also added a feature which allows you to switch networks to other chains or L2s in once click instead of having to manually add the RPC endpoints.

The user experience will continue to get better until it gets to the point where it is just like email today. So easy that even your grandmother can tap a couple of buttons and use DeFi without even knowing anything about how it works.

#The lack of an obvious #1 ETH killer

One of Ethereum’s biggest threats is for it to be overthrown by a so-called “Ethereum killer” blockchain which claims to do everything Ethereum can do and sometimes more. However, one of the biggest hurdles to overthrowing Ethereum is finding consensus over its biggest competitor. Ethereum is by far the biggest, most decentralised and politically neutral smart contract platform which gives it a snowball effect of attracting most of the new users and builders in web 3.0. Furthermore, this gives it a stamp of legitimacy which other projects don’t have.

The best way to measure the adoption of a layer 1 chain is to compare the fee revenue. This is because blockchains sell block space and the fee revenue is the sum of money which people are willing to pay to access that block space. Ethereum’s fees in the last 24 hours (while I am writing this) total $3.9 million. Compare this to BNB (a network which doesn’t try to compete with Ethereum as a truly decentralised platform) which had $600,000 in fees in those same 24 hours. The next largest smart contract platform (one which actually claims to be decentralised) is Avalanche at just over $30,000. This means that Ethereum provides 100x the value to its users than its closest true competitor does. Source: https://cryptofees.info/

#Network effects

This is another topic which I made a [previous post on.](https://old.reddit.com/r/ethtrader/comments/guffdj/the_network_effect_is_king_what_i_have_learned/) The network effect is why Bitcoin is still the number one cryptocurrency and by such a long way. Bitcoin is not the most technologically advanced cryptocurrency. However, it has the most widespread name recognition and largest market cap. The network effect is also why most people use Zoom and Facebook Messenger/WhatsApp despite the existence of free, private, end to end encrypted alternatives which have all the same features (https://meet.jit.si/ for a Zoom alternative and Signal for the private messenger app. I highly recommend both. Let’s get their network effects going!). It is the same for Bitcoin. People have heard of Bitcoin and many understand it already. Many people don’t want to have to learn about or set up a wallet for alternative options. People like what is familiar and what other people use. Nobody wants to be “that guy” who makes you download yet another app and account you have to remember the password/private key for. In the same way, Enterprises don’t want to have to create a bridge between their existing systems and a dozen different blockchains. Developers don’t want to have to create DeFi money legos from scratch on a new chain if they can just plug in to existing services like Uniswap and AAVE. Likewise, users don’t want to have to download another browser extension to use DApps on another chain if they already use Ethereum. This is also why the vast majority of Ethereum killers are effectively just Ethereum clones with different specifications. The reason for this is of course because it is easier to build and onboard new users and apps if the experience is familiar and developers can port over existing applications rather than build them again from scratch.

#Ethereum is the most decentralised and provably neutral smart contract platform

Ethereum is also the most decentralised and provably neutral smart contract platform. Unlike some of the competing smart contract platforms, you can’t round up everyone at the Ethereum Foundation or any select group of people and expect to be able to stop the network. Not only this, but the Ethereum foundation doesn’t have the ability to print more ETH or push through changes on a whim like some people would lead you on to believe. The community would reject detrimental EIPs and hard fork. Ever since the DAO hack, the Ethereum community has made it clear that it will not accept EIPs which attempt to roll back the chain even to recover hacked funds (see EIP-999).

Attacking Ethereum’s Proof of Stake beacon chain would be extremely costly and require a very large amount of money or influence over staking entities. In its current state, an attacker would need to control 66.7% of the >400,000 validators on the beacon chain to control the network. At the current moment, even the largest four custodial staking providers such as Coinbase and Kraken only add up to 34% of the total stake.

Finally, with the US dollar looking like it will lose its reserve currency status and the existing wire transfer system being outdated, superpowers like China won’t want to use US systems and the US won’t want to use a Chinese system. Enter Ethereum, the provably neutral settlement layer where the USA and China don’t have to trust each other or each other’s banks because they can trust Ethereum. While it may sound like a long shot, it does make sense if Ethereum hits a multi-trillion dollar market cap since it will be the most secure and politically neutral way to transfer value between adversaries. Not to mention if much of the world’s commerce were to be settled in the same place — on Ethereum — then it would make sense for governments to settle on the same platform. While this future is a long way away, it is very much a possibility.

#ETH distribution is decentralised

Thanks to around 7 years of proof of work — a system where miners have to sell newly mined ETH to pay for electricity costs — newly mined ETH has found its way into the hands of everyday people who buy ETH off miners selling on exchanges. As pointed out by u /AdamSC1 in [his analysis of the top 10K ETH addresses](https://medium.com/@adamscochran/the-10k-audit-42c100dd32bb) (I highly recommend reading this if you haven’t already), the distribution of ETH is actually slightly more decentralised than Bitcoin with the top 10,000 ETH wallets holding 56.70% of ETH supply compared to the top 10,000 Bitcoin wallets which hold 57.44% of the Bitcoin supply. This decentralised distribution means that the introduction of staking won’t centralise ETH in the hands of a few wallets who could then control the network. This is an advantage for ETH which many proof of stake ETH killers will never have as they never used PoW to distribute funds widely throughout the community and these ETH killers often did funding rounds giving large numbers of tokens to VC investors.

#The community

Finally, while I may be biased, I think that Ethereum has the friendliest community. Anecdotally, I find that the Ethereum developer community is full of forward thinking people who want to make the world a better place and build a better future, many of whom are altruistic and don’t always act in their best interests. Vitalik is one of the best examples of this. Vitalik holds less than 0.3% of the total ETH supply, a remarkably small percentage for any founder of a multi-billion dollar company or cryptocurrency (for reference, Jeff Bezos owns about 10% of Amazon and Satoshi owns about 5% of all Bitcoins). Not to mention his many charitable donations, including $1 billion dollars worth of SHIB sent to the Indian COVID relief fund (sure, there wasn’t $1 billion worth of liquidity in those SHIB tokens but it’s still a hell of a lot of money) and $5 million to aid in Ukraine among many other charitable donations. Compare this to the much more conservative, “at least we’re safe while the world burns” attitude which many Bitcoiners have. I don’t want to generalise too much here as the Bitcoin community can be great too and there are some wonderful people there. But the difference is clear if you compare the daily discussion of r/Bitcoin to the incredibly helpful and welcoming daily discussion of r/EthFinance who will [happily answer your noob questions without calling you an idiot and telling you to do you own research](https://old.reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/jh3zyy/daily_general_discussion_october_24_2020/g9vg1jw/) (there are plenty more examples in any of the daily threads). Or the very helpful folks over at r/EthStaker who will go out of their way to help you set up an Ethereum beacon chain staking node on the mainnet or testnet. Don’t believe me? Head over to those subs and see for yourself.

**Please don’t hate on me if you disagree about which project has the best community, it is just my very biased personal opinion and I respect your opinion if you disagree! :)**

#TL;DR: 
- **The Merge** - A ~ 90% drop in ETH issuance, beginning the era of deflationary ETH, AKA [ultra sound money](https://external-content.duckduckgo.com/iu/?u=https%3A%2F%2Fi.imgur.com%2FDyjJE5u.jpg&f=1&nofb=1). Furthermore, staking yields will rise post merge. Plus, the merge starts the more secure and more environmentally friendly future of Ethereum.
**Extended Ethereum Roadmap** - The surge, the verge, the purge and the splurge offer a wide range of benefits and features which will dramatically increase Ethereum’s capabilities.
- **EIP-1559 and ETH scarcity** - Ethereum is now the first actually profitable blockchain which doesn’t need constant inflation to pay for network security. This translates to ETH the asset actually remaining scarce and the Ethereum network secure.
- **Layer 2 Scaling** - Rollups and a “modular blockchain” architecture flip the blockchain trilemma on its head to allow Ethereum to scale while maintaining, or even increasing security and decentralisation. 
- **DeFi and Composability** - Money legos and open source code allowing for fast development and unprecedented innovation in the world of finance.
- **NFTs and tokenisation** - Tokenise everything. No, seriously. NFTs will be so much more than just art NFTs.
- **Institutional Adoption** - Ethereum has the most enterprise partners (EEA) + the Baseline protocol and Nightfall are bullish AF. 
- **Institutional Investment** - We have seen the beginning of institutional acceptance of crypto as an asset class but understanding is still very poor. It is a matter of time before more yield chasing institutions discover ETH, the deflationary, dividend paying/stakeable, environmentally friendly, more advanced version of Bitcoin.
- **Improving UX and abstracting away complexity** - Human readable addresses and smart contract wallets which even your mother could use. Even MetaMask and DApps are getting easier too.
- **The lack of an obvious #1 ETH killer** - No ETH killer clearly sticks out from the rest. This makes it hard for one of them to create a big network effect. Furthermore, their actual value created is more than 100x lower than Ethereum’s.
- **Network effects** - Ethereum has by far the largest network effect and as Bitcoin has shown us, the network effect is extremely important.
- **Ethereum is the most decentralised and provably neutral smart contract platform** - Super secure under Proof of Stake, no more tolerance of DAO like forks and a neutral platform for geopolitical adversaries on the world stage to settle on, removing the need for them to have to trust each other’s banking systems.
- **ETH distribution is decentralised** - Years of proof of work have put ETH in the hands of many. In fact, ETH supply is more decentralised than the supply of Bitcoin.
**The community** - Super duper mega friendly. Shoutout to r/ETHStaker and r/ETHFinance!

This could be something directly practical like an [ENS name](https://ens.domains/) which allows you to use a human readable address for your wallet such as vitalik.eth, or it could be something more innovative and subjective in its value like a community token released by a musician which gives you many perks like private groups, special deals and even financial benefits such as tokenised song royalties.

#Institutional Adoption

Ethereum is by far the most widely adopted blockchain by enterprises. Ethereum’s [Enterprise Ethereum Alliance](https://entethalliance.org/) (EEA) is the largest blockchain-enterprise partnership program and Ethereum is by far the most frequently leveraged blockchain for proof of concepts and innovation in the blockchain space by enterprises. Meanwhile, there are protocols like the [Baseline protocol](https://docs.baseline-protocol.org/) which is a shared framework which allows enterprises to use Ethereum as a common frame of reference and a base settlement layer without having to give up privacy when settling on the public Ethereum mainnet. This framework makes adopting Ethereum much easier for other enterprises. Another example is EY’s “Nightfall”, a Zero Knowledge optimistic rollup which provides full privacy and cheaper transactions for enterprise use.
 
#Institutional Investment

This latest bull run was characterised by the beginning of institutional acceptance of cryptocurrencies as an asset class. Exposure to the space is becoming easier and easier for large institutions with custodial firms for institutional investment and hedge funds exposed to crypto offering their products left and right. But it doesn’t stop there with Ethereum. As businesses transact on Ethereum and better understand it, not only will they buy up ETH to pay for their transactions, but they will also realise that much like Bitcoin, Ethereum is a scarce asset. Better yet, a scarce asset which offers yield when staking. The first major mover in this field is Cloudflare who [recently announced](https://blog.cloudflare.com/next-gen-web3-network/) that they are buying and running their own staking nodes to help secure the network.

#Improvements in user onboarding and abstracting away complexity

Ethereum has started making huge leaps forward in terms of usability for the end user. The aforementioned ENS names is a huge UX improvement which is equivalent to the huge leap forward for the internet which was DNS. No longer do you have to check every character of your ugly hexadecimal 0x43AB96D… ETH address to ensure you’re sending your ETH to the right person. Another major improvement is the advent of smart contract wallets like [Argent wallet](https://www.argent.xyz/). Argent allows for users to access their wallets and interact with DeFi self-custodially from an app on their phone without having to record a private key or recovery phrase. Instead, they offer social recovery and their UI is straight forward enough for anyone who uses a smart phone to understand. Finally, for the more experienced users, DApps like Uniswap have pretty, super easy to use graphical user interfaces and can be used by anyone who knows how to run and use a browser extension like Metamask. While at times the Metamask UX still has a way to go to get to mass adoption levels of user friendliness, there have been improvements in the last year such as EIP-1559. EIP-1559 has removed the old gas price guessing game and subsequent waiting for an uncertain length of time for your transaction to be accepted. Metamask has also added a feature which allows you to switch networks to other chains or L2s in once click instead of having to manually add the RPC endpoints.

The user experience will continue to get better until it gets to the point where it is just like email today. So easy that even your grandmother can tap a couple of buttons and use DeFi without even knowing anything about how it works.

#The lack of an obvious #1 ETH killer

One of Ethereum’s biggest threats is for it to be overthrown by a so-called “Ethereum killer” blockchain which claims to do everything Ethereum can do and sometimes more. However, one of the biggest hurdles to overthrowing Ethereum is finding consensus over its biggest competitor. Ethereum is by far the biggest, most decentralised and politically neutral smart contract platform which gives it a snowball effect of attracting most of the new users and builders in web 3.0. Furthermore, this gives it a stamp of legitimacy which other projects don’t have.

The best way to measure the adoption of a layer 1 chain is to compare the fee revenue. This is because blockchains sell block space and the fee revenue is the sum of money which people are willing to pay to access that block space. Ethereum’s fees in the last 24 hours (while I am writing this) total $3.9 million. Compare this to BNB (a network which doesn’t try to compete with Ethereum as a truly decentralised platform) which had $600,000 in fees in those same 24 hours. The next largest smart contract platform (one which actually claims to be decentralised) is Avalanche at just over $30,000. This means that Ethereum provides 100x the value to its users than its closest true competitor does. Source: https://cryptofees.info/

#Network effects

This is another topic which I made a [previous post on.](https://old.reddit.com/r/ethtrader/comments/guffdj/the_network_effect_is_king_what_i_have_learned/) The network effect is why Bitcoin is still the number one cryptocurrency and by such a long way. Bitcoin is not the most technologically advanced cryptocurrency. However, it has the most widespread name recognition and largest market cap. The network effect is also why most people use Zoom and Facebook Messenger/WhatsApp despite the existence of free, private, end to end encrypted alternatives which have all the same features (https://meet.jit.si/ for a Zoom alternative and Signal for the private messenger app. I highly recommend both. Let’s get their network effects going!). It is the same for Bitcoin. People have heard of Bitcoin and many understand it already. Many people don’t want to have to learn about or set up a wallet for alternative options. People like what is familiar and what other people use. Nobody wants to be “that guy” who makes you download yet another app and account you have to remember the password/private key for. In the same way, Enterprises don’t want to have to create a bridge between their existing systems and a dozen different blockchains. Developers don’t want to have to create DeFi money legos from scratch on a new chain if they can just plug in to existing services like Uniswap and AAVE. Likewise, users don’t want to have to download another browser extension to use DApps on another chain if they already use Ethereum. This is also why the vast majority of Ethereum killers are effectively just Ethereum clones with different specifications. The reason for this is of course because it is easier to build and onboard new users and apps if the experience is familiar and developers can port over existing applications rather than build them again from scratch.

#Ethereum is the most decentralised and provably neutral smart contract platform

Ethereum is also the most decentralised and provably neutral smart contract platform. Unlike some of the competing smart contract platforms, you can’t round up everyone at the Ethereum Foundation or any select group of people and expect to be able to stop the network. Not only this, but the Ethereum foundation doesn’t have the ability to print more ETH or push through changes on a whim like some people would lead you on to believe. The community would reject detrimental EIPs and hard fork. Ever since the DAO hack, the Ethereum community has made it clear that it will not accept EIPs which attempt to roll back the chain even to recover hacked funds (see EIP-999).

Attacking Ethereum’s Proof of Stake beacon chain would be extremely costly and require a very large amount of money or influence over staking entities. In its current state, an attacker would need to control 66.7% of the >400,000 validators on the beacon chain to control the network. At the current moment, even the largest four custodial staking providers such as Coinbase and Kraken only add up to 34% of the total stake.

Finally, with the US dollar looking like it will lose its reserve currency status and the existing wire transfer system being outdated, superpowers like China won’t want to use US systems and the US won’t want to use a Chinese system. Enter Ethereum, the provably neutral settlement layer where the USA and China don’t have to trust each other or each other’s banks because they can trust Ethereum. While it may sound like a long shot, it does make sense if Ethereum hits a multi-trillion dollar market cap since it will be the most secure and politically neutral way to transfer value between adversaries. Not to mention if much of the world’s commerce were to be settled in the same place — on Ethereum — then it would make sense for governments to settle on the same platform. While this future is a long way away, it is very much a possibility.

#ETH distribution is decentralised

Thanks to around 7 years of proof of work — a system where miners have to sell newly mined ETH to pay for electricity costs — newly mined ETH has found its way into the hands of everyday people who buy ETH off miners selling on exchanges. As pointed out by u /AdamSC1 in [his analysis of the top 10K ETH addresses](https://medium.com/@adamscochran/the-10k-audit-42c100dd32bb) (I highly recommend reading this if you haven’t already), the distribution of ETH is actually slightly more decentralised than Bitcoin with the top 10,000 ETH wallets holding 56.70% of ETH supply compared to the top 10,000 Bitcoin wallets which hold 57.44% of the Bitcoin supply. This decentralised distribution means that the introduction of staking won’t centralise ETH in the hands of a few wallets who could then control the network. This is an advantage for ETH which many proof of stake ETH killers will never have as they never used PoW to distribute funds widely throughout the community and these ETH killers often did funding rounds giving large numbers of tokens to VC investors.

#The community

Finally, while I may be biased, I think that Ethereum has the friendliest community. Anecdotally, I find that the Ethereum developer community is full of forward thinking people who want to make the world a better place and build a better future, many of whom are altruistic and don’t always act in their best interests. Vitalik is one of the best examples of this. Vitalik holds less than 0.3% of the total ETH supply, a remarkably small percentage for any founder of a multi-billion dollar company or cryptocurrency (for reference, Jeff Bezos owns about 10% of Amazon and Satoshi owns about 5% of all Bitcoins). Not to mention his many charitable donations, including $1 billion dollars worth of SHIB sent to the Indian COVID relief fund (sure, there wasn’t $1 billion worth of liquidity in those SHIB tokens but it’s still a hell of a lot of money) and $5 million to aid in Ukraine among many other charitable donations. Compare this to the much more conservative, “at least we’re safe while the world burns” attitude which many Bitcoiners have. I don’t want to generalise too much here as the Bitcoin community can be great too and there are some wonderful people there. But the difference is clear if you compare the daily discussion of r/Bitcoin to the incredibly helpful and welcoming daily discussion of r/EthFinance who will [happily answer your noob questions without calling you an idiot and telling you to do you own research](https://old.reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/jh3zyy/daily_general_discussion_october_24_2020/g9vg1jw/) (there are plenty more examples in any of the daily threads). Or the very helpful folks over at r/EthStaker who will go out of their way to help you set up an Ethereum beacon chain staking node on the mainnet or testnet. Don’t believe me? Head over to those subs and see for yourself.

**Please don’t hate on me if you disagree about which project has the best community, it is just my very biased personal opinion and I respect your opinion if you disagree! :)**

#TL;DR: 
- **The Merge** - A ~ 90% drop in ETH issuance, beginning the era of deflationary ETH, AKA [ultra sound money](https://external-content.duckduckgo.com/iu/?u=https%3A%2F%2Fi.imgur.com%2FDyjJE5u.jpg&f=1&nofb=1). Furthermore, staking yields will rise post merge. Plus, the merge starts the more secure and more environmentally friendly future of Ethereum.
**Extended Ethereum Roadmap** - The surge, the verge, the purge and the splurge offer a wide range of benefits and features which will dramatically increase Ethereum’s capabilities.
- **EIP-1559 and ETH scarcity** - Ethereum is now the first actually profitable blockchain which doesn’t need constant inflation to pay for network security. This translates to ETH the asset actually remaining scarce and the Ethereum network secure.
- **Layer 2 Scaling** - Rollups and a “modular blockchain” architecture flip the blockchain trilemma on its head to allow Ethereum to scale while maintaining, or even increasing security and decentralisation. 
- **DeFi and Composability** - Money legos and open source code allowing for fast development and unprecedented innovation in the world of finance.
- **NFTs and tokenisation** - Tokenise everything. No, seriously. NFTs will be so much more than just art NFTs.
- **Institutional Adoption** - Ethereum has the most enterprise partners (EEA) + the Baseline protocol and Nightfall are bullish AF. 
- **Institutional Investment** - We have seen the beginning of institutional acceptance of crypto as an asset class but understanding is still very poor. It is a matter of time before more yield chasing institutions discover ETH, the deflationary, dividend paying/stakeable, environmentally friendly, more advanced version of Bitcoin.
- **Improving UX and abstracting away complexity** - Human readable addresses and smart contract wallets which even your mother could use. Even MetaMask and DApps are getting easier too.
- **The lack of an obvious #1 ETH killer** - No ETH killer clearly sticks out from the rest. This makes it hard for one of them to create a big network effect. Furthermore, their actual value created is more than 100x lower than Ethereum’s.
- **Network effects** - Ethereum has by far the largest network effect and as Bitcoin has shown us, the network effect is extremely important.
- **Ethereum is the most decentralised and provably neutral smart contract platform** - Super secure under Proof of Stake, no more tolerance of DAO like forks and a neutral platform for geopolitical adversaries on the world stage to settle on, removing the need for them to have to trust each other’s banking systems.
- **ETH distribution is decentralised** - Years of proof of work have put ETH in the hands of many. In fact, ETH supply is more decentralised than the supply of Bitcoin.
**The community** - Super duper mega friendly. Shoutout to r/ETHStaker and r/ETHFinance!

Can someone explain the benefits of staking ethereum?,"Seems like 3-5% apy on cex or pooled staking platforms isn’t really worth the opportunity cost of liquidity, especially when the merge deadline keeps getting pushed back.

Why would staking be better than just holding ethereum? If the price stays low, even after the merge, wouldn’t it have been better to just hold ethereum which you can liquidate if you need to sell out?

Is the apy really worth giving up your cash’s liquidity? Or am I missing some other benefits? Plus it seems like 32 ethereum to actually run a node to get the full apy wouldn’t even be worth running. For example if I make 0.3 in staking rewards per year on 10 ether, wouldn’t that take around 30 years to make back the principle I put down to stake? Like with annuities, your principle is protected, but crypto is so volatile you could be getting 3% apy but lose 80% of your principle from price fluctuations cause your crypto is locked up.

How would the benefit of 3% apy be worth locking up your crypto and having to weather the price changes instead of being able to sell out and buy back lower? I get that it’s hard to time the market, but with the merge always getting pushed back why would 3% apy be attractive to investors? You essentially lock up your capital for an unknown amount of time just for a small amount of extra crypto.

Am I missing something? Is there some sorta long term benefit post merge to staking? Or is it really just lock up all your money for an unspecified time for small apy gains",33.0,2022-06-28 22:50:51,0.74

**Frequently Asked Questions**

**Where's the best place to buy ETH?**

There are many centralized exchanges that support Ethereum. If you live in the US, the most popular exchanges are Coinbase, Gemeni and Kraken. Coinbase users can use Coinbase Pro for lower fees.

**When is Eth2 launching?**

Eth2 is a marketing term used to represent a number of updates to Ethereum. The Eth2 proof-of-stake chain first launched in December 2020. ""The Merge"", which is the event that will fully switch Ethereum's consensus to proof-of-stake, is estimated to be ready in early 2022, although there is no exact timeline. Other updates, such as data shards, will follow that update.

Visit [ethmerge.com](https://ethmerge.com/) to learn more about ""The Merge"".

**Do I need to do anything to update to Eth2? Will Eth2 create a new token?**

No, ETH holders *never* need to take any action to keep holding ETH. Ethereum users will be unaffected by the Eth2 upgrade. And the Eth2 updates will not create any new tokens.

**How can I stake my ETH?**

The best way to stake your ETH: by running your own validator.

* Running your own validator requires a modern computer and 32 ETH. Visit /r/ethstaker for more details

**Why are Ethereum transaction fees so high?**

Like most blockchains, Ethereum fees are determined by supply-and-demand. The large demand to use Ethereum has pushed transaction fees quite high (however, fees were just a few cents only 2 years ago). Fees are especially high during market volatility, and during NFT drops.

**What is being done to lower Ethereum transaction fees?**

Ethereum fees are reduced by using layer-2 rollups. Rollups are scaling solutions that allow for significantly cheaper transactions, while still maintaining Ethereum's security.

Additionally, Eth2's data shards will make rollups even cheaper.

While rollups are cutting-edge technology being actively developed, a number are already live on Ethereum mainnet. Visit [l2beat.com](https://l2beat.com/) to learn more about rollups.

**What's the best wallet for Ethereum?**

The most popular tool for using decentralized applications is Metamask. However, for security reasons, we recommend using a hardware wallet such as a Trezor or Ledger.

"The merge will do wonders for Ethereum, but what I think will truly show the full potential of Ethereum is sharding","Many people have been anticipating the merge for a long while now (myself included) and with it getting nearer and nearer it’s starting to get more and more attention.

However, I think Sharding deserves just as much, if not more, excitement and anticipation.

While implementing both the merge and sharding is necessary to make Ethereum the ultimate blockchain with built in scalability and efficiency, Sharding definitely has a more significant role doing that.

Scaling solutions are already doing an amazing job on their own and getting tons of funding and partnerships. Loopring is working with GameStop and other Zk-based scaling solutions like Zksync working with Bitdao which funded them with $200 million to develop Zkdao (which will apparently be a scaling solution focused solely on DAOs) and this is not mentioning the wide list of developments happening in the L2 sector right now.

So imagine all of this but even WAY more consistent, faster, cheaper and overall more efficient. It would make Ethereum seriously overpowered when compared to other blockchains.

This would be great news for the entire market cause it will push competition into higher levels and make blockchains work harder to deliver a faster and cheaper platform.",45.0,2022-06-21 00:03:10,0.98
ETH’s price is lower than 2017 ATH yet development is more active than ever before,"I’m really not trying to be that a##hole that says “I don't care about the price” cause obviously that’s a lie. I hate losing money just like everyone else.

Price is obviously very important, however, I truly think that cumulative development is way more important when viewing a project that you believe in long term. And right now, Ethereum is experiencing a slew of developments and upgrades.

Let’s not forget that the merge is on its way and sharding will follow next. Also, Ethereum’s ecosystem is expanding at an ever-increasing rate, way higher than what competitors are experiencing right now.

Scaling solutions are also doing their job at improving the Ethereum blockchain. Polygon alone has already invested hundreds of millions of dollars in efforts to scale Ethereum. They already have more than 6 scaling solutions (Miden, Nightfall, Avail, Zero, Hermez, PoS) mobilizing both optimistic and zero-knowledge technology.

So while the price action isn’t as bullish as we’d want it to be, I still think that development is more bullish than it has ever been before. That alone gives me more reason to hold and possibly even buy more as soon as I’m capable of doing so.",29.0,2022-06-20 20:35:04,0.94
"ETH currently cheaper than its 2017 peak - 4.5 years wiped out of the market. Meanwhile, DeFi works, NFTs work, DAOs work, and there are more developers building on Ethereum than ever before. Issuance is reducing and the Merge is coming this ""Crypto Winter"". Fundamentals could not be stronger. GLTA!","The bottom on ETH is in, in my humble opinion. You take it or leave it.

Therefore, I just bought 3 more ETH for $3,500 in long-term cash (unlevered).

As you all should know, not long ago (actually this April), ETH was at about $3500 each!!!

Now I can get 3 ETH for the price of about 1 ETH ;-)) What a deal if you ask me!!!

I'll continue to stack (BTFD), stake and HODL ETH to the richest!!! GLTA!!!

Ethereum needs to find a better PoS design before they merge. The state of Eth PoS right now is total centralized garbage all because of poor design.,"If Ethereum merges to PoS now, the whole network can be controlled by 3 entities who don't even own 51% of the stake, the coins are given to their custody by users. 

The reason is very simple, the design is as bad as I could possibly imagine.

1. There is no non custodial staking (only running your own node), the reason for that is because of slashing. You cannot slash coins that you don't own, so everyone who owns less than 32 Eth can either give his coins to some corporation or not stake at all.

2. You need 32 Eth to run your own validator node, which ofcourse is too much for an average Joe, meaning giving custody of his coins is the only way of staking for him.

Lately youtubers/influencers and other stupid people  started to advertise how decentralized Eth PoS is, they like to throw around the number of validators number, without giving any context to it. To me that is newbie hunting advertising and I think everyone who do that is total shithead of a person, that is Luna/Solana/Avax type of advertising and considering how much Eth did for crypto space so far and  how big it is, they should absolutely avoid this kind of marketing.

To explain: they say Eth has 400,000 validators and the second  best is Cardano with 2,000 validators. They took this opportunity to say Eth is 200 times more decentralised than the second best PoS LMAO, absolutely not.
This stat only tells us there is 400,000x32 Eth staked, while more than 200,000 of those ""validators"" is owned by Coinbase, Kraken and Lido (it doesn't matter if your coins  are locked via smart contract, the validators are not operated by SC but by people)

To add to that only 10% of the coins are currently staked, so these 3 companies could control the entire Eth network with 0 stake in the network. All they need is/was that other users lock 5% of total circulating coins with them and the HW to run the validator nodes

So at this stage and with this design Eth must absolutely not merge, this would be awful decentralisation.

Maybe if it isn't too late they should just do ouroboros and forget slashing. At least the % of circulating supply needed to control the network would rise, since people could stake without custodian and chose smaller validator groups/pools.

Besides what harm does slashing do to a custodian, who is staking other peoples coins? Why should they care if their clients coins get slashed?",33.0,2022-06-19 20:50:08,0.56
"Whoever has doubts about Ethereum’s future… calm down, it still has a ton of development on the way from merging to sharding to much more","Call me biased if you want but I don’t think any other blockchain is as consistent and safe as Ethereum especially when you take into consideration that it has the most diverse and rich ecosystem in the entire market.

The only people who have fears are the ones that still aren’t used to how the market moves in times like this, but the reality is that this might be one of the most bullish phases for Ethereum considering how much development is on the way.

The merge isn’t that far away right now and it will make Ethereum WAY more efficient with around 99% less energy consumption.

Sharding will come after that and will basically put all scaling solutions on steroids, especially ones that are ZK-based.

It's no wonder why so many L2s and scaling solutions are starting to shift towards ZK tech, a lot of them starting t develop some neat stuff. Polygon out of all been at the forefront of ZK development with more than $1 billion allocated just for that and even 4 ZK-based scaling solutions in their arsenal right now.

This will make gas fees a redundant issue and will make Ethereum unrecognizable. So if you’ve always liked Ethereum then you’re going to love it pretty soon.

Honestly, I’m just excited at everything that will roll out soon and couldn’t care less about any FUD I see anywhere.",779.0,2022-06-19 20:23:25,0.91
Celsius Drama Explained,"&#x200B;

**For those of you involved in the crypto space, you have most likely heard people talking about “Celsius” and how it is affecting the whole market. In this first crypto classrom series we will look at what Celsius is, explain what is happening, and discuss the potential fallout from this situation.**

# What Is Celsius?

Celsius is a crypto lending platform that has been around since 2017 and aims to give users yield on their crypto assets. This platform allows users to deposit their assets, which Celsius can then lend out to users who seek to borrow assets in the form of a loan.

So why would someone want to lend or borrow crypto assets?

Let us look at an example. Let’s say you own 1 Ethereum. You would then go to Celsius, deposit your Ethereum, which now sits in a big Ethereum pool on the Celsius network. A different Celsius user may be interested in borrowing 1 Ethereum because they want a loan for more money to use for trading. This new user pays Celsius a fee to borrow the Eth, and then they receive 1 Eth in their account to do with as they please until they decide to return the Eth. While the new user has your Eth, you still have a share that can be redeemed for 1 Eth, and you get paid interest. You get your interest, the borrower gets a loan, and both parties benefit. Celsius offered APYs of approximately 8% interest on Bitcoin and Ethereum. Users could also receive around 7% interest on stablecoins, which was treated as a much more lucrative alternative to a savings account in a bank. Many users own these big assets and stablecoins already, so many thought why not put them on the Celsius platform to earn some extra interest? The allure of extra yield is what allowed for a platform like Celsius to get as big as it did.

# How Does it Generate Yield?

In the crypto world, many are not equipped to understand where “yield” comes from.  In many cases, projects tell you how they believe their project will earn money, but that does not guarantee things will work out as they hope. Celsius made a lot of money through arbitrage opportunity (buying assets at a low price from one exchange, then selling them quickly at a higher price on another exchange) and potentially through Anchor protocol on Luna. They offered yield on non-staked assets, which potentially means they were also additionally participating in trading for profits (very risky).

**What Happened?**

At this point, most of you know the crypto market has entered its bear cycle. Prices continue to fall, and financial stress has been put on all investors. This sort of pressure has exposed many vulnerabilities in the market that would not be seen in a bull cycle when making money is easy. The model of Celsius has put it in a precarious situation, one that was so grim it suspended all withdrawals. A real-life “pause button” if you will. The reason Celsius needed to hit pause can be summed up by a need for Celsius to generate yield that it could no longer give. Celsius was making easy money during the bull run, and when the market turned bearish, it was forced to lower yields. There are rumors Celsius was putting money into the Anchor protocol on Luna which offered 20% yields. Many companies were earning 20% with user funds in the protocol and then giving users a percentage of the profit. After the collapse of Luna, many companies took a huge blow.

In addition, Celsius was found to have a position with stEth, which is supposed to be a 1:1 version of Eth. stEth is the form of Eth that will be available for use once Ethereum merges. Celsius owned a lot of stEth. However, the peg that keeps stEth in a 1:1 ratio with Eth broke, so stEth was now worth less than original Eth. The turn-off of stEth that once you stake an Eth for stEth is that you can not redeem your Eth until the merge, which means you are locking your funds away. Not something you want to do as markets tank! With few people buying stEth, the market became illiquid, and if Celsius wanted to sell their stEth, they would essentially tank the price of stEth and incur big losses. Combined with the 2 financial blows brought on by Luna and stEth, users were withdrawing funds as fear became extreme in the market. Celsius couldn’t control Luna or stEth, but they decided to control the one thing they could, keeping user funds trapped.

# What Is the Fallout?

The fallout from this Celsius drama is still playing out in front of our very eyes. The impact of this situation will likely be seen financially in the short-term, and regulatory in the mid/long-term. When it comes to the effect on the pricing of assets, the main risk to the whole market would come from Celsius getting liquidated. For those who are unaware, liquidation is the forced selling of assets if someone is losing too much money on their loan. When someone wants a crypto loan, they need to put money/assets up to back their loan. Think of it as insurance. You can’t walk into a bank and ask for a $1 million loan and tell them you promise you’re going to pay it back. You must give them money as protection in case you lose all the loan money and can’t repay the loan. The money given to the bank (or the loan lender) is known as “collateral”. In the case of Celsius, they own approximately 24k Bitcoins worth around $530 million. Based on the terms of their loan, the liquidation threshold for those Bitcoin is just around $15k. This means that as things stand if Bitcoin’s price hit the threshold, it would trigger the sale of those 24K Bitcoins, likely driving the price of Bitcoin down even further. Celsius could continue to fend off a liquidation by adding more collateral and lowering the price of a liquidation threshold. However, this strategy is incredibly risky, as doubling down and trading on margin rarely ends well. There are some rumors that Celsius does not have the money to repay its loan, which would essentially nuke the company to nothing if prices continued downward. This level of risk has forced Celsius to pause its platform as they try and figure things out.

The fact Celsius was able to pause all trading is a move that will without a doubt change the crypto landscape going forward. Many users of Celsius have their assets locked inside, and they are left wondering if they will ever get them back. In the crypto world, there is a phrase “not your keys not your crypto”, meaning that if you aren’t keeping coins in your own wallet, you don’t necessarily own your crypto outright. This situation has shown how true this is. Celsius could be a sinking ship, and they may be taking all their user’s assets down with it. If this is the case, crypto lending platforms will be under the watchful eyes of regulators moving forward.

Need help on how to continue after the merge,"Hi everyone,  
I have been staking Ethereum for more than a year now, but up until now I do not run my own node, but using various services like Infura instead. I know all guides mentioned that it is suggested to run a node, but as I am using AWS I wanted to avoid the high storage cost of doing so.   
Now I recently found out that after the merge this will not be possible anymore and I am not sure what to do now.   
I would like to setup the node at home, e.g. on a NUC, again to save on the costs for storage of EC2 instances, but as this was not planned I have a few things I am uncertain about:  


\- My network on avg is 60 Mbps down/ 15 Mbps up, will this be sufficient?  
\- My staking node is located in us-east while I am living in Europe. Will the added latency be a problem?  
\- I guess for setting up the ETH node itself there are plenty of guides out there, can you recommend one?  


I would really appreciate any help and suggestions on how to prepare myself for the merge!  
Thank you in advance!",26.0,2022-06-16 11:41:12,0.93
Why do you suppose ETH has fallen so far. so fast?,"I just took a quick peek at the top 20 coins by market cap and over the last SEVEN days Ethereum has plummeted 32.03% as of this writing.

Only 2 other cryptos have fallen more, and barely:CRO has dropped 32.99%, but I believe a large part of that is due to the rate change and unbonding periods ending and sell of out of spite.

AVAX has dropped 32.62%, I don't know about this coin so I won't even surmise a reason why.

**Frequently Asked Questions**

**Where's the best place to buy ETH?**

There are many centralized exchanges that support Ethereum. If you live in the US, the most popular exchanges are Coinbase, Gemeni and Kraken. Coinbase users can use Coinbase Pro for lower fees.

**When is Eth2 launching?**

Eth2 is a marketing term used to represent a number of updates to Ethereum. The Eth2 proof-of-stake chain first launched in December 2020. ""The Merge"", which is the event that will fully switch Ethereum's consensus to proof-of-stake, is estimated to be ready in early 2022, although there is no exact timeline. Other updates, such as data shards, will follow that update.

Visit [ethmerge.com](https://ethmerge.com/) to learn more about ""The Merge"".

**Do I need to do anything to update to Eth2? Will Eth2 create a new token?**

No, ETH holders *never* need to take any action to keep holding ETH. Ethereum users will be unaffected by the Eth2 upgrade. And the Eth2 updates will not create any new tokens.

**How can I stake my ETH?**

The best way to stake your ETH: by running your own validator.

* Running your own validator requires a modern computer and 32 ETH. Visit /r/ethstaker for more details

**Why are Ethereum transaction fees so high?**

Like most blockchains, Ethereum fees are determined by supply-and-demand. The large demand to use Ethereum has pushed transaction fees quite high (however, fees were just a few cents only 2 years ago). Fees are especially high during market volatility, and during NFT drops.

**What is being done to lower Ethereum transaction fees?**

Ethereum fees are reduced by using layer-2 rollups. Rollups are scaling solutions that allow for significantly cheaper transactions, while still maintaining Ethereum's security.

Additionally, Eth2's data shards will make rollups even cheaper.

While rollups are cutting-edge technology being actively developed, a number are already live on Ethereum mainnet. Visit [l2beat.com](https://l2beat.com/) to learn more about rollups.

**What's the best wallet for Ethereum?**

The most popular tool for using decentralized applications is Metamask. However, for security reasons, we recommend using a hardware wallet such as a Trezor or Ledger.

I’m not worried about the future of Ethereum. The fundamentals are still there.,"What’s happening is very frustrating and a lot of people are panicking especially newcomers. But this is normal and it has happened a good amount of times.

What I really care about are the fundamentals and development. Once you see those starting to decline, know that a project is doomed.

With Ethereum though, this isn’t the case. There’s a ton of development happening right now and there are many events and plans that will soon start unrolling.

The merge will happening pretty soon and after that comes sharding all of which will add to the value of ETH.

L2s are also making Ethereum a more superior and developed blockchain with projects like Polygon allocating $1 billion solely towards ZK development and has already released its anticipated Supernets now that Ethereum became ZK centric.

All of this combined indicates that Ethereum’s core and fundamentals are still intact. The market is just going through a recessive period as all markets do. If anything, it’s unnatural for a market not to go through a recessive period every now and then.",37.0,2022-06-13 01:39:06,0.86
Ethereum 2.0 staking pools remain immune to cryptowinter,"Decentralized finance (or DeFi) platforms are not going through their best year. So far in 2022, more than 3,000 ethers (ETH), Ethereum's cryptocurrency, were withdrawn from these protocols. The only DeFi market that seems to remain attractive to investors are the staking pools of the 2.0 version of the network. 

It is worth clarifying that we are referring to liquid staking pools, which allow you to withdraw your investment at any time. These have had a sustained growth in deposits for most of the year. And, since May, after a significant drop, the amount of ETH on these platforms has remained stable. 

However, it seems that neither the projects involved, nor the upcoming pre-launches in which some DeFi protocols are involved, such as Ownex and the upcoming launch of Minosis Token and LunaFi, will be affected.

We will take as a representative example Lido, a pool that currently holds more than 30% of all ETH in staking. This decentralized pool seems not to be suffering from the current bear market.  

According to the DeFi Llama portal, ETH deposited on the platform peaked at over 6 million ETH. A 100% growth compared to the end of 2021.  

In contrast, in the rest of the DeFi market on Ethereum (not including staking pools) there is a constant withdrawal of ETH.

Ethereum is preparing for a transition where proof-of-work (PoW) mining will cease to exist on the network giving way exclusively to proof-of-stake (PoS) staking. 

Currently, ETH is the most profitable cryptocurrency to mine with graphics cards (GPUs). According to the Whattomine portal, ETH is 20% more profitable than its closest competitor.  

As the transition from PoW to PoS occurs, which is estimated to occur this year with the merger (""The Merge""), miners may have begun to see staking as an option. 

At the time of this publication, Ethereum 2.0 staking pools offer a return of close to 4% per year for depositing ETH into their smart contracts.",39.0,2022-06-12 18:26:17,0.77
Ethereum below $1500; How much deeper should we expect? Could the Merge Salvage this Token?,"Ether fell below its 2018 bull run peak of $1,440, touching $1,423 and that's some really blood red for quite a number of traders and investors.

The title says it all -- but he also says Polkadot is ETH 1.5.

Look, I've been an ADA bag holder for a while now, but this is just petty at this point. Literally no reason to believe Charles has any inside info and is doing anything other than taking a (poorly-timed) shot at his old colleagues. I believe in ADA tech-wise, but as long as Charles is the face of the coin, I think it's more likely to go the way of LUNA and Do Kwon than a viable ETH competitor.

Choosing Proof-of-Stake Over Mining Is Ethereum’s Biggest Mistake and Here Is Why,"Years ago, Ethereum developers decided to quit cryptocurrency mining. And now, on June 8th, Ethereum’s test network called Ropsten will host [the merge](https://ethereum.org/en/upgrades/merge/) to shift to staking and abandon mining completely. On that day, only the test network will get an update, while the main cryptocurrency network will get it sometime in the near future. It means that staking is coming. In this article we are going to explain why quitting GPU mining is Ethereum’s biggest mistake.

"So, what's actually stopping us from forking Ethereum when it goes PoS?","Hey guys!

I'm not exactly the most knowledgeable about blockchain programming and all but what exactly is stopping us from forking Ethereum when it goes PoS? The difficulty bomb that was diffused and replanted many times already? Just fork the chain (or create a new Ethereum copy) and diffuse the bomb, might as well revert the mining part of EIP 1559 while we're at it. Then let this new (old?) Ethereum compete with all other coins, all dApps and other stuff should have a version in that blockchain that the original creators can go back to if the PoS in Ethereum doesn't go as well as they imagine, which seem quite possible. 

Of course, it's not a guarantee that it will have as much value (see ETC) but it seems more likely to me that a copy of Ethereum as it currently is right now, with all the applications it has running right now, will succeed than any other coin that couldn't take a decent slice of Ethereum's market so far.

Ethereum's Hashrate Surpasses Lifetime High as The Merge Gets Closer,"On June 2, It was reported that the top five mining pools controlled more than 71% of Bitcoin's hashrate in May https://news.bitcoin.com/ethereums-hashrate-surpasses-lifetime-high-as-the-merge-gets-closer/ . BTC's hashrate was around 200 exahash per second (EH/s) at the time, and the leading crypto asset was mined by 16 known mining pools.

While Bitcoin has 16 known mining pools, the top five command more than 70% of the network's hashrate, Ethereum has 78 pools dedicated to the chain. Projects like Concordium which is a proof of stake crypto and Axie Infinity not in the top five.

Ethermine, Ethereum's largest mining pool, commands 296.69 terahash per second (TH/s), while F2pool, the second-largest pool, commands 151.46 TH/s. Poolin, Hiveon, and 2miners come after Ethermine and F2pool. The top five ether mining pool metrics together produce 0.745 percent of Ethereum's global hashrate.

According to Saturday's data, Ethereum's hashrate reached 132 PH/s, as the hashpower metric reached a new high in 2022. The ATH occurred at block height 14,902,285 and was 3.93% higher than the ETH hashrate metrics recorded on May 13 and 30 (127 PH/s). 

This year's record highs coincide with The Merge, when the network will be fully transitioned to a proof-of-stake (PoS) blockchain protocol. When the transition is complete, the 78 mining pools that have dedicated hashpower to the Ethereum chain will have to mine another network.

ETH miners can choose from a variety of crypto networks, including ethereum classic (ETC), ubiq (UBQ), musicoin (MUSIC), callisto (CLO), and quarkchain (QKC). In terms of profitability, Ethereum's consensus algorithm Ethash is the most profitable at the time of writing, followed by the consensus algorithm Kadena. 

Furthermore, three other consensus algorithms, Scrypt, X11, and Cuckatoo32, are more profitable than SHA256 (BTC's algorithm). Following The Merge, however, the consensus algorithm Ethash is unlikely to be the most profitable algorithm to mine due to the removal of ethereum (ETH) mining capabilities.",111.0,2022-06-05 17:37:27,0.97
"The longer I'm in crypto, the more I lean toward Ethereum Maximalism","In 4 days time the Ropsten test merge will happen, turning the Ropsten testnet from POW to Proof of stake.  On the 30th june, the difficulty bomb will go off, gradually increasing the difficulty for miners to mine blocks.  The data can be found here: 

Http://wenmerge.com

And in an as yet unspecified date in august, the real main net merge will happen.  So why am I so bullish about the merge?  Its largely Eth moving instantly from 3.3% inflation to -0.7% inflation. But it's also these. 

1. 99% reduction in energy cost per Tx. 
2. 90% issuance reduction.  12500 eth a day to 1250. 
3. Miner sell pressure drops from 14,000 eth a day to 0. 
4. More eth locked in the staking contract for 6 months after the merge . 
5. Deflationary asset.  More eth burned than produced if gwei >20gwei.  

Number 3 is I think the most important. While it wont drop to exactly 0 on the first night, removing $30 million of sell pressure per day will have a massive effect.  The market would need to refind this pressure just to stop the price going up. (Its guaranteed profit). It wont find this sell pressure.  

There won't be a 'massive selloff' on merge night.  All eth remains locked into the contract until the next update.  After that, there is a queued release. 

I believe that both Bitcoin and Ethereum are stores of value,  but Ethereum is currently also the worlds largest and most secure crypto network.  It is the foundation of web3.  

As a final note, it took 19 months to get 12.6 million into the deposit contract.   In the last 2 months alone,  2.6 million of that amount was deposited.  

As a final final note, I'd like to thank Do Kwon for causing the luna crash and allowing us to buy Eth this cheap, this close to the merge.  And also removing luna from the market and allowing Ethereum more room to grow in MC.  You're a bastard, make no mistake; but you're a magnificent one.

Hayes says Ethereum could Hit $10k by End of 2022; Could that be a Hyperbole or a statement of fact?,"Michael Hayes who is the former CEO of Bitmex just said that Ethereum could Hit a price of $10k by the end of the year 2022.

Yea, I know this sounds rather audacious considering how distant $10k is from its current price value of about $1,800.

But Hayes sure gave some reasons which according to him could lead to this spike in ETH price… and yea Hayes affirms that even amidst the current turbulence the crypto market is experiencing,  $10k is a feasible mark for ETH.

He believes that once the ETH transitions to a proof-of-stake (POS) system like BNBchain, Zetrix, and Cardano, ETH will now be commodity-based or a “currency bond” as opposed to BTC, which is just pure money…. knowing that there's so much push for this transition for a proof-of-stake mechanism because it is eco-friendly compared to the proof-of-work mechanism

As reported in 
https://bitcoinist.com/ethereum-can-hit-10k-by-end-of-2022/

Hayes holds the conviction that ETH is superior to BTC because “ETH is a commodity used to power the computer, not a pure monetary instrument, and hedging your ETH/USD or local currency would mean you receive income or a premium of +6.90%.""

Yea, I know the ETH merge is happening soon,  but isn't $10k too much of a mark… how about we say maybe a $4k price value.

ETH/USD Forecast: Ethereum Continues to Look Flat,"Ethereum has done nothing during the trading session on Thursday, remaining at $1800. This is interesting because it does not appear that Ethereum has a real chance of going higher, so I believe we are in for a bit of a breakdown. 

This is consistent with the rest of the crypto markets, which, to be honest, looked bleak. With that in mind, I believe it is only a matter of time before we see significantly lower pricing.

Longer-term, I believe Ethereum has a future, but you will most likely be able to purchase Ethereum at much lower prices. We are entering ""crypto winter,"" a period in which cryptocurrency does almost nothing and puts everyone to sleep. People will eventually reconsider their options and begin purchasing cryptocurrency including less proof of stake cryptos like Solana which saw a major rise in 2021, Concordium in which transactions on it are fast and cheap, and Decentraland a play to earn token again. However, the last crypto winter lasted approximately 3 12 years. Do not be surprised if it is shorter this time, but at the end of the day, it is difficult to imagine that we will not enter crypto winter because, quite frankly, crypto has yet to find its footing.

Despite the fact that we have been hearing about the possibilities for years, there is currently no real-world application of cryptocurrency. People eventually grow tired of it and get rid of it. The fact that we have seen so many Ponzi schemes in the last year or two has also reduced trust in cryptocurrency to near zero. If institutional money does not enter the market, it is difficult to imagine Ethereum taking off overnight. 

Furthermore, the merge has been excruciatingly slow, and I just read yesterday that 1.3 million transactions failed on the blockchain in the previous month. This is not a good sign, and it appears that crypto has a long way to go before it can be a truly viable technology. If that's the case, it stands to reason that cryptocurrency will pay the price.",42.0,2022-06-03 17:22:16,0.85
Are GPUs becoming more affordable due to Ethereum's upcoming merge?,"GPUs or Graphics Processing Units, which are mainly used to mine ethereum, are becoming less expensive. This is possible because the network plans to convert from a proof-of-work or PoW model to a proof-of-stake or PoS one.

 And rendering these computer parts completely worthless for all those mining ethereum.


Leveraging information from Tom's Hardware, CoinDesk found that the valuation for top GPU units on eBay had plummeted by 37 percent since May 2021, when Chinese officials announced a further ban on cryptocurrency mining in the nation.


However, the price decline has increased this year. Ethereum developers explore the PoS approach and the value of the second-largest cryptocurrency plummets.


On the online platform, the value of ten key GPU models fell by 7.4 percent in January, 9.5 percent in February, and 12 percent in March. According to Tristan Gerra, executive director and lead analyst for semiconductors at investment group Robert W. Baird, cryptocurrency mining accounts for around 35 percent of worldwide customer needs for GPUs. GPU miners ""are not truly investing in new hardware at the present time, since valuations have been significant for a while."" This was basically said by Joe Downie, chief marketing manager at hash power broker NiceHash. Instead, ""most of them are probably trying for when Ethereum shifts to PoS, to snap up the secondhand GPUs"" from people who will actually give up when the switch happens. Currently ETH moves closer to its new ecosystem, many Web 3.0 projects like Polygon, faith tribe, Tron and Theta will benefit as the web 3.0 ecosystem as whole will become more cost efficient. 


According to Haohao, a marketing representative from Xuxin Science and Technology, a firm that resells mining rigs in China, the situation in Ukraine reduced cryptocurrency prices in February. This condition makes mine less viable, and so GPU values fell even further.

 According to Haohao, approximately 20 percent to 30 percent of cryptocurrency mining hardware in China has been basically sold since the shutdown.",78.0,2022-06-01 18:18:36,0.79
Plenty Introduces The New Token Bridge: Tokens From Ethereum To Tezos Within Five Minutes,"The New Plenty Ethereum/Tezos Bridge

Plenty is a Decentralized Finance (DeFi) platform on Tezos. Plenty offers several opportunities to earn through staking, farming, and adding liquidity.

At the beginning of this year, Plenty added a flat curve stable swap, which allows you to swap the XTZ wrapper cTez for XTZ with low slippage.  

Also earlier this year, Plenty announced that Plenty And Wrap Protocol would merge.  

Today, they have announced the successful launch of the Plenty bridge: a decentralized bridge between Ethereum and Tezos.

Through this bridge, users can transfer their tokens USDC, DAI, USDT, BUSD, WBTC, WETH, LINK, and/or MATIC to the Tezos blockchain and back in a decentralized manner.

Previously, the token transfer time was nearly an hour, but thanks to the quick finality of Tezos last upgrade the transfer takes just 5 minutes.

Bridges from Avalanche, Polygon, and Binance Smart Chain will launch in the near future.

**Frequently Asked Questions**

**Where's the best place to buy ETH?**

There are many centralized exchanges that support Ethereum. If you live in the US, the most popular exchanges are Coinbase, Gemeni and Kraken. Coinbase users can use Coinbase Pro for lower fees.

**When is Eth2 launching?**

Eth2 is a marketing term used to represent a number of updates to Ethereum. The Eth2 proof-of-stake chain first launched in December 2020. ""The Merge"", which is the event that will fully switch Ethereum's consensus to proof-of-stake, is estimated to be ready in early 2022, although there is no exact timeline. Other updates, such as data shards, will follow that update.

Visit [ethmerge.com](https://ethmerge.com/) to learn more about ""The Merge"".

**Do I need to do anything to update to Eth2? Will Eth2 create a new token?**

No, ETH holders *never* need to take any action to keep holding ETH. Ethereum users will be unaffected by the Eth2 upgrade. And the Eth2 updates will not create any new tokens.

**How can I stake my ETH?**

The best way to stake your ETH: by running your own validator.

* Running your own validator requires a modern computer and 32 ETH. Visit /r/ethstaker for more details

**Why are Ethereum transaction fees so high?**

Like most blockchains, Ethereum fees are determined by supply-and-demand. The large demand to use Ethereum has pushed transaction fees quite high (however, fees were just a few cents only 2 years ago). Fees are especially high during market volatility, and during NFT drops.

**What is being done to lower Ethereum transaction fees?**

Ethereum fees are reduced by using layer-2 rollups. Rollups are scaling solutions that allow for significantly cheaper transactions, while still maintaining Ethereum's security.

Additionally, Eth2's data shards will make rollups even cheaper.

While rollups are cutting-edge technology being actively developed, a number are already live on Ethereum mainnet. Visit [l2beat.com](https://l2beat.com/) to learn more about rollups.

**What's the best wallet for Ethereum?**

The most popular tool for using decentralized applications is Metamask. However, for security reasons, we recommend using a hardware wallet such as a Trezor or Ledger.

The Ramifications Couldn't have Been Greater for Ethereum's Merger. What do you think of the Upcoming merger?,"Crypto investors are looking forward to the end of May, a month that has brought nothing but losses. And, while it's too soon to say whether the worst is over—Bitcoin is currently trading below $30,000 as this has taken its toll on Altcoins including relatively new ones like Solana which is one of the largest transaction network; Concordium which is a fast and cheap transaction network e.t.c and could fall further—it appears that the industry will weather the storm just fine. So long as the Ethereum merger goes smoothly. 

If you've been living under a crypto rock, ""The Merge"" refers to the long-awaited upgrade to the Ethereum blockchain, which will see the No. 2 cryptocurrency switch to a proof-of-stake model, removing concerns about Ethereum's environmental impact and dramatically improving transaction speed.

The Merge is the most recent name (the previous one was Ethereum 2.0) for a process that has been ongoing for years and has been postponed numerous times. However, Ethereum experts, including co-founder Vitalik Buterin, are now predicting that the event will take place in August when the Beacon chain (a parallel Ethereum blockchain that is serving as a proof-of-stake test) merges with the main Ethereum chain. 

They had better be correct. Crypto desperately needs a win right now, and Ethereum pulling off the most significant upgrade in blockchain history would provide it. It would show that the Ethereum community, which is known for being friendly but frivolous, is capable of doing serious business.

It could also spark a significant ETH price increase. 

While Ethereum's chances of completing the merger appear promising, there are also reasons to be concerned. The Beacon chain experienced a so-called ""block reorganization"" event this week, in which its blockchain forked for seven consecutive blocks—something that hasn't happened in years. While the cause appears to be benign, it triggered a brief period of uncertainty because the emergence of multiple, competing Ethereum chains following the merger would be disastrous.

To their credit, the elite developers assisting in the merger have worked patiently and methodically to ensure that the new Ethereum blockchain is ready for prime time. And, as Kraken CEO Jesse Powell stated on a recent episode of Decrypt's gm podcast, he is unconcerned about the numerous delays that have plagued the merger process, because success is more important than speed in a situation of this magnitude. 

Powell is correct, but the Ethereum merger cannot continue for much longer. Further delays will elicit accusations that the Ethereum community is unprepared for the task, and it is possible that the blockchain's gas fee woes, which are a major impediment to crypto's mainstream adoption, will never be resolved. Failure by Ethereum to move beyond the energy-intensive proof-of-work system would provide additional ammunition to environmentalists and politicians who already have a grudge against the crypto industry. 

The bottom line is that the stakes for the merger could not be higher, not just for Ethereum, but for the entire crypto industry. Success will restore faith in Web3, whereas further delays or a botched execution will result in a price collapse and a new and nasty Crypto Winter. Everyone in the crypto community, including Bitcoin maxis, should be rooting for Ethereum to pull this off. The alternative is a market much worse than the one we're in right now.",30.0,2022-05-29 20:14:47,0.77
"A Coherent investment thesis looking forward to ""bear market"" and ETH merge","Wrote this as advice to another user in another thread, however I think its useful as its own OP. My general strategy is to DCA into ETH, and soft short it while doing so. I invest in fundamental theses. Here is my framework:

**Why do Cryptocurrency cycles happen?**

Because of the nature of proof of work, and how it works in the original asset with largest capitalization: BTC. BTC security is provided by miners, who have fixed operating costs. BTC emits supply as a subsidy for this security (in addition to txn fees on network), and this emission halves to asymptotically reach 21 million as a supply.

When it does, a structural seller in the market (BTC miners), are less willing to sell at low prices due to fixed operational costs, this causes price to rise. This slow rise attracts smart and dumb money as it goes higher due to incoming capital. This demand is in fiat ($) and does not scale with current price.

However, as price rises, the structural seller (miners) is exponentially more incentivized to sell, and do so. This sell pressure is in native onchain token/asset (BTC) and scales with current price.

Eventually the linear/decaying demand on new mania capital is overtaken by the structural selling. This leads to fear, and further capitulization. Some people, who notice this cycle, stay, and miners of course do not sell below operational cost. So price returns to an equilibrium between natural demand and structural supply, usually higher than before halvening because of those who stayed rather than ran away.

**How do you fundamentally value crypto?**

Blockchains with byzantine fault tolerance, as a whole, is a way to use technology to reduce the economic transaction costs of trust in holding, securing and exchanging value/tokenized value (assets). Their effectiveness at this is determined by **how secure they are to exogenous attacks, how many interesting nodes/users exist on the ledger** and **how long they are expected to live.** Because these factors determine its economic bandwidth, and generally how much capital is likely to risk itself living on said chain.

1. **Security** \-> the economic cost of attacking the chain to censor/roll back transactions or double spend etc. Also includes marginal cost of repeatedly attacking / attacking again.
2. **# Interesting nodes/users** \-> Metcalfe's law; i.e. that upper bound of value of a network, or use cases on network, are determined by # of nodes, as more interesting things can happen (e.g. a telephone network connecting 10 people is less generally useful than one connecting 100,000 people). Another factor related to metcalfe's law is the number of interesting functions/actions other than ""send/receive the native asset"" that exist.
3. **Life expectancy of chain** \-> Lindy effect, mathematical conjecture that you are most likely to observe something in the middle of its lifespan, so if thing X survived for Y years, the life expectancy for thing X is 2Y. Blockchains with value/TVL have a honey pot, the integral of this pot value over the amount of time that the chain has existed and defended against attack successfully; is roughly the ""factor"" for capital's comfort coming into/onto the chain.

This framework coherently explains why BTC market cap is above ETH, and why ETH market cap is biggest compared to all of its alt-L1 competitors. No one has a time machine, so new alt-L1s and new BTC clones can't build lindy, # of interesting nodes, liquidity, security etc. required to sustain an ecosystem around a blockchain.

Crucially, the use case of this new technology has one other limiting factor, computational scalability, which prevents its use in many potential use cases other than simple and complex finance. There is currently no solution to this that does not sacrifice security or # interesting nodes/users (alt-L1s with bigger and quicker blocks lose security, roll ups and zk roll ups lose composability and thus some connection to the existing ETH ecosystem). However, roll ups and newish math like ZKPs allow compression of information and ""verified"" off chain computation/state change, and are the current best solution to scaling that does not sacrifice much security and not all composability. 

**What is a good strategy going forward?**

Because of macro environment and progression/time of the cycle we are in, it is best to accumulate and bet on the downside to hedge catching falling knives. Currently, the dominant monetary system (Fed) is tightening money and capital supply in order to fight inflation/price rise in goods, either a change in that policy, or a fundamental structural change in flows (like a halvening) for either BTC or ETH is needed, as the two chains with biggest lindy and market cap.

Next Fed meeting is in June, likely to still be hawkish or bearish. But certain things that are counter to current gloom and doom: Month to Month inflation is at \~4%, while the more lagging Y to Y CPI print is whats at 8% like so many people cite when shilling their shitcoin bags (""HFSP with 8% inflation dollars!""). This may mean Fed eases on tightening capital supply.

The other counter-narrative to multi-year bear market doomerism is that Ethereum merge will reduce the structural sellers of ETH, since pure Proof of Stake provides a magnitude more security, and high marginal cost of repeated attack, for the same $ of security cost in either fees or seignorage supply inflation. Personally, as a software engineer and experienced trader, I see this as the most unpriced fact by dumb money and even some smart money. This change is a severe similar structural change in flows as a BTC halvening, but less likely to affect assets outside of the ETH ecosystem as it is less dominant in capitalization as BTC.

However structural flows for ETH will benefit from:

* Reduction in security costs, and thus structural sell pressure of about $7-9B a year at current price and mcap. due to merge
* Even low onchain activity from either users or roll ups being sufficient to displace supply from validator seignorage.
* Additional demand from staking yields boosted by MEV (validators and decentralized ETH staking pools with validators can extract MEV)

**Therefore, my strategy is the following:**

1. I DCA $25k-$40k a week into ETH, I lock this ETH in either Aave or Alchemix
2. I borrow at negative interest (Alchemix) or positive low (0.7%) interest (Aave), in ETH, against my DCA'd ETH
3. I exchange said ETH for GLP on Arbitrum (a liquidity pool for a very good decentralized perps exchange that is half stables, and half ETH/BTC/Uni etc.), that pays \~13% APR in ETH, and about 11% APR in GMX
4. If price continues to go down for ETH, the GLP should go down slower, providing a soft short for ETH. If price goes to say $1600, and I sold my borrowed ETH at $1800, I can convert from GLP -> ETH, pay back my loan, and keep difference as additional ETH.
5. If price goes up, the GLP APR should help slowly pay off ETH borrowed (in addition to negative interest on Alchemix)
6. If macro conditions or market conditions change, convert GLP back to ETH, pay off debt or if not enough, convert to rETH and wait for long term hold (years), take hit and burn collateral to sell if  required.

Bias disclaimer: I am currently deploying about $500k in capital behind accumulating Ethereum while Fed / macro is hostile and merge is still to risky to low information market participants to price correctly.",44.0,2022-05-29 19:58:52,0.82

According to the post, Asset Reality services will be free to MetaMask users. However, users may need to cover legal costs should they decide that the route of recovery makes economic sense. For victims whose legal costs are too high, MetaMask and Asset Reality will help them join forces with other victims as a group.
MetaMask is known as the most popular noncustodial cryptocurrency wallet for Ethereum (ETH) and EVM-compatible blockchains, and in a short while, the ethereum merge would see the huge energy-consuming network become a proof-of-stake blockchain network like Solana and zetrix that have a low carbon footprint.

Through this partnership with Asset Reality, Metamask would amongst other things spur some more confidence in Cryptocurrency security… and I guess that is great news for the industry and the metamask community.",54.0,2022-05-28 11:13:35,0.92
Syscoin VS Solana | Comprehensive Analysis 📊,"Today the Syscoin cryptocurrency is becoming more and more popular, and many users believe that it is capable of becoming the second Ethereum. However, what about Solana crypto, which was predicted the same future? Even though both platforms have a lot in common: high performance and speed, low fees, and smart contracts, these crypto projects are entirely different in their architecture. In this article, we try to find out which of the two cryptocurrencies is capable of taking the palm.

Before diving into the technical aspects, it is necessary to consider the history of each of the projects. It indicates the strength of the project’s foundation.

### A Brief History of Solana

Solana is a monolithic Layer 1 blockchain that allows developers to create efficient, fast, and cost-effective decentralized applications. The project was launched in 2017. The founders of Solana are Eric Williams, Greg Fitzgerald, and former Qualcomm and Dropbox developer Anatoly Yakovenko. On March 23, 2020, the Dutch auction of Solana tokens took place. The peculiarity of this sale was that its participants could return up to 90% of the invested funds. In March 2020, the project was released. 

Currently, the project is one of the fastest-growing ecosystems in the blockchain industry. Solana accommodates many different decentralized applications (dApps). Thus, more than several hundred dApps are supported here, including decentralized finance (DeFi), non-fungible tokens (NFTs), and much more.

### A Brief History of Syscoin

https://preview.redd.it/mj7a1bp8iz191.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&s=f6ea2f0fc9b443600719d3b6b68a32bb56a5a092

Syscoin is a project launched in 2014 and has gone through many difficulties and modifications by 2022. Initially, the project was intended to become a decentralized marketplace capable of eliminating intermediaries, reducing fees, and speeding up payments. Nevertheless, a sad fate awaited the project. Shortly after the end of the ICO, most of the collected funds were stolen by a hired escrow agent Moolah. However, the development team did not give up and continued working on the project. In 2016, the Blockchain Foundry was launched, soon releasing the Blockmaster — an e-commerce platform on the blockchain. In 2018, after several improvements, Syscoin 3.0 was released. And in 2021, the project team updated the roadmap providing a vision of Syscoin 4.0 — potentially the fastest, safest, and most decentralized blockchain.

### What Makes Solana Special?

Solana is one of the fastest blockchains, thanks to its unique, innovative infrastructure. The project processes block every 400 milliseconds, which allows for completing transactions in a matter of seconds. The Solana blockchain can support more than 65 thousand transactions per second (TPS), with the ability to increase this speed as the network grows. In addition, the Solana Foundation and the development team strive to provide the lowest possible cost to end-users. Accordingly, the average price of one transaction on the Solana blockchain is $0.00025. Moreover, Solana offers a variety of tools to help developers launch their projects. In addition, developers can easily integrate dApps existing on other blockchains into the Solana blockchain.

The Solana blockchain operates on an eco-friendly Proof-of-History (PoH) consensus algorithm. Each transaction or piece of data receives a unique timestamp that displays the state, index, and data using cryptographically protected hashes. In this way, it can guarantee the order of events and accurately determine the time of data creation. Although PoH is crucial to the consensus model, it is not the primary consensus protocol. Instead, Solana also uses a practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance (pBFT) mechanism called “Tower BFT.” In Solana, stakeholders can delegate their tokens to validators so that they process transactions and protect the network. To date, Solana has more than 1,700 validator nodes, which makes the blockchain entirely secure and decentralized.

In total, developers have implemented eight key technologies to make the Solana blockchain fast, cost-effective, and secure, for example:

* Turbine — a protocol for block propagation, which allows validator nodes to work faster with less electricity consumption.
* Gulfstream — a protocol that helps validators process transactions faster and without delays.
* Seavel — a smart contract protocol that allows parallel processing and improves performance.

These technologies are part of Solana’s monolithic architecture and allow it to achieve competitive speed, low fees, and efficiency.

Nevertheless, Solana’s monolithic architecture is criticized by many experts who predict the success of modular blockchains. Unfortunately, recently Solana has experienced several failures that have allowed to doubt its stability. For example, in September 2021, the Solana blockchain did not process transactions for more than 10 hours. In addition, the crypto community criticizes Solana because of its centralization. About 50% of SOL is owned by venture capitalists, which negatively affects users’ trust.

### What Makes Syscoin Special?

Syscoin is a blockchain with a modular architecture that has absorbed all the best from the two giants, Bitcoin and Ethereum. The Syscoin blockchain is divided into two layers: the first layer is the main Proof-of-Work Syscoin blockchain, which is highly secure since it is merge-mined with Bitcoin. Here, it should be kept in mind that although Bitcoin is criticized for its high electricity consumption and harm to the environment, its blockchain has a top level of security. So, Syscoin is also a Proof-of-Work blockchain that has about 20% of the hash power consumed by Bitcoin. Users who mine blocks in Bitcoin can also simultaneously mine SYS coins without additional costs. Moreover, Syscoin uses a Chainlock technology developed by Dash, reducing network hijacking risk. Since there are more than 2500 master nodes in Syscoin, the network is incredibly decentralized.

The second Syscoin layer is the smart contract layer. Syscoin developers have created a Network Enhanced Virtual Machine (NEVM) that is fully compatible with the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) and allows you to create high-performance, secure, and fast smart contracts with minimum costs. In addition, the developers are implementing ZK-rollups technology, which will allow the Syscoin blockchain to process more than 210 thousand TPS. ZK-rollups technology combines hundreds of transactions into one and generates a zero-knowledge cryptographic proof. Next, a tangle of transactions is sent to validators for verification, after which the smart contract verifies the transactions, and they are added to the block.

Moreover, in Q3 2022, Syscoin expects another update — Validium, which will allow an incredible 4 million TPS throughput. Validium is a kind of ZK-rollups that processes transactions not on-chain but off-chain, which will make the network incredibly faster. Thus, thanks to the modular architecture, the project team achieved a high level of decentralization and scalability without sacrificing security.

The crucial point is that Syscoin allows developers to create crypto projects that comply with regulatory norms. Perhaps this is not such an obvious advantage at the moment. Still, every year, countries’ governments are trying to control more and more companies that use cryptocurrency in their activities. Therefore, creating regulatory compliant projects from the beginning will eliminate headaches in the future.  


### So What’s the Verdict?

To date, Solana is significantly ahead of Syscoin in terms of popularity and market capitalization. The project has already become home to many well-known DeFi applications, such as Serum, Raydium, Solanart, etc. Solana has a strong and dedicated community and influential partnerships and provides a wide range of services. Nevertheless, the developers of Solana are trying to cram all innovative technologies into one blockchain without dealing with sharded chains and Layer 2 scaling solutions. As practice shows, this approach is challenging to implement, and recently the Solana blockchain has often faced congestion and failures. Syscoin is only gaining momentum, and it still has to go through a thorny path. The developers claim that the purpose of Syscoin is to motivate developers to transfer their decentralized applications from Ethereum to the Syscoin blockchain. Thanks to the modular architecture and ZK-rollups technology, Syscoin will be able to achieve unprecedented speed while remaining cost-effective and secure. In addition, Syscoin provides a potentially important feature for developers — to create tokens that meet regulatory requirements. If the Syscoin developers can realize all their plans, the project has every chance of success.

Ethereum Beacon Chain experiences 7 block reorg: What’s going on?,"""This reorg is not an indicator of a flawed fork choice, but a non-trivial segmentation of updated vs out of date client software,"" said Preston Van Loon, a Core Ethereum developer.

On Wednesday, Ethereum's Beacon Chain underwent a seven-block reorganization, or reorg, ahead of the Merge, which is tentatively scheduled for August. 

According to Beacon Scan data, seven blocks from 3,887,075 to 3,887,081 were removed from the Beacon Chain on Wednesday between 08:55:23 and 08:56:35 am UTC. Ethereum is a transaction network similar to Tron and Concordium which is much faster than the Solana network.

The term ""reorg"" refers to an event in which a canonical chain block, such as the Beacon Chain, is knocked off the chain due to a competing block beating it out.

It could be the result of a malicious attack by a resourceful miner or a bug. In such cases, the chain may unintentionally fork or duplicate. 

On this occasion, developers believe that the problem is a result of circumstance rather than a serious flaw such as a security flaw or fundamental flaw, with a ""proposer boost fork"" being highlighted in particular. This is a method of selecting the next block in the blockchain in which specific proposers are given priority.

Core According to Ethereum developer Preston Van Loon, the reorg was caused by a ""non-trivial segmentation"" of new and old client node software and was not necessarily malicious. Vitalik Buterin, co-founder of Ethereum, called the theory a ""good hypothesis."" 
On Wednesday morning, Martin Köppelmann, co-founder of the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)-compatible Gnosis chain, was among the first to highlight the occurrence via Twitter, noting that it ""shows that the current attestation strategy of nodes should be reconsidered to hopefully result in a more stable chain! (proposals already exist)."" 

Van Loon tentatively attributed the reorg to the proposer boost fork, which had not yet been fully implemented, in response to Köppelmann:

“We suspect this is caused by the implementation of Proposer Boost fork choice has not fully rolled out to the network. This reorg is not an indicator of a flawed fork choice, but a non-trivial segmentation of updated vs out of date client software.”

“All of the details will be made public once we have a high degree of confidence regarding the root cause. Expect a post-mortem from the client development community!” he added.

Terence Tsao, another developer, echoed this hypothesis to his 11,900 Twitter followers earlier on Thursday, noting that the reorg appeared to be caused by ""boosted vs. non-boosted nodes in the network and the timing of a really late arriving block:"" 

""Given that the proposer boost is a non-binding change. Because of the asymmetry in the client release schedule, the roll-out occurred gradually. ""Not all nodes updated the proposer boost at the same time.""

Van Loon stated last week at the Permissionless conference that the Merge and switch to proof-of-stake (PoS) could happen in August ""if everything goes as planned."" 

While the reorganization is bound to raise concerns about the potential timeline, Van Loon and the other developers have yet to explain whether it will have any effect at all.",62.0,2022-05-26 19:51:55,0.74
"Aside from The benefits of Proof-of-stake, Would Ethereum' Anticipated Merge Have Any Effect on Its Token Price?","""Proof-of-work Ethereum is set to transition to a Proof-of-stake network through a much anticipated merge with Beacon Chain, thereby marking the end of proof-of-work for Ethereum, and the full transition to proof-of-stake.


As seen on 


https://ethereum.org/en/upgrades/merge/   


This transition to a PoS network just like Solana, Zetrix, BNBChain and many others would eliminate the need for energy-intensive mining, and instead secure the network using staked ether… bringing the network one step closer in realizing the Ethereum vision which is more scalability, security, and sustainability.


Amongst other things, this merge will bring the ability to run smart contracts into the proof-of-stake system, plus the full history and current state of Ethereum, to ensure that the transition is smooth for all ETH holders and users.


Also, once the Merge happens, stakers will be assigned to validate the Ethereum Mainnet. Mining will no longer be required so miners will likely invest their earnings into staking in the new proof-of-stake system just as it is done on Zetrix and Solana PoS networks.


With all of these beautiful features and benefits coming underway, should we expect the Merge to have any effect on the price of Ether token?

"Ethereum is widely known as the world computer, yet it still has almost the exact same block time as when it launched, this is like having a 2015 GPU trying to run CyberPunk 2077","The otherside mint taught me and many others a few lessons; Ethereum is not ready for mass adoption, L2 rollups are the only thing helping it survive and people are sick of paying their kidneys in fees for the sake of good security. Good security should never cost this much, if it does, it means that your “World Computer” needs upgrades. And every singe upgrade needs 8 years of purity testing to go forward, and it’s not like Ethereum will get cheaper with the merge. 

This has led many people, even Yuga Labs who dropped the otherside mint on ETH, to consider other chains, chains that will not break when you’re minting a 100,000 NFTs all at once. How do we fix this? We explore better alternatives until Ethereum catches up, and if it doesn’t, we’ll just congratulate it on the good run. I’ve been exploring AVAX since it launched, LUNA till it crashed, Polygon, and now Cartesi as they’ve literally built a blockchain OS on Linux VM. 

it’s super fun to see where crypto is heading, everyone is exploring literally every single coding language to build the perfect chain. This is great, it brings more people to the space, more institutional money for big firms that missed out on ETH, and will be a great catalyst to kicking off the bull market sooner than ever.",20.0,2022-05-25 12:42:24,0.78
"A decentralized version of r/Superstonk for when the inevitable ""Reddit outage"" occurs as we effectively approach MOASS. Thoughts, tin-foil, my experience with gm.xyz thus far, and migration.","I've removed all links for auto-mod and edited text to remove hyperlinks.

TLDR: gm-dot-xyz is the Web3 (Blockchain) form of Reddit. I believe it would be beneficial for r-forward slash-superstonk to migrate to a decentralized application (dApp) like gm-dot-xyz so that freedom of speech is upheld during MOASS-related outages.

ELI5: A more secure form of Reddit exists as a blockchain app and will avoid errors and disconnections when talking with others.

ELIA: Buy, Hodl, DRS, support GameStop

Here we go!

https://preview.redd.it/mdp39tpyqg191.jpg?width=640&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=bdf6a8dd1b3601f618336cac3dc6202e1ae55a73

**THOUGHTS:**

Reddit is a centralized entity, and regardless of the company's upcoming IPO (where large investors will take part-ownership of the company to influence its direction), the site will likely experience ~~manipulation of free-speech~~ outages as users from around the world flood to the ""front-page of the internet"" to understand what is happening to the World's economy.

To reduce the absence of communication in dire situations and incredibly pressured times throughout MOASS, I am presenting the idea of **duplicating and transitioning** r-forward slash-superstonk to gm-dot-xyz, the \*first crypto-native, decentralized, and user-owned social network. The site's immediate goal is to ""make creating and managing a DAO or crypto-asset community as easy as spinning up a subreddit.""

\*gm-dot-xyz does not currently hold this title, though this is the long-term mission. Please visit gm-dot-xyz/about and gm-dot-xyz/faq for more information because I don't want to make this too long.

As GameStop's wallet has been introduced and with the marketplace launching any day now, we'll begin to see more activity among dApps and more integration(s) within our wallets. Now that members of this community are introduced to the Web3 landscape, why not utilize the current Web3 form of Reddit?

&#x200B;

**TIN-FOIL:**

I've seen the majority of the ""gm"" or what seem to be ""good morning"" tweets from our community members, so I decided to research Blockchain/Web3 related content with gm as an acronym or name. I found the Web3-Reddit alternative.

https://preview.redd.it/samdhndzqg191.jpg?width=748&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d48adbfddf89ca25261ce2e61d31df3fe0379a34

https://preview.redd.it/2rkf64mzqg191.jpg?width=748&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=642e7ad1a7b827371cbac4163d76eb0976d78cab

I truly don't think that the ""gm"" tweets we've seen from major players in our Web3 network could be referencing gm-dot-xyz, but you never know.

&#x200B;

**MY EXPERIENCE:**

I created my GameStop wallet and went perusing around gm-dot-xyz to see what functionality the site offers.

https://preview.redd.it/6bz0ybj0rg191.jpg?width=2533&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=2b8c0c0e31c00bedb81ca1fb5646f3c23fb25437

1. Connecting my wallet to the site is incredibly easy. Just approve a few messages within your GameStop wallet extension and you're logged in.
2. The GameStop wallet and gm-dot-xyz recognized that I have registered an L1 (Layer 1, Ethereum blockchain) ENS (Ethereum Naming Service) and that it is in use as a username to my wallet ID. gm-dot-xyz allows you to use your hexadecimal wallet ID, your L1 ENS, or a custom username on the site.
3. NFTs that are currently tied to your L1 wallet address can be utilized on gm-dot-xyz and are automatically displayed privately in your profile settings upon signing in.
4. Idk what else there is to do on gm-dot-xyz because I don't have any communities that I'm apart of. From exploring the site, it looks like a merge between Reddit and Twitter.

BONUS! Bots will likely be less of an issue, or not an issue at all, as each user's account must have .01 ETH (I think that's the correct amount) to be active on the dApp. Spending money on Web3 bots will be costly over time. Additionally, a suspected bot's wallet ID and their transactions are publicly available, allowing users to investigate the integrity of the wallet, the holder, and the transactions.

**MIGRATION:**

Now, I'm not going to claim that this is the best idea going forward, but it is something that **must** be discussed among the community - if not, free and fair communication among the community may be threatened.

Mods, Apes - This is the form that creates communities on 'gm.'

Basic info, basic answers, click submit and \~voila\~, the first mass-migration of retards and deplorables into the Web3 space has begun. I have not personally created a GM Community, and I don't plan to. That's for **all** **of us** to agree upon. The main factor to consider changing would be the name of the community. Mods, creating a few polls on if the community name should be changed, and what that community name would be, would be helpful if this post gains traction.

https://preview.redd.it/rt1edpg1rg191.jpg?width=532&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e3c8b23e10b735cab59a456ce91fb42f494ca43c

I would love to have some of the Mods interact with this idea and drive the coordination efforts to transition this space into the realm of Web3. If the community is open to the idea of creating a Web3 version of r-forward slash-superstonk, let's communicate with the mods to establish a best-way-forward.

&#x200B;

Please, ask as many questions as you can - poke as many holes in this idea as you can - be innovative and find better solutions if this is not the best-way-forward. As many of us have supported Dave Lauer and Urvin Finance in the efforts to fight for free and fair markets, community members should be cognoscente of their position to fight for free and fair, and **decentralized** forums. Especially in the coming weeks as the thrusters prepare for ignition.

&#x200B;

None of this is advice, at all. Not financial, not social, not Web3 advice, nada. Each person reading this is an individual investor, player, creator, and collector - make your own decisions within and about the community.

Rocket Pool Smartnode Update v1.4,"Posted by u/jcrtp in the #releases channel of the [Rocket Pool Discord](https://discord.gg/Y3D72mjRqK):

Well, we *were* going to release v1.3.2... but we added so many features to it, we decided to launch it as **v1.4.0** instead!

This is a **medium priority update** for all users due to some security fixes in the clients.

It adds support for new Execution clients: **Nethermind** and **Besu**! If you would like to bolster the health and diversity of the Execution layer (ETH1), you can now use these instead of Geth.

Please read our the Client Migration Guide ([https://docs.rocketpool.net/guides/node/change-clients.html](https://docs.rocketpool.net/guides/node/change-clients.html)) for instructions on how to switch clients.

📷 **NOTE: Light clients (Infura and Pocket) are now DEPRECATED because the upcoming Ethereum Merge is NOT COMPATIBLE with them. You will be required to run a full Execution client after the merge, and the light clients will be removed in a future version of the Smartnode accordingly.**

For the full patch notes, please visit [https://github.com/rocket-pool/smartnode-install/releases/tag/v1.4.0](https://github.com/rocket-pool/smartnode-install/releases/tag/v1.4.0) but there is a summary of key changes below:

\---

**Key Changes**

* **The fallback EC will now take over if your primary EC is still syncing.**
* **Added Nethermind and Besu** to the list of Execution clients.
   * 📷 *These clients are not optimized for ARM nodes (such as the Raspberry Pi* *📷*\*) yet. If you use an ARM device, we recommend waiting for a future release to try them.\*
* **Deprecated Infura and Pocket**, as they will **no longer be usable after The Merge**.
* Added support for exporting your node's stats to the **Beaconcha.in monitor**, so you can track your performance via their mobile app! You'll find it in the `Metrics` section of the `service config` TUI.
   * Thanks to \[Discord member\] donttakemetooseriously for adding this!
   * Currently, only Lighthouse and Teku are supported.
* New commands:
   * `rocketpool service export-eth1-data <folder>` lets you export your EC chain data to e.g. an external hard drive, so you can back it up if you change clients but want to keep the old data just in case.
   * `rocketpool service import-eth1-data <folder>` lets you restore backed up chain data in case you want to revert to your old client, so you don't need to resync the entire chain again.
* `rocketpool wallet recover` and `rocketpool wallet test-mnemonic` now ask for your words one at a time, and let you know if you made a typo. This makes them much more user-friendly and dissuades people from copying and pasting their entire phrase, which is dangerous.
   * Thanks to \[Discord member\] 0xPatches.eth for all of the hard work on this!
* The **graffiti prefix** now shows both your Execution and Consensus client choices (e.g. `RP-BN v1.4.0` is for Besu and Nimbus).

\---

*To upgrade and keep the same network that you have now (either Prater or Mainnet), follow the Smartnode upgrade instructions (*[*https://docs.rocketpool.net/guides/node/updates.html#updating-the-smartnode-stack*](https://docs.rocketpool.net/guides/node/updates.html#updating-the-smartnode-stack)*).*",30.0,2022-05-24 16:27:33,0.98

**Frequently Asked Questions**

**Where's the best place to buy ETH?**

There are many centralized exchanges that support Ethereum. If you live in the US, the most popular exchanges are Coinbase, Gemeni and Kraken. Coinbase users can use Coinbase Pro for lower fees.

**When is Eth2 launching?**

Eth2 is a marketing term used to represent a number of updates to Ethereum. The Eth2 proof-of-stake chain first launched in December 2020. ""The Merge"", which is the event that will fully switch Ethereum's consensus to proof-of-stake, is estimated to be ready in early 2022, although there is no exact timeline. Other updates, such as data shards, will follow that update.

Visit [ethmerge.com](https://ethmerge.com/) to learn more about ""The Merge"".

**Do I need to do anything to update to Eth2? Will Eth2 create a new token?**

No, ETH holders *never* need to take any action to keep holding ETH. Ethereum users will be unaffected by the Eth2 upgrade. And the Eth2 updates will not create any new tokens.

**How can I stake my ETH?**

The best way to stake your ETH: by running your own validator.

* Running your own validator requires a modern computer and 32 ETH. Visit /r/ethstaker for more details

**Why are Ethereum transaction fees so high?**

Like most blockchains, Ethereum fees are determined by supply-and-demand. The large demand to use Ethereum has pushed transaction fees quite high (however, fees were just a few cents only 2 years ago). Fees are especially high during market volatility, and during NFT drops.

**What is being done to lower Ethereum transaction fees?**

Ethereum fees are reduced by using layer-2 rollups. Rollups are scaling solutions that allow for significantly cheaper transactions, while still maintaining Ethereum's security.

Additionally, Eth2's data shards will make rollups even cheaper.

While rollups are cutting-edge technology being actively developed, a number are already live on Ethereum mainnet. Visit [l2beat.com](https://l2beat.com/) to learn more about rollups.

**What's the best wallet for Ethereum?**

The most popular tool for using decentralized applications is Metamask. However, for security reasons, we recommend using a hardware wallet such as a Trezor or Ledger.

"Ethereum Has Destroyed $8.10 Billion in Ether, ETH Scarcity to Increase After The Merge. Would the Prices of Ether Increase Exponentially After the Merge due to It's Increase Scarcity?","Ethereum engineers implemented EIP 1559, a ruleset upgrade that essentially modified the algorithm tied to the protocol's base fee per gas, and the network now burns the base fee per gas.
2.35 million ether worth $8.10 billion in USD has been destroyed forever after the August 5, 2021 London update, after EIP 1559 was codified into the codebase and made live.

Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin said the update was ""probably the most essential component of [the] London [upgrade]"" the day after it was implemented.
The network experienced its highest daily burn rate ever on May 1, 2022, with 71,718 ether worth $138.78 million. 
While EIP 1559 was a significant protocol change in the London upgrade, The Merge will be the next major update. Ethereum will then switch from its present proof-of-work (PoW) consensus mechanism to a full proof-of-stake (PoS) network.
Proponents of Ethereum are already preparing for The Merge, believing that the shift will be formalised this summer. Consensys, an Ethereum-focused software business, just announced an early access version of ""Bonsai Tries"" on May 17, aiming to be a few steps ahead of the formal Merge transfer.

Well I think everyone is aware of the basic the concept that decline in supply would cause an increase in demand which would drive up price. The reduction of   Ether's yearly supply by the proposed upgrade seems likely to cause a significant increase it's price and also make it a great of store of value. The coming merge would also increase the network scalability enabling it to process transactions way faster. I think increase in the effectiveness of the network and an increased scarcity of the platform's native token would cause ETH prices to rise significantly. 
The various proposed update will without a doubt increase the effectiveness of various innovative projects running on Ethereum network such as 
Bancor is a tokens deployed on the Ethereum blockchain which allows users to create new cryptocurrencies, Shiryo is a P2E Card trading game in the metaverse that allows users to hold their cards as NFTs also based on the Ethereum network, SUSHI is a decentralized exchange which aims to be the one-top-shop for decentralized financial services,   These “smart tokens” can hold or trade against reserve tokens. 
It would be interesting to see how it all plays out after the update. The merge is complex and hard to effectively implement but not impossible to. An in increase the value of ETH would attract both retail and institutional investors and would cause an increase in investment

Binance Integrates Ethereum Layer 2 Network Optimism,"Binance now supports deposits to the Ethereum Layer 2 network Optimism

Binance is bullish on Ethereum's Layer 2's future. 

On Friday, the leading cryptocurrency exchange and the trading place of cryptocurrencies like Tea that financially rewards open source developers, Bitcoin and Gitcoin that perform the same functions; announced the addition of Optimism to its November 2021 Arbitrum integration. Customers can now deposit ETH directly to Optimism without first depositing on Ethereum mainnet and then using a bridge to migrate to Layer 2. As a result, they will be able to move their assets and gain access to the Ethereum network at a lower cost. 
Optimism is one of several Layer 2 projects assisting Ethereum in achieving scalability.

It makes use of Optimistic Rollups, a technology that reduces Ethereum traffic by processing transactions on a new network and then sending them as calldata to the Ethereum mainnet. Optimistic Rollups outperform Ethereum in terms of speed and transaction costs, but they do have long mainnet withdrawal periods of up to a week. 

Currently, Optimism and Arbitrum are Ethereum's two leading Optimistic Rollup solutions, hosting Aave and other top DeFi projects. Arbitrum currently has a $2.76 billion total value lock on the Layer 2 race, compared to Optimism's $500 million. Optimism was in the spotlight last month when it announced the launch of its OP token, and rumors suggest that Arbitrum may follow suit with its own token in the near future.

Aside from Optimistic Rollups, ZK-Rollups is another promising Layer 2 technology that Ethereum is betting on to become more user-friendly. ZK-Rollup solutions offer a way to bundle many transactions together and commit them to Ethereum's Layer One as a single proof by leveraging a cryptographic technology known as zero-knowledge proofs. zkSync and StarkWare are two projects that work in the ZK-Rollups domain. 

While Ethereum's Layer 2 space is gaining traction, Ethereum itself has a busy few months ahead of it. The top smart contract network is expected to release its long-awaited ""Merge"" to Proof-of-Stake this year. 

The upgrade's release date is still unknown, but recent hints from the Ethereum Foundation suggest that it could happen as soon as August. Ethereum has already finished several dedicated Merge testnets and plans to release the update on the Ropsten testnet around June 8.",21.0,2022-05-22 10:04:03,0.87
Vitalik Buterin Confirms Ethereum’s Merge Could Happen in August. Would the impending Merge re assert Ethereum's Dominance and also cause a Surge in the Price of Ether,"The most anticipated event in Ethereum's 7-year existence, according to the project's co-founder and a few of core ETH developers, might happen in the next months. This should happen before the network is slowed by the ""difficulty bomb.""

Preston Van Loon, an ETH core engineer, said at a discussion at the Permissionless conference that The Merge might happen in August:
""As far as we know, August – it just makes sense if everything goes according to plan."" Let's do it as fast as we can if we don't have to move (the difficulty bomb).""

The difficulty bomb is a built-in feature of Ethereum's programming that will eventually slow the network down. It was included by the development team for two reasons: to motivate developers to strive for the proof of stake transition and to make it more difficult for miners to stay on the proof of work chain after the event.
Although the difficulty bomb has been postponed in the past to ensure that the network functions properly, the team hopes to avoid another delay this time and finish The Merge before the blockchain slows down.
Another developer, Tim Beiko, already stated that The Merge will not take place in June as planned, but rather a few months later.
The Ropsten public testnet was announced to complete The Merge in early June, marking a major milestone on the Ethereum blockchain's path to PoS.

I think that everyone would agree that the proposed upgrade of the Ethereum network is much needed as the upgrade would potentially solve the platform's scalability issue, reduce the energy required to run the network and also reducing the cost of operating the network. Also the switch to a Proofs-of-stake consensus would see the platform reward for participating in the running network get a  90% which reduces supply and increases demand which could cause a significant surge in the price of ETH.

I think considering the blockchain ecosystem which is growing exponentially and with an increase in innovative projects catering to diverse needs and proffering diverse solutions in the ecosystem that could revolutionize how business, the Internet, entertainment and even society in general operates  such as Luckyblock which  is a digital asset project that decentralizies the lottery process via blockchain technology,Tea an open-source software platform revolutionizing open‐source by leveraging blockchain and web3. Tea is developing a first-of-its-kind decentralized system for fairly remunerating open-source developers based on their contributions to the entire ecosystem, Decentraland  an online world that allows users to create their own avatars and purchase plots of virtual land,  Silks a blockchain-based metaverse that enables users to own, trade, and profit from thoroughbred racing horses. 
Blockchain technology is on par to becoming mainstem and would potentially change how business  and society in general operates. 
This makes upgrade of the Ethereum network a very welcome initiative as blockchain becomes mainstream the network would be able to handle the flood of transactions that comes with mainstream adoption of blockchain technology. 
If the Ethereum network becomes scalable and gas fees are relatively low with the network and projects running of the blockchain operating effectively. 
I don't think that anyone other network would be able take away Ethereum's dominance and with Ethereum's continued dominance the price of ETH gain exponential value overtime.

A beginners Guide to Cryptocurrency," **What is a blockchain?**

It is an “immutable ledger.” Think about it like a book that lives in the sky. Every time something changes, its written down with magic ink, that when dries, never changes. And there are thousands of copies of these books, all getting updated at the same time. If one is ever messed with, the other books would wipe out the problem and replace it with the correct entry.

**What is proof of Work?**

First generation crypto currency worked of the concept of Poof of work. There, it is a race to solve a complicated math puzzle, and perform the block write operation. And as a reward get coin. “Mining.” Mining is slow. Bitcoin can only do 7 transactions a minute.

Of the thousands and thousands of machines out there racing to win the next block, only 1 at a time wins. That means the others have literally wasted their energy via compute CPU and GPU cycles. Bitcoin used more energy than Argentina last year.  
But its not all bad. POW is still the oldest and most battle tested consensus algorithm, and many ague more secure because of it.

[https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-56012952](https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-56012952)

**What is proof of Stake?**

Proof of Stake works on different types of newly developed “Consensus” algorithms. Ouroboros protocol, created by IHOK and Cardano, along with a team of PHDs and mathematicians, is the first of its kind. They created a secure “lottery” consensus mechanism to “elect” the next “slot leader” to write the block. Here each Stake pool can get a chance to be elected by winning the lottery. Each Ada coin represents 1 lottery ticket. When you delegate to the pool, you give that pool your ticket, not your coin. If the pool wins, you get the reward along with everyone in the pool, and the operator. Because there is no more complicated math puzzle, and no more computers racing to solve the puzzle, its much much faster, and much much cheaper. Cardano nodes can be run on Raspberry Pi.. A lot of nodes out there run on Solar energy. It’s so good, Ethereum, who is proof of work currently, is moving to this model as part of their ETH 2.0 migration. Hopefully this summer with the ""merge."" In efforts to reduce gas fees and energy concerns. Pokodot created its own Consensus algorithm. Called Grandpa. Tezos has its Emmy+, and the list goes on.

Each other their own way of doing things. But “gen 3” is not Proof of work.

What you should remember is that for both POW, POS, and others, they are all a means of incentivizing the actual people that run the computers hosting the blockchain code. Without them, there is no “decentralized network of immutable ledgers.” Which is because that’s just fancy talk for machines running our code to support the blockchain.

**What is Market Cap and coin supply and why should we care?**

Market Capitalization is equal to Price of Coin times Supply of Coin. That is, it. But very important.

BITCOIN has a fixed supply. It is not all mined yet. Not until 2140. But it does have a finite amount, 21 Million.

Here is why you can see a 65K or even 100K bitcoin, but you’ll probably never see a 100 dollar DOGE, or even a 30 Dollar Ada (not soon anyway)

Currently there are 19,045,000 BTC out there at a cost of 28,873.01.

That means, the market cap is 28,873.01 x 19,045,000 = 549,886,475,450 (549B)

Cardano, has a fixed coin supply as well. But it is 45 Billion. There are currently 33,739,028,516. So you see the max is 2500x more. Likewise, with 130B DOGE vs 18M BTC - it’s \~6700X more. DogeCoin also makes 10,000 new coins a minute.

At a price is .50 that means the market cap for Cardano is .5 X 33,739,028,516 =16,869,514,258 (16B)

You'll need a 1 Trillion Market Cap for Cardano to hit 30  
33,739,028,516 \* 30 = 1012170855480

To give you some reference. Here is the Market cap of some big names.

Visa – 499B

Adobe – 250B

Amazon – 1.7T

It’s very confusing because every coin has their own supply. Their own way of creating coins and at what cadence. Some even “burn” coins. So, know what yours does and how it works.

**How can I “get in early?”**

First. We are all early. You might not have gotten in on the first floor, but we’re only halfway up the stairs to the second flight.

Global wealth is estimated at 1 quadrillion. All the Market Cap in crypto is at 1.23 Trillion. That’s only 0.11% of the world’s wealth.

When looking for “what could be the next big thing” find something with a low market cap, regardless of coin price, that has a strong chance of doing well because of team and tech, the two Ts.

Also ask yourself.

What are these coins use cases?

Who is their target audience for adoption?

Who is funding them?

Who is their team building it? What is their history?

Do they have a good plan?

[https://river.com/learn/how-much-worlds-money-in-bitcoin/#:\~:text=Global%20wealth%20is%20estimated%20at,represents%200.09%25%20of%20global%20wealth](https://river.com/learn/how-much-worlds-money-in-bitcoin/#:~:text=Global%20wealth%20is%20estimated%20at,represents%200.09%25%20of%20global%20wealth).

**What are your goals?**

Crypto is really split into 4 worlds.

Day traders, H.O.D.L.’ers, Whales, and weak hands.

Day traders realize that this market is very volatile, now, and historically. Good ones, can capitalize on quick gains by buying low and selling high, waiting for a dip, then buying back in, and selling high again, cyclically.

Then there are those that “Hold On for Dear Life.” These people tend to find something they really are passionate about, and never sell. They keep buying. If they see their coin dips, below at what they bought it at, and have some extra funds, they buy more, to ""Average Down."" Or Dollar cost average (DCA) by buying a set amount on a regular cadence. They only “take profit” buy selling a small portion when price is really high.

Whales, are investors that come in with millions and billions of dollars. They often “test” the market buy either buying or dumping millions and billions in hopes to manipulate the market to their advantage. If you’re reading this, you’re probably not in this category, but you should know they exist and effect this marketplace.

Then there are “weak hands.” Do not pick this one. These people buy high and sell low. They only invest based on emotion, and nothing else. When things start going bad, they panic, and sell at a loss. Its much better to let your coin go to .000000001 cents, and just hold on to it in the hopes of a rally years later, then it is to ever sell at a loss. Never do this. Never.   
Take Luna for example. You probably lost your investment. Period. But, you never know.   
Look at Ripple. Look at Shib.   
Both were thought to be dead, but they live. 

Each has its own risks and rewards.

Day trading can rack up dollars quick, but you can lose them just as quick. And there are tax implicates with trades. Some unknown, and constantly changing.

HODL, might take years, but if you do, the chance of your Return on Invest improves significantly in crypto.

Pick what works best for you but have a plan.

**What are things to look out for?**

**Do your own research**. There are now more then 4K types of crypto currencies. You can create your own in about 30 minutes with the right free tools.

The mortality rate of new coins is super high this year. Lots of people trying to do Pump and Dumps.

There is nothing in life that goes up for no reason, if it does, it’s a Ponzi scheme.

**What is the difference between storing on an exchange or in a wallet?**

A lot.

First, you must remember what the dream of crypto is really offering.

Its offering a way for us to break away from banks. Forever.

Centralized banks that can print money, is a problem. Blockchain solves this.

But not if the new bank ends up being Binace or Coinbase. In fact, keeping your coin in exchanges puts us all at risk of market manipulation by them.

When a certain 1 person or group owns too many nodes, they can make choices that would benefit them. The attack vector is called a 51% attack or sybil attack.

Today however, you need exchanges to on ramp and off ramp FIAT. FIAT money is government-issued currency that is not backed by a physical commodity, such as gold or silver.

But it will not be like that forever. Chains like ADA and DOT will be interoperable with legacy banks and will eventually cut out exchanges.

Personally, I despise BNB coin and binace. They already take high fees, and now they want the control and the rewards too. Coinbase isn’t much better. Again though, a necessary evil, for now.

But more important than the “dream” is that they can be hacked.

They are a website. Not a blockchain. They hold the keys to your wallet, and let you use them with a weak password and no mfa if you like. Its literally like storing your money in a bank. So know your bank. Good thing, like a bank, SOME, are federally insured up to a certain amount. But some are not, and people have lost millions and billions in the past this way.

Lastly, there is the notification of “passive income” and “interest.”

With POS systems, delegators are incentivized to “stake” their coin by earning interest.

With POW systems, like bitcoin, you’d have to stand up your own machine, configure it, and let it use your energy in your house. With withs like Cardano Ada, and ETH 2.0, you can now pull your coin off the exchange, put it in a wallet, delegate to a pool, and earn interest. All while maintaining full control of your coins.

**What are Smart Contracts? (This one will blow your mind if you are a developer)**

First let us start with what most people say.

“Smart contracts are self-executing contracts with the terms of the agreement between buyer and seller being directly written into lines of code.”

Which is true for sure. It helps build trust and removes the cumbersome third party “trusted agent” like a bank.

But what smart contracts really are is “ANY Code” that can be written to a blockchain and NEVER be changed, forever.

ANY CODE. You can write your own coins and put them into the block. It happens a lot.

Games, sure, put in the chain. Check out CryptoKitties.

In the future ALL business will be blockchain businesses. Every transaction, every process in the building and distribution, will be written to a magic book that can’t be messed with.. Ever..

**What are NFTs?**

NonFungible Tokens is metadata attached to an asset.

The metadata is things like who created it, and when. Along with the most important piece the link to the asset.

The asset is what most people think of when they talk about NFTs.  
Its a digital file. Like a jpg or a mov file.  
But its not stored in the blockchain like most assume.  
Instead they are stored, most often, in IPFS storage.  
IPFS is very cool, but its not blockchain, and thus not ""immutable.""

So what’s the big deal? I can upload a gif to the internet today.

The big deal is twofold.

First, you are not uploading anything to the “internet.” That whole thing we call the internet is flawed. Tracked, centralized, monitored, and gated.

What you are doing is creating an EARLY entry, in a book that will never change for the rest of time.

Let us sit and think about that for a second.

De Beers is going to have to get new slogan. “A ~~diamond~~ NFT is forever”

Right now, it is some awful GIF of a dogecoin. But it is not what it is. It is what it represents.

It is the next chapter in Art history. What is created will last longer than the Mona Lisa. Someday you will have blockchain archaeologist that comb though chains.

Plus, taking away the cool factor, they create a place that you can now prove you did it first.

Artist could upload lyrics as an NFT, and later sell them, without the fear their art might be stolen before a contract is in place. People could attach their house deed to a chain, and ever again dispute who owns the land after a conflict.

Besides gaming, NFTs are frequently used to sell a wide range of virtual collectibles, including NBA virtual trading cards, music, digital images, video clips and even virtual real estate in [Decentraland](https://decentraland.org/), a virtual world.

That of course is the rosier outlook on NFTs.

Unfortunately, in practice there are many gaps today.

The first I already mentioned. The asset is not stored in the blockchain.  
What that means is that the IPFS provider could ""unpin"" your asset, and if its not saved anywhere else, you'll end up with an NFT that has metadata that points to a url that has nothing there.

The second problem, is that there are thousands of blockchains. People can take your asset, because its publicly pined, and then go create an NFT on another blockchain, and then claim theirs is in fact the original. You'd have to check every chain that supports NFTs to ensure it was in fact the first first.

Or people have taken hard artwork, like paintings, and then minted and sold them as NFTs.

Ethereum on Track for Testnet Merge in June. Will the proposed Switch to a Proof of Stake Consesus really make the Ethereum Network more Effective!,"An Ethereum DevOps developer contributed a pull request for the Ropsten testnet Merge configuration code to the GitHub repository earlier this week. The Ropsten testnet was built nearly five years ago by the Ethereum Foundation and is regarded one of the best clones of the Ethereum blockchain.
The merging will essentially integrate the two layers in a single PoS-based chain, signaling the end of the PoW-style design. According to Terence Tsao of Prysmatic Labs, the Ropsten testnet Merge will begin on May 30.

Lead developer Tim Beiko previously stated that the mainnet integration will most likely take place a few months after June and not sooner.

However, as the network completes its transition, the Ropsten merge will demonstrate the genuine merge between Ethereum and the Beacon Chain. Preston Van Loon, an Ethereum core engineer, has stated that this event marks a significant testing milestone on the way to ETH's mainnet merging later this year.

As the merging approaches, the developers have started running tests in new infrastructures to investigate network mechanics and client readiness.

For example, in April, the ""Shadow fork"" became online, allowing Ethereum Foundation developer Parithosh Jayanthi to ""stress test our assumptions about syncing and state growth."" Using the devnets, developers can identify serious flaws in their code that might otherwise go unreported.


I think that with  the scalability issues on the current  Ethereum network which makes processing transactions on the platform a hassle especially  when the network is congested and causes significants hike in gas fees which the proof-of-stake consensus which makes the switch a much welcome initiativea. Also the change to a Proof-of-stake consensus would drastically reduce the amount of energy required to run the network which would make running the Ethereum platform more sustainable. Then the number of Ether issued has incentive for participating in keeping the Blockchain Platform running would drastically reduce which would  increase the value of Ether over time has it would reduce supply which in turn would increase demand.  I think these amongst other issues makes proof of stake consensus an important update. 

The Ethereum network is the go to platform for projects development and for forway web3 and the blockchain as a whole, the network is littered with diverse innovative projects such as SUSHI is a decentralized exchange which aims to be the one-top-shop for decentralized financial services,  Bancor is a tokens deployed on the Ethereum blockchain which allows users to create new cryptocurrencies. These “smart tokens” can hold or trade against reserve tokens, Shiryo is a P2E Card trading game in the metaverse that allows users to hold their cards as NFTs also based on the Ethereum network, Aave primarily a lending platform, letting users earn interest on their cryptocurrency through collateralized loans, Brave web browser that it gives its users the option to view ads or not , if users choose to view them, they will be rewarded with Basic Attention Tokens (BAT). 
I think  that coming update would help make projects on the platform more effectively run and  transactions easier. However the magnitude of update is complex and hard to implement. It would be interesting to see how it is carried out.

"Vitalik at Eth Shanghai May 20 on the Merge: ""If there are NO problems then then August... always a risk of delays. September is possible. October is possible as well.""","Vitalik at Eth Shanghai Today. Not exact quote just a quick paraphrase:

>The biggest news in Ethereum is the merge... we have been working on proof of stake for almost 7 years now. The biggest announcements that happened this week is the week is the TestNet merge. This will be a major test. Bigger than any we have done before.  
>  
>If everything goes well, Justin says the plan is for August. ***If there are NO problems*** **then the merge will happen in August.** But of course there is always a risk of problems. There is always a risk of delays. September is possible. October is possible as well. But the merge is at coming.

I can't seem to link to a time in a YouTube livestream because the video is still recording, and it counts time backwards from the end, but Vitalik is the second face you see on screen, towards the beginning.

The way he kind of emphasizes *If there are NO problems...* really sounds like he thinks it's probably not the most likely scenario.

I would also note that at the ETH dev call, a lot of people seemed pretty concerned that upgraded Eth nodes didn't recognize non-upgraded ETH nodes running the wrong version, and that upgrading this time was more involved than normal, so it was more likely than in the past that this upgrade would happen in a environment with a lot of non-upgraded nodes. They really seemed to expect to have to patch in something to handle this case, which at the very least would knock them back to the first TestNet again.

TLDR: Sept or Oct seem likely.",81.0,2022-05-20 10:04:00,0.97
Huge testing milestone for Ethereum: Ropsten testnet Merge set for June 8,"Merging Ropsten is a huge testing milestone towards Ethereum’s mainnet merge later this year,” said Preston Van Loon, an Ethereum core developer at Prysmatic Labs.

The Ethereum ecosystem is set for a “huge testing milestone” with the Ropsten testnet Merge set to be conducted on June 8.

According to the Merge testnets page on Github, Ethereum DevOps engineer Parathi Jayanathi submitted a pull request for the Ropsten testnet Merge configuration code on Monday, suggesting the implementation is ready to go.

Ropsten is one of several testnets created by the Ethereum Foundation in 2017 and which is currently maintained by the Geth developer team.

This specific testnet is seen as the best replication of the Ethereum Mainnet as it follows a similar network structure. This enables devs to conduct realistic deployment testing before making updates to the actual mainnet.

The Ropsten testnet Merge will see the proof-of-work network combined with a new proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus layer testnet, with its genesis set for May 30. It will simulate what will happen once the actual Merge between Ethereum and the Beacon Chain finally takes place and it becomes a PoS network.

Devs in the community have been posting their bullishness about the testnet news online. Preston Van Loon, an Ethereum core developer at Prysmatic Labs said that..

Crypto : ma thèse d'investissement pour l'Ethereum,"Après quelques années à gosser avec les actions et les options, j'ai passé les 18 derniers mois à plonger corps et âme dans l'univers de la crypto. Je suis quelqu'un d'un peu obsessif, et disons que j'ai trouvé un challenge à la hauteur de mes manies avec un sujet aussi complexe. 

 J'écris cette publication aujourd'hui afin d'expliquer à ceux et celle que ça intéresse pourquoi j'ai décidé de miser gros sur l'Ethereum. Je ne cherche pas à convaincre quiconque; cet exercice me permet d'articuler ma thèse plus clairement, mais je vous encourage vivement à penser par vous-même et à tirer vos propres conclusions.

**Qu'est-ce que l'ether?** 

L'ether (ETH) est la monnaie native de la blockchain Ethereum. Elle sert à payer les frais de transactions du réseau. Ces frais varient selon l'utilisation du réseau, un peu comme le prix de l'essence qui varie selon l'offre et la demande. Par exemple, si je veux transférer 1000$ d'un compte Ethereum à un autre, il m'en coûtera aujourd'hui environ 0**.**0011 ETH, soit 1,50$USD. 

Ces frais de transaction sont actuellement versés aux mineurs qui valident les blocs selon le concept « proof-of-work ». En gros, le premier ordinateur qui trouve la réponse à une équation mathématique gagne le droit de « miner » le prochain bloc, et il reçoit les frais de transaction dans son compte en échange de son travail. 

L'ether a donc une utilité : payer les frais de transaction sur la blockchain Ethereum. 

**À quoi sert la blockchain Ethereum?** 

Ethereum vend un produit : l'espace dans ses blocs. Comme on l'a vu plus haut, ce produit a une valeur qui fluctue selon l'offre et la demande. Plus il y a d'activités sur le réseau à un moment précis, plus l'espace des blocs coûtera cher.   

Par exemple, il y a quelques semaines, le prix pour une simple transaction a dépassé les 2 ETH (6000$USD selon le cours à ce moment) pendant trois heures, parce qu'une grosse collection de NFT venait d'être lancée et que tout le monde voulait mettre la main dessus en même temps. Lorsque la vente a été terminée, moins de gens voulaient utiliser le réseau, et les prix sont redescendus à leur niveau moyen. 

Puisque le réseau Ethereum est 100% transparent, nous pouvons savoir en temps réel combien de revenus il génère en vendant cet espace dans ses blocs. Au moment où j'écris ces lignes, Ethereum [a généré 7,6 millions USD en revenus](https://cryptofees.info/) dans les 24h dernières heures. Ça fluctue beaucoup (lorsque la fameuse collection de NFT a été lancée le mois dernier, Ethereum a encaissé 230 millions USD en 24h). 

En 2021, le revenu total généré par Ethereum s'est élevé à 9,9 milliards USD. Il y a donc une demande pour le produit offert. 

**Où vont ces revenus?** 

Actuellement, 30% des revenus vont dans les poches des mineurs, et 70% des revenus sont « brûlés », c'est-à-dire qu'ils sont déduits du compte du payeur, mais sans être crédités ailleurs. On peut penser à ce « brûlage » d'ether comme à un programme de rachat d'actions par une entreprise; puisque cet ether disparaît de la circulation, cela crée un certain effet de rareté. 

Or, les mineurs doivent assumer de grosses dépenses. Miner de l'Ethereum en 2022, c'est une job pour les professionnels. Ça prend de gros locaux, des milliers d'ordinateurs qui calculent 24/7, de l'électricité en quantité industrielle, etc. Il est donc difficile de calculer la marge de profits enregistrés à partir de ces revenus; on sait néanmoins que les mineurs vendent une grosse partie de l'ether qu'ils reçoivent pour leur travail, puisqu'ils ont des coûts fixes à assumer. 

Mais tout cela va changer dans quelques mois, et c'est ici qu'on entre au cœur de la thèse d'investissement. 

**Le « merge » va tout changer** 

Le système « proof-of-work » (PoW) est hautement inefficace. Il est polluant, coûteux et très difficile à faire fonctionner sur une large échelle. Dans un système PoW, Ethereum ne peut pas gérer plus qu'une dizaine de transactions à la seconde avant que le prix des transactions n'explose. C'est vraiment pas génial pour un réseau qui aspire à l'ubiquité.

Mais voilà l'affaire que personne en dehors du monde de la crypto n'a encore réalisé : d'ici la fin de l'été, Ethereum abandonnera complètement le PoW pour passer au « proof-of-stake » (PoS) dans un processus surnommé « the merge ». 

C'est ce changement qui se trouve au cœur de ma thèse. 

Je n'entrerai pas dans les détails techniques, même s'ils sont fascinants, mais il suffit de savoir que la consommation énergétique du réseau sera diminuée de plus de 99%. Envoyer une transaction Ethereum après le passage au PoS ne demandera pas davantage d'énergie que l'envoi d'un courriel ou une recherche Google. C'est le premier avantage. 

Le deuxième, c'est que désormais, quiconque pourra « staker » son ether pour contribuer à la sécurité du réseau... et ces « stakers » remplaceront les mineurs dans la distribution des revenus. Ainsi, 30% des revenus du réseau seront distribués aux « stakers », en proportion de leur part du gâteau. 

Si Ethereum avait été en mode PoS l'an dernier, les « stakers » auraient reçu 30% de 9.9 milliards USD; disons qu'on arrondit à 3 milliards USD. Quelqu'un qui possède 1% de l'ether staké aurait donc reçu 300 000 USD. Et cela, sans n'avoir aucune dépense. Il suffit de déposer son ether dans un validateur, et le tour est joué (je simplifie le processus ici, dans la réalité c'est plus complexe, mais c'est suffisant pour comprendre où je veux en venir). Le validateur n'a besoin que d'une connection internet ordinaire et d'une prise électrique. Et il y a déjà plein de services qui existent pour ceux qui veulent staker sans avoir à gérer un validateur. 

Un troisième avantage, c'est que le passage au PoS pave la voie au « sharding ». C'est un peu technique ça aussi, mais l'important, c'est de retenir que le sharding permettra éventuellement à Ethereum de traiter des dizaines de milliers de transactions par seconde, à un prix minime (l'objectif est d'arriver en bas de 5 sous par transaction). 

**Dividendes et émissions** 

L'ether qui est « staké » va donc recevoir un « dividende » représentant 30% des revenus du réseau, et l'autre 70% des revenus sera brûlé. Mais ce n'est pas tout : ceux et celles qui « stakent » vont également recevoir les nouvelles émissions d'ether. Le réseau est configuré pour trouver un équilibre autour de 100 millions d'ether au total; si le nombre total d'ether en circulation monte, le taux d'émission va diminuer, et vice-versa. 

Si on se base sur les chiffres de 2021, on peut s'attendre à ce que le rendement de l'ether staké après le passage au PoS sera entre 7% et 15% (certains arrivent même à 20%, mais je préfère être relativement conservateur). Un rendement obtenu pratiquement sans dépenses, faut-il le rappeler. 

Disons qu'on coupe la poire en deux et qu'on établit le rendement moyen à 10%. Si tu stakes 1 ether, tu auras 1.1 ether dans un an, 1.21 dans deux ans, etc. Il y a donc un incitatif assez clair à staker son ether. Or, l'ether staké ne peut pas être utilisé pour payer ses transactions sur le réseau. Cela mènera vers une réduction massive de l'ether disponible sur le marché secondaire – pourquoi le vendre quand tu peux obtenir 10% de rendement sans efforts? 

Simultanément, les mineurs seront complètement éliminés, et donc, ils ne vendront plus d'ether pour couvrir leurs frais d'opération. Les estimations varient, mais le consensus veut qu'environ 30 millions USD d'ether est vendu sur le marché chaque jour par les mineurs. Cette pression de vente disparaîtra du jour au lendemain lorsque le réseau passera au PoS. 

**Ok... Mais à quoi ça sert, le réseau Ethereum?** 

C'est le point le plus énigmatique de la thèse pour la plupart des gens. C'est bien beau tout ça, mais pourquoi les gens achètent-ils de l'espace dans les blocs de ce réseau? 

Dit simplement, la réponse est la suivante : Ethereum est en train de créer sa propre économie. 

Vous n'allez jamais acheter votre café avec de l'ether ou du Bitcoin. Et c'est bien correct comme ça. 

Je trace un parrallèle avec internet. Aux tout débuts d'internet, bien des gens étaient sceptiques. Pourquoi je m'achèterais un modem et que je gosserais pendant des heures sur mon ordi juste pour écouter une partie de baseball sur une « webradio », alors que j'ai déjà une radio à la maison? Fast forward 25 ans plus tard : qui écoute encore des parties de baseball à la radio? Le web a créé un nouvel écosystème qui aurait été impossible à créer avec la radio traditionnelle, et les gens s'y sont rués. 

Le même phénomène est en train de se produire sous nos yeux avec Ethereum. Je ne vais pas utiliser mon ether pour payer mon café; je vais utiliser mon ether dans ce nouvel écosystème, cette nouvelle économie qui serait impossible dans le système traditionnel. 

L'un des premiers usages que le marché a adopté est les NFTs. Je sais, je sais, vous haïssez les NFTs. Mais c'est parce que 1) les gens qui transigent des NFTs sont souvent insupportables et donnent une très mauvaise image de l'industrie, et 2) les NFTs sont actuellement associés à des fraudes et des dessins de singes hors de prix. 

Or, ce serait une erreur que de croire que les NFTs ne sont qu'une mode. Je suis persuadé que le monde sera de plus en plus numérique, et qu'ainsi, nous aurons besoin d'une façon de certifier la propriété des actifs numériques. Les NFTs sont à l'étape « Napster » de leur développement, et ce n'est qu'une question de temps avant qu'ils n'évoluent jusqu'à leur étape « Spotify ». Vous allez fort probablement utiliser des NFTs dans votre vie, et probablement que vous ne le saurez même pas (au même titre qu'aujourd'hui, vous utilisez des protocoles internet sans savoir comment ils fonctionnent). 

Les autres utilisations possibles sont sans limite. Un réseau social qui appartient entièrement à sa communauté. Des artistes qui vendent leurs œuvres en se programmant des royautés perpétuelles sur chaque vente. Un log-in universel pour tous les sites web, sans mot de passe. La possibilité d'envoyer de l'argent à l'autre bout du monde en une seconde, pour une fraction de cenne. Il faut avoir navigué un peu sur le Web3 pour comprendre à quel point c'est un game-changer. Il y a aussi la DeFi (finance décentralisée), qui est actuellement un Far West dangereux, mais qui finira par devenir mainstream, à mon avis, tellement ses avantages seront indiscutables. 

On s'éloigne un peu de ma thèse, mais vous voyez où je veux en venir. S'il y a une leçon que je retiens des 25 dernières années, c'est la suivante : *ne misez jamais contre les nerds, ils finissent toujours par gagner*. Et en ce moment, les nerds sont tous en train de développer ce nouveau monde, et ils le développent sur Ethereum. 

**Pourquoi tout cela va faire monter le prix de l'ether?** 

En ce moment, l'ether se transige à environ 2000$USD, dans un contexte où les mineurs vendent 30 millions USD en ether chaque jour sur le marché secondaire. Cette pression de vente disparaîtra d'ici la fin de l'été, et sera remplacée par un incitatif à retirer de l'ether de la circulation (pour obtenir le rendement de 10%). Cet ether staké, rappelons-le, touchera 30% des revenus du réseau, avec des dépenses absolument minimes – la marge de profits du réseau dépassera 95%. 

Résumé grossièrement : Moins de vendeurs (les mineurs disparaissent) + plus d'acheteurs (les investisseurs qui retirent de l'ether de la circulation pour capturer 30% des revenus en le stakant) + un passage à une technologie verte + un monde de plus en plus numérique + une nouvelle économie bâtie sur Ethereum = le prix de l'ether va inévitablement augmenter. 

**En conclusion** 

Je suis conscient que ce post interminable ne va pas convaincre tout le monde, et c'est bien correct comme ça. Je n'encourage personne à faire un investissement basé sur mon analyse, je ne suis qu'un idiot avec un avatar de lion derrière son clavier. Mais on m'a souvent demandé de justifier mon intérêt envers cette classe d'actifs, et c'est maintenant chose faite. À vous de décider si mon idée fait du sens ou pas. 

Je suis très curieux de lire vos commentaires et vos critiques. J'aimerais simplement que cela se fasse dans le respect. Si vous pensez que la crypto n'est qu'un scam/un ponzi, merci de vous abstenir, la conversation ne mènera nulle part. Mais pour tous les autres, gâtez-vous! Je veux mettre ma thèse à l'épreuve. 

Quant à mes positions : j'ai évidemment beaucoup d'ether, autant sur un Ledger que dans mon CELI via le FNB ETHH. L'ether dans mon Ledger est staké, pas celui dans le CELI puisque c'est impossible ; j'ai aussi des OTM call options pour décembre 2022 (strikes de 5k et 8k).",40.0,2022-05-18 17:05:34,0.75

the only way the Ethereum would ever accomplish mainstream status is through this merge. Energy consumption will go down by 99% meaning that Ethereum will finally be able to experience mass mainstream adoption.,"Some people are really underestimating what this merge means exactly. A lot of people know that it will definitely drive consumption WAY lower, but not many realize that this means Ethereum is going one step forward towards attaining mainstream status.

Aside from the fact that retail companies are pushing all in for eco-friendliness, these companies can’t operate on Ethereum as long as it's PoW.

Of course, we still need to wait for sharding for Ethereum to actually start showing its real efficiency, but there are already enough scaling solutions to compensate for that in my opinion.

These scaling solutions and L2s aren’t playing. Polygon alone has already partnered with so many mainstream traditional companies like Ernst & Young, Dolce & Gabbana, Twitter, Instagram and most importantly Stripe which is a BIG step for crypto as a whole considering Stripe is the 6th largest Fintech company in the world and the 5th most used payment app in the US.

And the fact that this company is using Ethereum (even if it’s through an EVM chain like Polygon) insights a lot of hope that Ethereum is on the right path toward mainstream adoption.",504.0,2022-05-14 16:30:26,0.83

"I know what I own. We invest, not purchase.","And by this I mean I know where my money is.

Let's do a recap of what has happened:

\- SOL implodes, again.

\- BTC goes down in price and people who were celebrating $30k last year are now crying in $30k.

\- SOL implodes... again.

\- ETH gas fees are on a arm wrestling contest with petrol to see what gas is more expensive.

\- The world is in war and oh? SOL imploded, again.

\- UST loses its peg, making people doubt massively other stablecoin like USDT and USDC even. LUNA liquidates its BTC and UST is still not pegged to the USD. All hell gets lose with those who staked for APY.

\- The stock market looks like the crypto market.

Ok.

Here is my perspective.

I own Ethereum, Tezos and Bitcoin. In that order. Hate me all you want, but yes. I have a small bit of DOT on some parachains but that is locked until SOL stops imploding.

Anyways this is what I focus on:

\- Ethereum has ETH2.0 on its way and I have it staked so i can't sell. Also, the recent updates have been promising for the merge.

\- Tezos has always had an organic growth and it works as good as always: scales, upgrades and the fees are well regulated thanks to the voting community.

\- Bitcoin works as always. Low fees on segwit, still making blocks like clockwork and has a bulletproof network. No imploding - reliability.

And this is what I focus on: 1 ETH = 1 ETH, 1 XTZ = 1 XTZ, 1 BTC = 1 BTC and 1 SOL = 1 Little Boy. Oh, and 1 UST = 0.69 USD.

My endpoint is to please focus on what you have bought. Why have you invested, not why has the price gone down.

The price is down because the world is in fucking shit. Fuel prices are higher than ever, an average job cannot afford you an average house and there is a WWIII brewing to the right of us. This is why the price is down.

Focus on your mentality as an investor, not as a customer.",33.0,2022-05-10 20:48:55,0.71

**Frequently Asked Questions**

**Where's the best place to buy ETH?**

There are many centralized exchanges that support Ethereum. If you live in the US, the most popular exchanges are Coinbase, Gemeni and Kraken. Coinbase users can use Coinbase Pro for lower fees.

**When is Eth2 launching?**

Eth2 is a marketing term used to represent a number of updates to Ethereum. The Eth2 proof-of-stake chain first launched in December 2020. ""The Merge"", which is the event that will fully switch Ethereum's consensus to proof-of-stake, is estimated to be ready in early 2022, although there is no exact timeline. Other updates, such as data shards, will follow that update.

Visit [ethmerge.com](https://ethmerge.com/) to learn more about ""The Merge"".

**Do I need to do anything to update to Eth2? Will Eth2 create a new token?**

No, ETH holders *never* need to take any action to keep holding ETH. Ethereum users will be unaffected by the Eth2 upgrade. And the Eth2 updates will not create any new tokens.

**How can I stake my ETH?**

There are two ways that you can stake your ETH: by running your own validator, or providing your ETH to a staking pool.

* Running your own validator requires a modern computer and 32 ETH. Visit /r/ethstaker for more details
* Staking pools accept any amount of ETH. We recommend [Lido](https://lido.fi/) or [StakeWise](https://stakewise.io/)

**Why are Ethereum transaction fees so high?**

Like most blockchains, Ethereum fees are determined by supply-and-demand. The large demand to use Ethereum has pushed transaction fees quite high (however, fees were just a few cents only 2 years ago). Fees are especially high during market volatility, and during NFT drops.

**What is being done to lower Ethereum transaction fees?**

Ethereum fees are reduced by using layer-2 rollups. Rollups are scaling solutions that allow for significantly cheaper transactions, while still maintaining Ethereum's security.

Additionally, Eth2's data shards will make rollups even cheaper.

While rollups are cutting-edge technology being actively developed, a number are already live on Ethereum mainnet. Visit [l2beat.com](https://l2beat.com/) to learn more about rollups.

**What's the best wallet for Ethereum?**

The most popular tool for using decentralized applications is Metamask. However, for security reasons, we recommend using a hardware wallet such as a Trezor or Ledger.

Not heard much about the Ethereum difficulty bomb going off...,"The clock has stopped ticking and the bomb has gone off, mining is getting harder and blocks are already getting further apart.

Less blocks means more congestion, higher fees and more failed transactions, unless people stop using Ethereum as much.

The Merge isnt ready, will the devs race the bomb and try to complete it before disaster, or will the devs stop Merge and rollout a fork to reset the difficulty bomb?

Even if the devs reset the bomb, will nodes upgrade in time, especially if the devs leave it to the last minute?

EDIT: To everyone saying the bomb didnt go off https://ethresear.ch/t/blocks-per-week-as-an-indicator-of-the-difficulty-bomb/12120/14",238.0,2022-05-07 17:46:12,0.75
7 Reasons To Be Excited About Polygon In 2022,"Polygon has been making waves in Web3.0 since inception. But the recent development & activity has made crypto natives more bullish on the ecosystem than ever before.  


1. **Stripe X Polygon**  
Stripe, the global payments giant, is making its foray into the cryptoverse with Polygon. Soon, Stripe will allow business owners to pay using USDC. Plus, Twitter will be the first to use this! Imagine the possibilities...
2. **Underpinning blockchain in Lugano**  
Lugano is a pro-crypto city based in Switzerland and has decided to settle its stablecoin (USDT & LVGA) transactions on Polygon Thanks to its low fees The crypto-friendly Swiss town recently made Bitcoin and crypto legal tender.
3. **Investors❤️Polygon**  
Polygon has been massively funded In Feb, Polygon raised $450M in funding led by Asia’s biggest crypto investing firm Sequoia Capital with participation from leading global investors including: Animoca, Seven Seven Six & Kevin O’Leary aka Mr. Wonderful.
4. **Redpilling Web2.0 companies**  
Polygon is onboarding Web2.0 based companies into the decentralized world of Web3.0. Draft Kings, a NASDAQ-listed sports betting company, has partnered with Polygon & has announced setting up a validator’s node to help decentralize its PoS network.
5. **Frontrunning P2E gaming**  
Polygon Studios, the gaming/Metaverse arm of Polygon, is working at the forefront to bring GameFi & Metaverse to the masses. Guess who’s heading it? Ryan Wyatts— Ex-head of gaming at Youtube to build out the gaming division at Polygon.
6. **Supernet chains**  
Polygon has several other scaling solutions besides its famed & widely used PoS chain. One of them is Supernet Chains. These are a set of highly scalable interconnected chains allowing devs to build their projects in customizable environments with 0 costs. To incentivize devs to build on these Supernet Chains, the foundation has announced a $100M support fund.
7. **Hermez 2.0, NightFall, Avail, Miden, Zero (Plonky 2.0) - Launching Live / TestNet**  
The Polygon team will be launching Hermez 2.0 & NightFall to the livenet later this year. And Avail, Miden, and Zero chains will be hitting TestNet before the end of the year. These coupled with the Ethereum merge (expected in the Fall) will drive huge adoption. Also, don't forget an Enterprise chain is also in the works.

"Ethereum [ETH] has the fuel, but can it skyrocket by the end of 2022","Finder organized a panel of financial professionals to produce an updated price estimate for Ethereum. Ethereum is expected to end the year at a high of roughly $5800, according to the panel. For many reasons, this is significant news for the Ethereum community. 

For months, the Ethereum community has been in turmoil. With the impending Merge with a slew of other soft forks, this year was predicted to be their year of supremacy. Ethereum, on the other hand, has failed to live up to the hype. From its all-time high in November 2021 to about $2800, the Ethereum price has declined by more than 43%.

In the last two years, though, Ethereum has performed well in other sectors. The DeFi TVL in Ethereum has climbed 82 percent over the year, from $49.1 billion to $89.5 billion, according to a Bankless analysis. This metric represents the value of assets placed in Ethereum-based DeFi protocols including decentralized exchanges, money markets, and option vaults. 

The growing interest in NFTs, which are the largest created on the Ethereum blockchain (and includes play to earn game based NFTs like Bored Ape Yacht and Sandbox and; green efficient projects like Plastiks and Cycled), has also benefitted Ethereum. The total volume of NFT sales on Ethereum is $25.6 billion, which is significantly higher than the next four combined. 

However, the panel remains skeptical of Ethereum, citing the emergence of competing platforms during this moment of macro-turbulence. Finder's cryptocurrency editor, Keegan Francis, says,

""Ethereum is now at a highly insecure point in its journey. Ethereum is currently losing DeFi market share to its competitors, despite the fact that it still has a big lead.... ""I don't believe Ethereum will ever be a second cryptocurrency."" 

Joseph Raczynski, a panelist and a Thomson Reuters technologist, likewise warns that, 

""It (Ethereum) should be more safe, energy-efficient, and deflationary."" As a leading blockchain, if it isn't the trifecta of promise, I don't know what is.""",21.0,2022-05-06 18:21:14,0.82

**Frequently Asked Questions**

**Where's the best place to buy ETH?**

There are many centralized exchanges that support Ethereum. If you live in the US, the most popular exchanges are Coinbase, Gemeni and Kraken. Coinbase users can use Coinbase Pro for lower fees.

**When is Eth2 launching?**

Eth2 is a marketing term used to represent a number of updates to Ethereum. The Eth2 proof-of-stake chain first launched in December 2020. ""The Merge"", which is the event that will fully switch Ethereum's consensus to proof-of-stake, is estimated to be ready in early 2022, although there is no exact timeline. Other updates, such as data shards, will follow that update.

Visit [ethmerge.com](https://ethmerge.com/) to learn more about ""The Merge"".

**Do I need to do anything to update to Eth2? Will Eth2 create a new token?**

No, ETH holders *never* need to take any action to keep holding ETH. Ethereum users will be unaffected by the Eth2 upgrade. And the Eth2 updates will not create any new tokens.

**How can I stake my ETH?**

There are two ways that you can stake your ETH: by running your own validator, or providing your ETH to a staking pool.

* Running your own validator requires a modern computer and 32 ETH. Visit /r/ethstaker for more details
* Staking pools accept any amount of ETH. We recommend [Lido](https://lido.fi/) or [StakeWise](https://stakewise.io/)

**Why are Ethereum transaction fees so high?**

Like most blockchains, Ethereum fees are determined by supply-and-demand. The large demand to use Ethereum has pushed transaction fees quite high (however, fees were just a few cents only 2 years ago). Fees are especially high during market volatility, and during NFT drops.

**What is being done to lower Ethereum transaction fees?**

Ethereum fees are reduced by using layer-2 rollups. Rollups are scaling solutions that allow for significantly cheaper transactions, while still maintaining Ethereum's security.

Additionally, Eth2's data shards will make rollups even cheaper.

While rollups are cutting-edge technology being actively developed, a number are already live on Ethereum mainnet. Visit [l2beat.com](https://l2beat.com/) to learn more about rollups.

**What's the best wallet for Ethereum?**

The most popular tool for using decentralized applications is Metamask. However, for security reasons, we recommend using a hardware wallet such as a Trezor or Ledger.

"Even with ETH2.0 rolling out, gas fees will stay high. L2s will always be needed.","A lot of people think that ETH2.0 will solve the problem of gas fees. But this is a huge misconception actually.
The main two points of ETH2.0 are the merge and sharding.

While the merge will drastically reduce energy consumption (up to 99%) that’s literally all its goin to do. It has nothing to do with gas fees. It won’t affect it any significant way.

Sharding on the other hand will definitely help lower gas fees but now in a direct manner. Sharding will help L2s and other scaling solution be more efficient which in turn will lower gas fees on Ethereum in a non direct way.

This is why you should NEVER dump your L2 coins. If anything yall should start accumulating cause the prices of L2 tokens will most probably rise.

I have my bets on Cartesi right now cause their technology is comparable to the major players in the game except they’re build on Linux which will definitely give them an edge when it comes to adoption cause we all know that the majority of operating systems run Linux.

Hopefully, with time, the traffic problem that’s plaguing Ethereum would eventually be solved but until then we’re going to keep relying heavily on L2s.",115.0,2022-04-30 14:25:18,0.91
Rocket Pool now supports Besu and Nethermind in their beta release,"I'm obsessed with the way that Rocket Pool continues to iterate on their smartnode stack to increase network health and participation from the community. This is what decentralization looks like.

From the Rocket Pool discord #beta announcements channel:

> Attention @Beta Tester node operators!

> We have just made a beta of v1.3.2 available for you to test!

> It adds support for new Execution clients: Nethermind and Besu! If you would like to bolster the health and diversity of the Execution layer (ETH1), you can now use these instead of Geth.

> Switching clients is as simple as changing your setting in the Execution Client dropdown of the TUI.

> This is meant for testing on the Prater testnet ONLY. DO NOT run this on Mainnet.

> NOTE: Light clients (Infura and Pocket) are now DEPRECATED because the upcoming Ethereum Merge is NOT COMPATIBLE with them. You will be required to run a full Execution client after the merge, and the light clients will be removed in a future version of the Smartnode accordingly.",41.0,2022-04-29 13:01:15,0.98
To any new comer. The merge will reduce energy consumption by a huge margin but won’t have a significant affect on gas fees. Sharding is what will reduce gas fees.,"
While a considerable number of users on the subreddit have been using Ethereum, L2s and sidechains for a while, there are also new comers joining everyday (niceeee).

I’m seeing a couple posts here and there about “how will the merge affect gas fees?” and comments about “should I sell my L2 and sidechain tokens?”

The answer is no. In fact, the merge will most probably drive more activity on the platform making traffic worse which might theoretically increase the demand on scaling solutions overall.

The end goal is to reach ETH2.0 which is a phenomenally more advanced version of the Ethereum we have now. But that will happen in slow steps and phases. Part of these steps is lowering energy consumption which is the whole idea behind the merge from PoW to PoS.

For now keep your L2 tokens and maybe even accumulate more to cash in on a decent profit. Personally I’m betting my money on Polygon. They already have the largest number of daily active users between all scaling solutions plus it kinda easiest to build on seeing that they already have 19,000 dApps onboard.

I also think Optimism might have a chance at making it big especially after the recent updates with the token release but I tend to lean more towards zk tech honestly cause I personally think it’s much more superior and has more potential for the long term.",130.0,2022-04-29 01:26:08,0.93
ETH 2.0/ Merge Impact on LRC??,"Discussion- crypto wrinkle brains help me out. I want to understand what impact the Merge/ ETH 2.0 will have on Loopring protocol and my LRC investment.

As I understand, the Merge (this summer/fall?) will result in MUCH lower ETH gas fees for everyone. Ethereum will transition from proof of work to proof of stake. Great!

One of Loopring’s main selling points (correct me if im wrong), is lower gas on L2. 

Questions:
1. Will we lose competitive advantage after Merge? 
2. Does Merge have anything to do with L2’s?
3. Should I be worried or excited?

I’m curious to hear everyone’s thoughts. Btw- I cannot stop buying LRC and love the community on Discord!

Thanks,

"No, ""ETH 2.0"" will NOT reduce transaction fees","First of all, Eth 2.0 does not exist. It is named ""The merge"" and is the second of 3 Ethereum upgrades. ""The merge"" and ""Shard chains"" are yet to come out. The first upgrade, ""The beacon chain"" is currently live.

The most common misconception on this subreddit is that when eth 2.0 comes out, transaction fees will be lower or even non-existent. That is completely false.

The upgrade will have an impact on the consensus layer. Gas fees are paid on the execution layer of Ethereum. So, unfortunately, gas fees will not be cheaper and we must stop having wrong expectations. 

More activity on Ethereum blockchain = higher fees

Less activity on Ethereum blockchain = lower fees

Those fees that you are paying now will simply go to staking Ethereum instead of miners as it does currently.

&#x200B;

What the merge WILL do, is make Ethereum eco-friendly. The transition to proof of stake makes the network 2000 times more energy-efficient, requiring 99.5% less energy to process transactions. 

Security will be better, and the merge will most likely have a positive influence on ETH price as staking is encouraged. In the transition to POS, fewer Ether tokens will be minted thus lowering inflation.

For comparison, ETH is staked at around 8.3%, while ADA is at 73%, so there is huge space for upside. 

All in all, still bullish on Ethereum",619.0,2022-04-22 19:12:10,0.85

Should you keep buying GPUs? An Analysis,"The primary metric crypto miners look at is ROI, aka will they make enough crypto to offset their investment in equipment and costs. Ignoring taxes and making a few assumptions, crypto miners will make approximately $4 USD a day per 100 MH/s between now and October 1. October 1 is a reasonably cautious date to expect The Merge; it will likely be later. The rise in hash rate decreasing profits is partially balanced by the 5GB DAG coming in late August, which will knock some ASICs and GPUs off. The below makes assumptions; a 3080 card's hash rate and power usage will vary.

A stable $4 a day means $120 a month per a 3080 card running at 100mh/s. Using 240 Watts at $0.10 a kWh, it will use $17.28 in power a month, resulting in a monthly net gain of $102.72. An October 1 merge will mean that if you start mining from May 1, you will make $513.60. A 3080 currently costs ~$1000 on Newegg, which means you will have lost $486.40 from an ROI perspective. However, that ignores that a GPU has value even if it can't mine Ethereum.

From late 2018 to early 2019, ETH price crashed from a high of $1118 in Jan 2018 to a low of $107.06 in Jan 2019. During the rise, the cost of cards went up nearly 2.5x and then, after the crash, went back down and began selling at MSRP. Used cards were cheaper than MSRP, but newer cards in high demand only sold at a slight discount. According to a 2021 survey, there are 120 million Steam users, with 3.8% having a 3000 series graphics card and less than 0.5% having a 6000 series AMD card. This indicates that there are a lot of gamers who have room to upgrade their GPU. There are approximately 1,000 TH/s of hash rate on Ethereum, which would take 10 million 3080 GPUs to reproduce.

Post-merge, assuming a 40% depreciation, a $1000 investment in a 3080 today will net you $113.60, a 11.36% return on your investment in 5 months which works out to a 27.26% return annually. Crypto-mining seems far better than the 1% you'd make in the bank.

Author's note: The above assumes no taxes, that Ethereum's price stays stable, and fair power rates. Many miners mine at more than 10 cents per kWh or cannot obtain a 3080 for $1000. The above also ignores the cost of a rig, downtime, labor costs, and other misc fees that will cut into your profit margin. There is a slight chance of The Merge occurring earlier than October 1 or that a 3080 will depreciate more than 40%. Do your research, and don't take risks you can't afford.",45.0,2022-04-21 16:14:38,0.87

**Frequently Asked Questions**

**Where's the best place to buy ETH?**

There are many centralized exchanges that support Ethereum. If you live in the US, the most popular exchanges are Coinbase, Gemeni and Kraken. Coinbase users can use Coinbase Pro for lower fees.

**When is Eth2 launching?**

Eth2 is a marketing term used to represent a number of updates to Ethereum. The Eth2 proof-of-stake chain first launched in December 2020. ""The Merge"", which is the event that will fully switch Ethereum's consensus to proof-of-stake, is estimated to be ready in early 2022, although there is no exact timeline. Other updates, such as data shards, will follow that update.

Visit [ethmerge.com](https://ethmerge.com/) to learn more about ""The Merge"".

**Do I need to do anything to update to Eth2? Will Eth2 create a new token?**

No, ETH holders *never* need to take any action to keep holding ETH. Ethereum users will be unaffected by the Eth2 upgrade. And the Eth2 updates will not create any new tokens.

**How can I stake my ETH?**

There are two ways that you can stake your ETH: by running your own validator, or providing your ETH to a staking pool.

* Running your own validator requires a modern computer and 32 ETH. Visit /r/ethstaker for more details
* Staking pools accept any amount of ETH. We recommend [Lido](https://lido.fi/) or [StakeWise](https://stakewise.io/)

**Why are Ethereum transaction fees so high?**

Like most blockchains, Ethereum fees are determined by supply-and-demand. The large demand to use Ethereum has pushed transaction fees quite high (however, fees were just a few cents only 2 years ago). Fees are especially high during market volatility, and during NFT drops.

**What is being done to lower Ethereum transaction fees?**

Ethereum fees are reduced by using layer-2 rollups. Rollups are scaling solutions that allow for significantly cheaper transactions, while still maintaining Ethereum's security.

Additionally, Eth2's data shards will make rollups even cheaper.

While rollups are cutting-edge technology being actively developed, a number are already live on Ethereum mainnet. Visit [l2beat.com](https://l2beat.com/) to learn more about rollups.

**What's the best wallet for Ethereum?**

The most popular tool for using decentralized applications is Metamask. However, for security reasons, we recommend using a hardware wallet such as a Trezor or Ledger.

Ethereum validator economics,"Can you stake more than 32 ETH (let’s say 1,000 ETH) and still be a validator (albeit a bigger validator)?

Also, what happens to my returns between now (pre merge) and once the merge is complete?",22.0,2022-04-17 10:12:39,0.92
Expecting a huge pump in MATIC’s price soon and here’s why,"This is of course taking into consideration the fact that we need the market to go green first.

But here’s the thing. The ETH merge even will be happening soon. And while a lot of people think that this means gas fees will go down a issues arising from traffic on Ethereum will go away, this is only a misconception.

The fact is, Ethereum will indeed upgrade but gas fees wont go down. One ETH dev went as far as saying that gas fees might even rise due to more traffic from people wanting to use the upgraded Ethereum blockchain.

This means that scaling solutions will be needed more than ever and so far Polygon has proven to be the best combination of consistency, quickness, reliability and cheap transactions.

If anything Polygon has the largest number of daily active users compared to all other scaling solutions.

So in general all scaling solutions will rise in value but you could bet your money that Matic will be the one to skyrocket between all its other competitors.",47.0,2022-04-15 08:28:18,0.89
"Ethereum price targets $10,000 despite merge delays","After recovering from the recent crypto market massacre, the price of Ethereum may rise as is BTC, $BNB and $Crayon. The introduction of the altcoin's consensus layer, as well as the transition from Proof-of-Work to Proof-of-Stake, has been put back to Q3 2022. 

The Ethereum merger has been postponed until Q3 2022. 
As Ethereum transitions from Proof-of-Work to Proof-of-Stake, the Merge is a much-anticipated event among Ethereum holders. The Ethereum development team renamed the update ""consensus layer"" instead than ""ETH2"" in January 2022.

An Ethereum core engineer, Tim Bieko, verified that the protocol's anticipated switch to Proof-of-Stake is set for Q3 2022. While the cause for the delay is unknown, Bieko acknowledged that this is the ""last chapter of Proof-of-Work."" 

According to Parit Hosh, a Validator Whisperer at the Ethereum Foundation, the final testnet phase might span three months. The testnet's early completion is critical for the mainnet's introduction of the consensus layer. 

Proponents believe the much-anticipated event will have a beneficial impact on the price of Ethereum. The Ethereum Triple Halving thesis, which anticipates a surge in ETH price comparable to three and a half Bitcoin halvings, was motivated by the inclusion of burn with the EIP-1559 protocol.

After a sharp drop in price over the previous week, FXStreet analysts assessed the Ethereum price trend. The Ethereum price has a swath of support extending from $2,800 to $3,000. 

According to analysts, Ethereum's slide below the high volume node around $3,300 is a bearish indicator, and the altcoin may remain stationary.",34.0,2022-04-14 19:12:09,0.81

An overwhelming amount of headlines that get upvoted here is confirmation bias rather then objectively correct information.,"All I see on this subreddit are misleading titles being upvoted by what seems like people who have no idea what is actually going on past just reading misleading headlines. Learn to think critically and for once, to actually be impartial to whatever bags you may or may not have. 


A recent example is the supposed ""delay"" in Ethereum's merge. You can't delay something that never had an agreed upon date. Rather then saying it how is, with Ethereum devs getting closer to a finalized date for the merge, misleading titles get upvoted by people seeking confirmation bias rather then trying to understand what is actually going on in the development process. 


It applies to Cardano the same way it applies to Ethereum and any other project. You'll never succeed in crypto if you keep trying to prove your biases right and refuse to see things for what they actually are. A successful investor considers facts rather then personal feelings.",704.0,2022-04-13 16:38:35,0.92

Loopring mentioned in Coindesk Daily email today!,"It's nice to see us getting mentioned more often now as a real solution to the ETH gas problems. While the recent shadow fork was a success, we're still a ways out until the merge. This should help Layer 2 solutions gain more popularity in the meantime! LFG!!! 

"" In the meantime, the focus has shifted away from the Ethereum network itself to layer 2 systems like “rollups,” which scale the Ethereum network off-chain while borrowing its essential security guarantees. An entire layer 2 industry has popped up to scale, or increase capacity on, Ethereum, with leading products such as Arbitrum, Optimism and Loopring allowing users to transact at a fraction of the cost of Ethereum, and attracting billions of dollars in combined total value locked (TVL) as a result.""",237.0,2022-04-13 11:35:06,0.99
Ethereum One Step Closer To PoS After Implementation of First Shadow Fork,"Ethereum developers have announced the first successful implementation of a “shadow fork” on the network, which is a big step towards shifting the network to proof-of-stake.

The shadow fork creates a platform for ETH developers to run tests before the networks shift from PoW to PoS. The Ethereum network’s merge into PoS is expected to make the network faster, cheaper, and more environmentally friendly due to the high energy consumption required to run PoW. The merge is expected to be fully implemented in the second half of 2022. So, if you are confident that it will go through without a hitch, then you might consider adding some ETH to your portfolio.

Do you think it's truly a big deal?

"If the market already has everything priced in, shouldn't the price of Ethereum already reflect the after-merge value?","If the market already has everything priced in, shouldn't the price of ETH already reflect the after-merge value? 

This is a genuine question. 

It's not like only a few know about it. It's public. People are counting down the says on Twitter. The merge is going to be a massive influence - miners, traders, everyone in crypto will be affected by it.

But ...doesn't the market already know, and by extension, indicate this?  You know, the whole ""buy the rumour, sell the news""... 

So, why am I seeing people saying the price will 'moon' soon? I'm inclined to believe that we could be equally likely to see a huge dump after the merge.",33.0,2022-04-11 06:28:36,0.75

**Frequently Asked Questions**

**Where's the best place to buy ETH?**

There are many centralized exchanges that support Ethereum. If you live in the US, the most popular exchanges are Coinbase, Gemeni and Kraken. Coinbase users can use Coinbase Pro for lower fees.

**When is Eth2 launching?**

Eth2 is a marketing term used to represent a number of updates to Ethereum. The Eth2 proof-of-stake chain first launched in December 2020. ""The Merge"", which is the event that will fully switch Ethereum's consensus to proof-of-stake, is estimated to be ready in early 2022, although there is no exact timeline. Other updates, such as data shards, will follow that update.

Visit [ethmerge.com](https://ethmerge.com/) to learn more about ""The Merge"".

**Do I need to do anything to update to Eth2? Will Eth2 create a new token?**

No, ETH holders *never* need to take any action to keep holding ETH. Ethereum users will be unaffected by the Eth2 upgrade. And the Eth2 updates will not create any new tokens.

**How can I stake my ETH?**

There are two ways that you can stake your ETH: by running your own validator, or providing your ETH to a staking pool.

* Running your own validator requires a modern computer and 32 ETH. Visit /r/ethstaker for more details
* Staking pools accept any amount of ETH. We recommend [Lido](https://lido.fi/) or [StakeWise](https://stakewise.io/)

**Why are Ethereum transaction fees so high?**

Like most blockchains, Ethereum fees are determined by supply-and-demand. The large demand to use Ethereum has pushed transaction fees quite high (however, fees were just a few cents only 2 years ago). Fees are especially high during market volatility, and during NFT drops.

**What is being done to lower Ethereum transaction fees?**

Ethereum fees are reduced by using layer-2 rollups. Rollups are scaling solutions that allow for significantly cheaper transactions, while still maintaining Ethereum's security.

Additionally, Eth2's data shards will make rollups even cheaper.

While rollups are cutting-edge technology being actively developed, a number are already live on Ethereum mainnet. Visit [l2beat.com](https://l2beat.com/) to learn more about rollups.

**What's the best wallet for Ethereum?**

The most popular tool for using decentralized applications is Metamask. However, for security reasons, we recommend using a hardware wallet such as a Trezor or Ledger.

Defichain and the 'Bitcoin DeFi' narrative,"\[*Little introduction, can be skipped*\]. What follows are some thoughts about the Bitcoin narrative that is associated with Defichain. A narrative is in this context a story around something, that identifies what it is, what it was, what it aims to be, and the sort of values that it endorses. Narratives are important. We arguably use narratives to shape our own identity and lives. Countries and religions often revolve around narratives. In the case of a project like Defichain, a narrative can help identify what it is to others, the sort of vision it has, the sort values that the community should orient around, and so on. More concretely, the narrative can obviously play a role in marketing and communication efforts, in governance, and in what to build. Obviously, narratives are also risky, they can become dogmatic, stifle change; a narrative can also be misleading or fail to match the identity of something. Sometimes one should change direction to steer the course of the narrative, sometimes one should take a step back and reflect on whether the narrative should not be changed instead.

&#x200B;

**The Bitcoin Defi Narrative**

The central narrative that is associated with Defichain is that of ‘Bitcoin-based DeFi’, witness the [Defichain.com](https://Defichain.com) website, or the little introductory box here on Reddit top right. This narrative identifies it as an instrument for decentralized finance of course (which is relatively unproblematic) but also sets it apart from the majority of existing DeFi projects by associating it in some way or other with Bitcoin. This makes it more unique. This is what drew me to Defichain, personally.

I wonder however whether there is not a mismatch between this narrative and Defichain in its current state and with its current aims. Of course this is question of what exactly one should expect from ‘Bitcoin DeFi’, and I don’t know exactly. DeFi on Ethereum is literally built on it, it helps support Ethereum through fees and, in some cases, locking up ETH. One may therefore come to the concept of ‘Bitcoin DeFi’ expecting some or all of these things. Defichain is not literally built on bitcoin, no fees are paid in BTC, and usage of DFI doesn’t lock up BTC (or drive up demand for Bitcoin). One may think that DeFichain is built like Bitcoin, but with the addition of the EVM, this will not be so evident either.

Defichain is currently under the radar. It’s quickly growing however. Coingecko listed Defichain next to Liquid, RSK, and Stacks (see the [awesome post here](https://www.reddit.com/r/defiblockchain/comments/txo3zx/why_defichain_is_built_differently/)). As things currently stand, these protocols have a stronger connection to Bitcoin however. Liquid and RSK in particular lock up BTC for their pegs (thus increasing demand for BTC) and support bitcoin miners (for example via merge mining on RSK).

So I worry about the following; if Defichain continues to use the Bitcoin DeFi narrative, it will be thrown in the Bitcoin DeFi basket, and I think we can expect community members from Liquid, RSK and Stacks, and most importantly Bitcoiners of various sorts, to go on the attack. (One example of this is the attack of Adam Back on Muneeb from Stacks, some time ago, see e.g. [here](https://twitter.com/adam3us/status/1447174344967401480)). More importantly, depending on how the concept of ‘Bitcoin DeFi’ develops, people might come to Defichain expecting certain things and then not find them. This is not meant to be FUD. Being vulnerable to potential criticism, and a potential source of disappointment are weak spots. Just as one tries to spot weak spots in code pre-emptively, I think these weak spots, if they are indeed there, are just as well better dealt with before they act up.

So, if this is right, then what to do? Below some possible ways forward (perhaps there are others).

*(1) Take control over the concept of ‘Bitcoin DeFi’ and try to shape it in such a way that people don’t expect things from it that Defichain doesn’t offer.*

It is not entirely obvious how to do this; perhaps by making Turing incompleteness central, or having Bitcoin-grade security, or in more loose sense being built *like* Bitcoin. This is very hard to do however, concepts tend to live their own lives and don’t let themselves be engineered so easily. Also, whatever it means, it seems to me that the concept of 'Bitcoin DeFi' would require bitcoiners (whatever that means exactly) adopting this concept, and I don’t see a concept that loosens the association with bitcoin being adopted easily by bitcoiners.

*(2) Incentivize building a stronger association with Bitcoin for Defichain.*

This is the option of doubling down on the Bitcoin Defi identity. One could think of finding ways to build things such as the following:

* Make the atomic swap a priority, or perhaps even build a two-way peg that locks up bitcoin (the multiseg 2-way peg used on Rootstock might be an interesting model; the Defichain Foundation would then control the address)
* Incentivize Lightning integration, such as a lightning bridge into Defichain (maybe a fork of Boltz?)
* Have a recurrent transference of parts of the community fund to bitcoin, to build up a BTC fund (something [I proposed earlier](https://www.reddit.com/r/defiblockchain/comments/r54zco/community_fund_building_up_a_partial_fund_in_sats/) with these things here in the back of my mind, to be able to use the BTC to attract bitcoin-oriented devs building bitcoin things for Defichain paid for in BTC, but also as a way of supporting bitcoin).
* Support bitcoin development, or find ways to support the security budget.
* Other ideas anyone?

Roughly the aim would be to help support bitcoin the asset, bitcoinization and build more for a future bitcoinized society.

I find that these things would be very exciting. Note however, that building things is costly and it's not clear that the community could be motivated to pay these costs. Build a bridge to Avalanche and there is a community that will take note of Defichain, welcome Defichain, and this would generate publicity for Defichain. Building for the Bitcoin community is nothing like this. There will be no welcome with open arms. These things are very hard to build and, I expect, would not seem to have much effect initially, at least not as much as bridges to other L1s with dedicated communities. Doing things against the grain of market incentives is always very risky in my opinion, and requires a very strong and focused commitment to the Bitcoin DeFi narrative, as it can seem bad game theory. Also, this requires people to step up to do this, and these might simply not be there.

Having said that, I think the Bitcoin DeFi narrative might turn out to be sometimes worth making sacrifices for, as it seems to be catching on a little. Also uniqueness, and maintaining that uniqueness and preserving it, is valuable.

*(3) Move away from the Bitcoin DeFi narrative to another narrative.*

Given some of the hurdles mentioned for the other options, perhaps it is better to move to another narrative. The obvious question then is what? 

Of course the obvious candidate here would be NativeDefi, that is also used by Defichain (introduced by Uzyn I believe). Here too, one may worry however that it fits Defichain in its current shape but arguably will fit it less so when the Meta Chain is added, or in more complex ways. It also doesn't currently have much entrenchment. Perhaps it makes sense to look for a better narrative altogether, other than ‘Bitcoin DeFi’ or ‘NativeDeFi’. Any original thoughts on this would be great to hear.

*(4) Drop narratives altogether, let Defichain be sui generis, Defichain is Defichain.*

This is an option that leaves any narrative formation to the external environment it embeds in; if it is perceived as Bitcoin DeFi then fine, if it isn't, then that's fine too. Let a narrative emerge instead of trying to shape it. There is something to be said for this, but a narrative can be a powerful thing. Like I said, I'm here myself entirely because of the Bitcoin DeFi narrative, without it, I would probably not be.

I don't find it very obvious myself what would be best (and feasible!), but I incline towards the second option if there are ways to attract people. But I see the hurdles, and perhaps this is one of these cases that fitting narrative to project instead of the other way around is the better way to go (also with the move to the Meta Chain), idk.

*So curious to hear if anyone else has thoughts on this. Is there a mismatch between Defichain and the Bitcoin Defi narrative? If so, do you think anything should be done about it? If so, what?*",23.0,2022-04-09 20:43:04,1.0

Most suitable money for metaverses,"Considering the events currently taking place in the world, one begins to understand why more and more people prefer to escape reality into virtual worlds - metaverses where you can realize any of your dreams and live your life to the fullest. Even though most of humanity does not yet take the concept of the metaverses seriously, with each new generation the population of virtual worlds will increase.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/kut5cb6s04s81.jpg?width=1200&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=13528fe3915f6f3ce2d9ae8e2843eb8202f03fbb

The huge potential of the metaverses is already obvious to many IT companies, and such giants as Meta and Microsoft are conducting vast developments to improve digital worlds, not only technically, but also economically.

 ***In these series of articles we delve into the topic of alternative currencies which can substitute less effective currencies and improve the economy.*** ***Today metaverses comprise a substantial part of the world economy and we shall investigate the currencies behind them.***

metaverses continuously develop, with many opportunities appearing in them on a regular basis, allowing one to merge the virtual realm with real life. Inside these digital worlds, users can not only communicate and play, but also work, do business, be creative, trade virtual property and assets. It’s not a game anymore, it's a huge part of our life.  

The basis of any metaverse is the digital economy, since it serves as a bridge between a simple Internet game and real life inside the virtual space. And since the economy still cannot exist without money, each metaverse has its own currency.

*By the way, we have some ideas about a money-less economy, you can read more here*  [Can an economy live without money?](https://www.reddit.com/r/Reserveum/comments/svitji/can_an_economy_live_without_money/)

To date, there are several most popular metaverses, whose internal cryptocurrencies have outgrown their parent projects and are used outside of them:

• The Sandbox with SAND cryptocurrency;

• Decentraland and MANA cryptocurrency;

• Star Atlas using the ATLAS cryptocurrency.

 Next, let's take a look at each of these tokens and analyze the pros, cons, and prospects to see if one or more of them can be considered the ideal currency for the metaverse.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/i7n70flc14s81.jpg?width=1200&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b1f3c68b970b38bda09be27dd29fd4fde29ad44f

**SAND**

This token is based on ETH and is used to conduct transactions and interactions in the Sandbox metaverse. With SAND, users can trade digital lands and assets, but its use is not limited to gaming processes. The SAND token is used to attract investment in the project and is freely sold on the crypto exchange.

The Ethereum blockchain makes the token stable and secure, but still it cannot be an ideal currency due to such a drawback as the high gas fees inherent to all ERC-20 tokens.

**MANA**

Decentraland is another metaverse with a blockchain economy. The MANA token is used inside the game, but the popularity of the project makes it very promising. The main feature is the ability to monetize digital property created in the game. Players can earn money by creating digital objects and selling them, or, for example, placing banners with advertisements of real companies on their virtual plots of land.

**ATLAS**

The third metaverse cryptocurrency differs from the first two in that it is implemented on the Solana blockchain, and therefore it is decentralized, fast, serverless, secure and inexpensive. This token can be earned in the game and then exchanged for fiat or cryptocurrency, and players can not only earn by selling their gaming property, but even lend it to each other.

Apparently, we have a likely contender for the status of the ideal currency of the metaverse. The only caveat is that the project is still in development, and so far we can see the token only as an investment instrument on crypto exchanges. The graphics and wide range of features of the game make ATLAS a very attractive asset, but so far we do not know what the token will perform in practice, how its economy will function, and even more so whether it will be able to integrate into the real economy, like an ideal currency.

*We have already considered a possibility of substituting fiat currencies with existing cryptocurrencies.* *If this topic seems interesting, you can read our article*  [Dollar Sucks, but Bitcoin is Worse](https://www.reddit.com/r/Reserveum/comments/s62qw5/dollar_sucks_but_bitcoin_is_worse/)

The ideal metaverse cryptocurrency is a digital asset that can positively change our world. The work of companies such as Meta and Microsoft to launch global virtual universes that go beyond the physical world and constitute a new dimension will inevitably lead to the development of the virtual economy into an independent industry. And at such a scale, the currency of the metaverse will surely become an integral part of the global economy.

Therefore, it is very important already at the stage of developing the concept of the metaverse to create a cryptocurrency that will be effective both within the game, and within the ecosystem, and beyond. The developments of the Reserveum group aim at creating just such a currency, and at the current state of development, we have already managed to eliminate all the shortcomings of existing metauniversal currencies and provide the token with such qualities as security, decentralization and protection from inflation.

"Quick Update from Darcius on the Protocol - April 6, 2022","Posted by u/darcius in the #governance channel of the Rocket Pool Discord:

&#x200B;

I'm currently heavily Kiln focused and getting everything ready for Devconneeeect, but we are very much aware as a team of the needs and wants of the protocol currently, it's something we literally talk about daily and take into consideration when making decisions for the near and long term.  

With regard to the demand for node operators, we are definitely aware of this. The protocol has literally been designed to have built in incentives, running a RP node currently is by far the most profitable way to run a node on Ethereum. This means even if you're a bigtime SaaS provider or brand spankin new node operator, you can do better than anywhere else as a node operator currently.  

Saying that, we're aware the protocol is new, only 5 months old on mainnet and incentivising node operators to join is warranted to accomodate the huge demand to date. It is a new protocol though and is facing one of the biggest changes in Ethereum history (the merge). So caution for SaaS operators to join or any other commercial entity isn't unexpected until things are proven 📷  

We are looking at changes which involve running a node through a smart contract with several parties involved, this is a sustainable long term approach for node operator growth which can be added onto the protocol as a plugin should SaaS entities or others choose. I'm personally much more for long term growth initiatives such as this, we're only 5 months old on mainnet, so making decisions based on sustainable growth is important now.  

As far as marketing goes, running a node is a very specific job and appealing to that role requires tact, we definitely want more node operators, but just throwing up banner ads won't accomplish this. We're involved in establishing a long term marketing strategy which can appeal to these users (merge... miners) and SaaS providers. This is very much underway.  

We do bi-weekly updates now where we indicate what we're currently working on and aiming for, both in tech and growth. On top of that info though, we are definitely long term focused, that's something I'm super proud of and it's one of the reasons we're still here after all this time. Focusing on growth, the merge and beyond (withdrawals) is all in our scope. Some things we can include in the updates and some we can't as they may still be a WIP or in talks. I'd like to think we've been one of the most open projects to date by far on Ethereum.

Execution client majority - why so little is written about the issue?,"According to some people it is equally bad to run majority execution client as it is to run consensus client - both for the network and for the stakers involved (penalties in case of a failure).

For example:

""All of this applies in the same way to the execution client. Should Go-ethereum, likely to be the majority execution client after the merge, produce an invalid block, it could get finalized and thus cause the catastrophic failure""

source: [https://dankradfeist.de/ethereum/2022/03/24/run-the-majority-client-at-your-own-peril.html](https://dankradfeist.de/ethereum/2022/03/24/run-the-majority-client-at-your-own-peril.html)

However it doesn't seem like many write about it - there are articles but not many. I've read multiple guides in the last couple of days and they all warn about Prysm or at least mention other consensus clients but not that many put any emphasis at all on execution client diversity. Even the very official ethereum launchpad has a very prominent warning about using Prysm but not about using Geth.

**Frequently Asked Questions**

**Where's the best place to buy ETH?**

There are many centralized exchanges that support Ethereum. If you live in the US, the most popular exchanges are Coinbase, Gemeni and Kraken. Coinbase users can use Coinbase Pro for lower fees.

**When is Eth2 launching?**

Eth2 is a marketing term used to represent a number of updates to Ethereum. The Eth2 proof-of-stake chain first launched in December 2020. ""The Merge"", which is the event that will fully switch Ethereum's consensus to proof-of-stake, is estimated to be ready in early 2022, although there is no exact timeline. Other updates, such as data shards, will follow that update.

Visit [ethmerge.com](https://ethmerge.com/) to learn more about ""The Merge"".

**Do I need to do anything to update to Eth2? Will Eth2 create a new token?**

No, ETH holders *never* need to take any action to keep holding ETH. Ethereum users will be unaffected by the Eth2 upgrade. And the Eth2 updates will not create any new tokens.

**How can I stake my ETH?**

There are two ways that you can stake your ETH: by running your own validator, or providing your ETH to a staking pool.

* Running your own validator requires a modern computer and 32 ETH. Visit /r/ethstaker for more details
* Staking pools accept any amount of ETH. We recommend [Lido](https://lido.fi/) or [StakeWise](https://stakewise.io/)

**Why are Ethereum transaction fees so high?**

Like most blockchains, Ethereum fees are determined by supply-and-demand. The large demand to use Ethereum has pushed transaction fees quite high (however, fees were just a few cents only 2 years ago). Fees are especially high during market volatility, and during NFT drops.

**What is being done to lower Ethereum transaction fees?**

Ethereum fees are reduced by using layer-2 rollups. Rollups are scaling solutions that allow for significantly cheaper transactions, while still maintaining Ethereum's security.

Additionally, Eth2's data shards will make rollups even cheaper.

While rollups are cutting-edge technology being actively developed, a number are already live on Ethereum mainnet. Visit [l2beat.com](https://l2beat.com/) to learn more about rollups.

**What's the best wallet for Ethereum?**

The most popular tool for using decentralized applications is Metamask. However, for security reasons, we recommend using a hardware wallet such as a Trezor or Ledger.

"How to stake on Ethereum, April 2022 Edition","Staking on the Ethereum beacon chain means locking up 32 Ether in a deposit contract and running a few pieces of software on a computer you control. We recognize that not everyone has 32 Ether, the skills, or the hardware to do this, so we support other ways to stake. It's important to acknowledge that this guide is based on [my](https://twitter.com/superphiz) perception of best practice - the foundation of that best practice is that decentralization is best for the network and everyone's deposits will be most valuable when the network is most decentralized. Centralized providers provide a service that may degrade the overall decentralization of the network and cause your deposits to be less valuable over time. I strongly encourage every participant to stake in the most decentralized way they can, even if it means learning new skills to achieve this. 

These options are organized by benefit to the network and difficulty. If an option doesn't make sense to you, keep reading until you get to one that does.

What has changed in the past month? 

* The Prysm supermajority has been dissolved. According to [pools.invis.cloud](https://pools.invis.cloud/), use of the Prysm consensus client has fallen below 66%. This is excellent news for the overall health of the network, but stakers are still encouraged to use other clients in order to balance the use of the four Consensus layer clients. Learn more at [clientdiversity.org](https://clientdiversity.org/).

* [Lido](https://lido.finance) currently governs [24% of the validators](https://www.rated.network/) on the beacon chain and this is likely to continue increasing into the merge. While Lido is considered an honest entity, any entity who controls more than 20% of the network begins to threaten the decentralization of the entire network.

* Geth is a highly dominant Execution Layer client, and while it has been hardened over many years, the high dominance of any single client is contrary to the multi-client ethos of Ethereum development. This month we'll be encouraging increased use of other [Execution clients](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/nodes-and-clients/client-diversity/), namely [Besu](https://besu.hyperledger.org/en/stable/HowTo/Get-Started/Installation-Options/Install-Binaries/).

* The merge has not been scheduled, but we're getting closer. Core developers determined that more testing was needed before agreeing on a merge date. We can assume the merge will not happen in June, but we should have a better idea of the timeline in April. To keep up with the merge, follow calls on the [Ethereum Foundation YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/c/EthereumFoundation) and follow [Tim Beiko](https://twitter.com/TimBeiko), [Ben Edgington](https://twitter.com/benjaminion_xyz), and [Trent Van Epps](https://twitter.com/trent_vanepps) on Twitter.

* All solo stakers and Rocket Pool minipool operators will be required to run a local Execution client (geth, besu, erigon, nethermind) after the merge. Many guides suggest the use of Infura or other data providers, but using a remote data provider will not allow users to propose blocks after the merge. 

----

**Solo Staking**

Solo staking on the Ethereum beacon chain is the gold standard for staking. It is secure, provides full participation rewards, and improves decentralization of the network. People who are candidates for solo staking ought to meet a few requisites: at least 32 Ether, some technical ability, [hardware that can run 24/7](https://old.reddit.com/r/ethstaker/comments/rizos9/hardware_for_staking_2022_edition/), and at least 10Mbps Internet connection. Solo operators should seek to be as diverse as possible, this means staking on local hardware whenever possible, and using a staking client that is regarded as a [minority client](https://clientdiversity.org/). In April, 2022, I'd suggest using the [Nimbus staking client](https://someresat.medium.com/guide-to-staking-on-ethereum-2-0-ubuntu-nimbus-e86bdee8c550) or [Teku staking client](https://www.coincashew.com/coins/overview-eth/guide-or-how-to-setup-a-validator-on-eth2-mainnet). When staking, an execution client is also required, while most guides suggest geth, in April 2022, we recognize the need to diversify execution clients and suggest using the [Besu](https://besu.hyperledger.org/en/stable/HowTo/Get-Started/Installation-Options/Install-Binaries/) execution client. The [Ethereum Launchpad](https://launchpad.ethereum.org/en/) is a valuable resource for solo stakers, and [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpkpW031RCI) gives a broad overview of solo staking. The motto of a solo staker should be ""be online when every other staker is offline."" Solo validators are expected to test their setup and operational skills on the [prater](https://prater.beaconcha.in) testnet before risking funds. Persons who have many of the resources for solo staking but prefer a graphical management tool should check out the [stereum](https://stereum.net/) manager. Use of DappNode was previously discouraged due to lack of client diversity (they only supported Prysm), but now here is [strong evidence](https://twitter.com/DAppNode/status/1509479264466481155) that DappNode is offering multiclient support, and this is will be a valuable ""click to install"" solo staking method in the future. [Avado](https://twitter.com/AvadoCloud/status/1503448217903632387) has also announced support for the Teku client, a very valuable step toward further client diversity.

**Minipool operator**

Minipool operators are participants in [Rocket Pool](https://rocketpool.net). Rocket Pool is a trustless, open source, decentralized, and permissionless fractional staking platform. This means that any person can spin up a staking validator on Rocket Pool with 17.6 Ether (16 Ether and 1.6 Ether of RPL tokens) and help to secure the network. Rocket Pool works by taking your 16 Ether as a node operator and pairing it with 16 Ether from people who want to stake passively. For providing this service you'll earn rewards on your 16 Ether deposit, and some additional reward as payment from passive stakers that you are helping. Rocket Pool minipool operators are doing all of the same things that solo stakers are doing, but they can do this with less Ether and potentially higher rewards. Rocket pool has [extremely well-developed documentation](https://docs.rocketpool.net/guides/) and setting up a Rocket Pool node has been engineered to be easier than running a solo node. Rocket Pool minipool operators can also earn additional RPL rewards if they choose to stake more RPL on the platform, these rewards are currently very lucrative. As of April 2022, [Avado](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqPtcOAW5VI) supports ""click to install"" staking with Rocket Pool using the Prysm client; they have indicated that they are in the process of adding Teku. At this time, I believe that being a minipool operator on Rocket Pool may be as valuable to the decentralization of the network as being a solo operator. Here's the balance: As a solo node operator, you are staking as purely as possible and this is valuable, but as a Rocket Pool minipool operator, you're also supporting stakers who don't have enough Ether to stake in a decentralized way - this is equally valuable from a different angle. As time progresses I am more comfortable encouraging people to host Rocket Pool minipools. The [Rocket Pool Discord](https://discord.gg/rocketpool) \#Trading channel is well-regarded as a healthy source of information for decentralized staking on Ethereum.

----

**rEth holder**

[rEth](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/rocket-pool-eth) (Rocket Pool Ether) is a way for participants to passively stake on the Ethereum network. The minimum requirement for staking rEth is that you have at least 0.01 Eth (plus network gas fees) to stake, and that you know how to use metamask. If you use this [youtube search](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=staking+reth), you'll find several guides for converting Ether to rEth, if you're not sure which to pick, I'd suggest [this one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whsc7-9_JRs) or [this one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nx8kUaEXqIw). Staking with rEth means that your Eth is sent to the Rocket Pool network where it will be staked by a minipool operator, you'll receive all of the reward minus a small fee that goes to the person running the hardware. By holding rEth you're able to stake passively while still contributing to the decentralization of the Ethereum network and increasing the long-term value proposition of Ether. Rocket Pool does not take any profit from this exchange and does not receive any fees from your rEth staking. Rewards paid to rEth holders do not accrue on your rEth balance, instead, they accrue on the rEth exchange rate and are actualized when you exchange the token back for Ether. As a simple illustration, if you paid 1 Ether for 1 rEth at launch, you could sell your 1 rEth token back for 1.5 Ether at a later date. Your 1 rEth token will still be 1 token, but 1 rEth will be worth increasing amounts of Ether. For this reason, rEth will ALWAYS be more expensive than Ether when you exchange for it. As of April 2022, rEth is in very high demand and it may trade at a premium on open markets. A resolution to this for those who have 16 Ether is to operate their own minipool instead of purchasing rEth.

----

**Custodial Exchange staking**

Custodial staking is the least favorable method of staking on Ethereum because Exchanges tend to operate as centralized entities who control a lot of Ether. Centralized exchanges also have a poor history of client diversity as illustrated by [this data](https://pools.invis.cloud/). Poor client diversity puts the network at risk, and by extension lowers the long term value of Ether. With all of that in mind, if you cannot use metamask to buy rEth but you still want to stake your Ether, custodial exchange staking is still a better option than not staking at all. Based on current data for April, 2022, if you must stake in a custodial manner, [Bitcoin Suisse](https://www.bitcoinsuisse.com/staking/ethereum-2) is regarded as a high quality provider. I do encourage anyone who participates in exchange staking to take opportunities to learn more about staking in decentralized ways and exercise that opportunity as soon as it's available. To be very clear: I strongly discourage anyone from participating in custodial exchange staking except as a last resort. This option centralizes the network and undermines the value of Ether.

----

**But what about...**

This guide doesn't mention all staking options, only superphiz's highest recommendations for April 2022. There are literally hundreds of ways to stake, but I focus on the staking methods that contribute most to the overall health and decentralization of the Ethereum network.",187.0,2022-04-03 22:17:55,0.99

Will you stop buying GPUs once Ethereum's difficulty bomb gets a fixed release date?,"As per title.

I see a lot of people overestimating their ability to sell their GPUs once Ethereum goes POS... if one were to sell their GPUs today, you'll find both miners and gamers willing to take your cards off your hands for cheap.

But I'm afraid once the difficult bomb gets a release date, most if not all miners will stop buying GPUs. That means we'll have to compete against each other for buyers whom have been avoiding to upgrade for 2 years due to high market prices, while at the same time retail prices keep falling every day.

There's a pretty high chance that a lot of us that decide to sell our cards will be holding them for months, possibly more than a year, before finding buyers for all of them.

Which brings back to my question in the title. As a miner, will you stop buying cards once the difficulty bomb gets a release date?

Will you hold on purcharses until the merge to see if its still profitable to mine, before getting any new cards?

Or will you keep buying more cards regardless of what happens?",20.0,2022-03-31 21:24:25,0.76
the Merge is coming! a few things to expect,"Sharing [this thread](https://twitter.com/trent_vanepps/status/1508478499325202435?s=20&t=RQzPSM9y-R56aF0lAhcILQ) of Merge info so the community can get acquainted with what to expect in a few months.

1. Unburnt fees (aka tips) on the execution layer (EL) begin going each block's proposer - completely liquid on the EL. Over a typical week, this is \~14k ETH / $42mm
2. Due to the amount of work required to properly test and verify the Merge across all clients, Beacon Chain validator withdrawals of staked ETH are only expected to be included in the upgrade after (Shanghai). Work from [@ralexstokes](https://twitter.com/ralexstokes) has started [here](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4895)
3. Post-merge, blocks will arrive exactly every 12s. Today, they arrive in a poisson distribution around \~13s. For devs: do not assume \~13s blocktimes (eg. to calculate an interest rate) - please make sure to use timestamps.  More [here](http://blog.ethereum.org/2021/11/29/how-the-merge-impacts-app-layer/) from [@TimBeiko](https://twitter.com/TimBeiko)
4. **The Merge/ Proof of Stake will not reduce fees on mainnet**. Smaller block/ slot times do increase available blockspace, but not significantly. Av. blockspace is only one input which influences fees, the other being demand. Near-term scaling & lower fees will be on Layer 2s!
5. To any stakers: you should start running a local execution layer (EL) client ahead of the Merge. In the future, outsourcing this to third-party providers will open up stakers to slashing risk under the [Proof of Custody game](https://dankradfeist.de/ethereum/2021/09/30/proofs-of-custody.html)
6. The Merge will use accumulated difficulty (Total Terminal Difficulty) to trigger the PoW→PoS upgrade, instead of block height ""An attacker cld use a minority of hash power to build a malicious chain fork that wld satisfy the block height req"". more [here](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-3675#terminal-total-difficulty-vs-block-number)
7. At the Merge, the 2 ETH PoW block reward goes away. new issuance will only come from PoS validators proposing blocks (\~.025 ETH) or ""attesting"" aka voting on network state (\~.00002 ETH)  4.3% PoW issuance → .43% in PoS h/t [@litocoen](https://twitter.com/litocoen). Higher security w/ lower spend!
8. Running a node post-Merge does not require any ETH (and never has). This is an important part of Ethereum culture that should be accessible to all. (Staking independently - aka consensus activities - does require 32 ETH. With some providers, it may be lower than 32.",437.0,2022-03-31 15:31:17,0.96

There is a report that crypto assets ""shall be subject to minimum environmental sustainability standards with respect to their consensus mechanism used for validating transactions, before being issued, offered or admitted to trading in the Union."" Obviously this would be a massive problem for proof-of-work chains. This is a new attempt to include such language after a previous provision had been removed.

56. Here’s some analysis of the EU MiCA draft language guessing that there’s a good chance it will pass today (March 14) but that it might be removed during “Trilogues” which will be the subsequent informal tripartite meetings on legislative proposals between representatives of the European Parliament, the Council of the EU, and the European Commission.

55. The EU’s Markets in Crypto Assets (MiCA) draft legislative framework which may limit proof-of-work crypto assets is up for a vote today (March 14). There is a report that crypto assets ""shall be subject to minimum environmental sustainability standards with respect to their consensus mechanism used for validating transactions, before being issued, offered or admitted to trading in the Union."" Obviously this would be a massive problem for proof-of-work chains. This is a new attempt to include such language after a previous provision had been removed.

What is your level of knowledge? I made different levels so you can know it,"To what extent do you control the different terms of the crypto space? I have listed many of the ones that are commonly used. Depending on how many you know you will be in one tier or another.

The tiers are made based on concepts complexity and the frequency they're used. Of course, **take this as a game**. On the last levels there is a limit because I could've added up to hundreds of terms

There will be several that you will surely not know, so you already have homework to do hehehe

##Level 1: 
Most basic ones, if you're here you should understand them 


-Bitcoin

-Blockchain

-Ethereum

-Altcoin

-Stablecoin

-Memecoin/Shitcoin

-Wallet

-Ledger


##Level 2:
Once you start to go deeper you face this terms. Not hard to understand


-Smart contract

-Gas

-dApp

-IDO

-CEX

-DEX

-Layer 1

-Consensus mechanisms

-PoW

-PoS

-Miner

-Block


##Level 3:
This is where most people end up. Some are starting to get complicated


-NFT

-DeFi

-Metaverse

-Scalability

-Trilemma

-Layer 2

-AMM

-Liquidity pool

-ENS

-Web 3.0

-Governance

-DAO

-Flash loan

-Algorithmic stablecoin

-Halving

-Lending/Borrowing

-Liquid staking

-Interoperability

-Oracle

-Yield farming

-Node


##Level 4:
You must have studied and researched well if you know and understand these. Complex ones

-UTXO

-DAG

-Protocol owned liquidity

-EVM

-SHA256

-Mempool

-Miner pools

-The merge

-Sidechain

-Selfish mining

-ZK proofs

-ZK rollups

-Arbitrage

-Optimistic rollups

-Data availability proofs

-Generalized frontrunners

-Beacon chain

-Hashing

-Schnorr signatures

-Threshold signature

-PoET


##Level 5:
Very hard. Id say it's up to expert level


-Keepers

-MEV

-Sharding

-Merkle trees

-Plasma

-Segregated witness

-Succinct Atomic Swap

-Merkelized Abstract Syntax Trees

-Stateless Ethereum

Osmosis' first step to an all-permissionless AMM: beta.osmosis.zone,"Hey Osmonauts!

I was reading the Updates from the Lab from Mar. 23 that featured ION DAO.

**beta.osmosis.zone**

Sunny introduced a new feature/website called beta.osmosis.zone. He notes that this is a new way to bring in new assets into Osmosis without permission, while also merging the assets into Osmosis.

\- Sunny says that the reason for this Osmosis BETA is because it is an easier way to bring in canonical bridged assets from other sovereign blockchains into Osmosis. Ethereum ERC-20 tokens and other tokens from other chains can be added into the Osmosis BETA without permission.

\- He also notes that CW-20 tokens are so much easier to mint and create. Meaning projects and tokens can be very vulnerable to scams and rug pulls.

The only way that bridged asset or that CW-20 token is brought to [app.osmosis.zone](https://app.osmosis.zone) (the Main AMM) is that governance will vote if that token is worthy for pool incentivization. Which, in my opinion, is smart because it will spur up great conversations and discussions upon assets and their projects.

Osmosis also plans to create token lists that will create discoverability between assets amongst the DEX. A great example of Token Lists are on Uniswap. This will also help discover pools on Beta too.

Pools on the Osmosis BETA will be created and will be labeled on the Osmosis BETA but won't be fully labeled on the main site ([app.osmosis.zone](https://app.osmosis.zone)).

**Personal Opinion on Osmosis BETA**

With CW-20 tokens being super easy to create, it is easier to create a rug pull/scam. A great way to prevent scams/rugs to enter the Osmosis DEX, having the Osmosis BETA AMM will help discover tokens without being fully withdrawn from the DEXs. And the only way being reliable, will be through governance, creating more time to discuss and research the tokens.

Having bridged assets on Osmosis is awesome and what a great way to introduce the token derivatives from one bridge to Osmosis is to merge them into the Osmosis BETA AMM, and being added to the main site once incentivized via governance.

Although, if Osmosis can separate the token derivatives from JUNO, ETH and other chains into sections in the Osmosis BETA. It will help organize the tokens and make it easier to swap, pool and more.

I am astounded and exhilarated for what is to come for Osmosis. IONic and ION DAO will create more ION utility and staking for economic incentive, and much much more coming into Osmosis.",25.0,2022-03-26 13:02:13,0.94

They report that “\[w\]hen the time is right, we will merge both worlds together!” As to liquidity pools on their currently existing DEX, the release says “this also allows us to test liquidity pools, which we plan on adding to our Cardano mainnet DEX in the middle of 2022.” [https://medium.com/@muesliswap/muesliswap-is-releasing-an-amm-dex-on-milkomeda-sidechain-cc505438dce2](https://medium.com/@muesliswap/muesliswap-is-releasing-an-amm-dex-on-milkomeda-sidechain-cc505438dce2)

55. The EU’s Markets in Crypto Assets (MiCA) draft legislative framework which may limit proof-of-work crypto assets is up for a vote today (March 14).

A beginners Guide to Cryptocurrency," **What is a blockchain?**

It is an “immutable ledger.” Think about it like a book that lives in the sky. Every time something changes, its written down with magic ink, that when dries, never changes. And there are thousands of copies of these books, all getting updated at the same time. If one is ever messed with, the other books would wipe out the problem and replace it with the correct entry.

(Tedtalk – Blockchain Massively simplified)

**What is proof of Work?**

First generation crypto currency worked of the concept of Poof of work. There, it is a race to solve a complicated math puzzle, and perform the block write operation. And as a reward get coin. “Mining.” Mining is slow. Bitcoin can only do 7 transactions a minute.

Of the thousands and thousands of machines out there racing to win the next block, only 1 at a time wins. That means the others have literally wasted their energy via compute CPU and GPU cycles. Bitcoin used more energy than Argentina last year.  
But its not all bad. POW is still the oldest and most battle tested consensus algorithm, and many ague more secure because of it.

[https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-56012952](https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-56012952)

**What is proof of Stake?**

Proof of Stake works on different types of newly developed “Consensus” algorithms. Ouroboros protocol, created by IHOK and Cardano, along with a team of PHDs and mathematicians, is the first of its kind. They created a secure “lottery” consensus mechanism to “elect” the next “slot leader” to write the block. Here each Stake pool can get a chance to be elected by winning the lottery. Each Ada coin represents 1 lottery ticket. When you delegate to the pool, you give that pool your ticket, not your coin. If the pool wins, you get the reward along with everyone in the pool, and the operator. Because there is no more complicated math puzzle, and no more computers racing to solve the puzzle, its much much faster, and much much cheaper. Cardano nodes can be run on Raspberry Pi.. A lot of nodes out there run on Solar energy. It’s so good, Ethereum, who is proof of work currently, is moving to this model as part of their ETH 2.0 migration. Hopefully this summer with the ""merge."" In efforts to reduce gas fees and energy concerns. Pokodot created its own Consensus algorithm. Called Grandpa. Tezos has its Emmy+, and the list goes on.

Each other their own way of doing things. But “gen 3” is not Proof of work.

What you should remember is that for both POW, POS, and others, they are all a means of incentivizing the actual people that run the computers hosting the blockchain code. Without them, there is no “decentralized network of immutable ledgers.” Which is because that’s just fancy talk for machines running our code to support the blockchain.

**What is Market Cap and coin supply and why should we care?**

Market Capitalization is equal to Price of Coin times Supply of Coin. That is, it. But very important.

BITCOIN has a fixed supply. It is not all mined yet. Not until 2140. But it does have a finite amount, 21 Million.

Here is why you can see a 65K or even 100K bitcoin, but you’ll probably never see a 100 dollar DOGE, or even a 30 Dollar Ada (not soon anyway)

Currently there are 18,992,543 BTC out there at a cost of 43,837.39.

That means, the market cap is 43,837.39 x 18,992,543 = 832,583,514,582.77 (832B)

Cardano, has a fixed coin supply as well. But it is 45 Billion. There are currently 33,713,300,598. So you see the max is 2500x more. Likewise, with 130B DOGE vs 18M BTC - it’s \~6700X more. DogeCoin also makes 10,000 new coins a minute.

At a price is 1.17 that means the market cap for Cardano is 1.27 X 33,713,300,598 = 39,444,561,699.66 (39B)

You’ll need 136B market cap to reach a 1-dollar DOGE in the next year.

132,670,764,300 + ((10,000\*60\*24\*351) = 137,725,164,300 (Supply of DOGE in 1 year from now)  
137,725,164,300 \* 1 = 137,725,164,300

You'll need an almost 1 Trillion Market Cap for Cardano to hit 3032,127,627,594 \* 30 = 963,828,827,820

To give you some reference. Here is the Market cap of some big names.

Visa – 499B

Adobe – 250B

Amazon – 1.7T

It’s very confusing because every coin has their own supply. Their own way of creating coins and at what cadence. Some even “burn” coins. So, know what yours does and how it works.

**How can I “get in early?”**

First. We are all early. You might not have gotten in on the first floor, but we’re only halfway up the stairs to the second flight.

Global wealth is estimated at 1 quadrillion. All the Market Cap in crypto is at 2.05 Trillion. That’s only 0.21% of the world’s wealth.

When looking for “what could be the next big thing” find something with a low market cap, regardless of coin price, that has a strong chance of doing well because of team and tech, the two Ts.

Also ask yourself.

What are these coins use cases?

Who is their target audience for adoption?

Who is funding them?

Who is their team building it? What is their history?

Do they have a good plan?

[https://river.com/learn/how-much-worlds-money-in-bitcoin/#:\~:text=Global%20wealth%20is%20estimated%20at,represents%200.09%25%20of%20global%20wealth](https://river.com/learn/how-much-worlds-money-in-bitcoin/#:~:text=Global%20wealth%20is%20estimated%20at,represents%200.09%25%20of%20global%20wealth).

**What are your goals?**

Crypto is really split into 4 worlds.

Day traders, H.O.D.L.’ers, Whales, and weak hands.

Day traders realize that this market is very volatile, now, and historically. Good ones, can capitalize on quick gains by buying low and selling high, waiting for a dip, then buying back in, and selling high again, cyclically.

Then there are those that “Hold On for Dear Life.” These people tend to find something they really are passionate about, and never sell. They keep buying. If they see their coin dips, below at what they bought it at, and have some extra funds, they buy more, to ""Average Down."" Or Dollar cost average (DCA) by buying a set amount on a regular cadence. They only “take profit” buy selling a small portion when price is really high.

Whales, are investors that come in with millions and billions of dollars. They often “test” the market buy either buying or dumping millions and billions in hopes to manipulate the market to their advantage. If you’re reading this, you’re probably not in this category, but you should know they exist and effect this marketplace.

Then there are “weak hands.” Do not pick this one. These people buy high and sell low. They only invest based on emotion, and nothing else. When things start going bad, they panic, and sell at a loss. Its much better to let your coin go to .000000001 cents, and just hold on to it in the hopes of a rally years later, then it is to ever sell at a loss. Never do this. Never.

Each has its own risks and rewards.

Day trading can rack up dollars quick, but you can lose them just as quick. And there are tax implicates with trades. Some unknown, and constantly changing.

HODL, might take years, but if you do, the chance of your Return on Invest improves significantly in crypto.

Pick what works best for you but have a plan.

**What are things to look out for?**

**Do your own research**. There are now more then 4K types of crypto currencies. You can create your own in about 30 minutes with the right free tools.

The mortality rate of new coins is super high this year. Lots of people trying to do Pump and Dumps.

There is nothing in life that goes up for no reason, if it does, it’s a Ponzi scheme.

**What is the difference between storing on an exchange or in a wallet?**

A lot.

First, you must remember what the dream of crypto is really offering.

Its offering a way for us to break away from banks. Forever.

Centralized banks that can print money, is a problem. Blockchain solves this.

But not if the new bank ends up being Binace or Coinbase. In fact, keeping your coin in exchanges puts us all at risk of market manipulation by them.

When a certain 1 person or group owns too many nodes, they can make choices that would benefit them. The attack vector is called a 51% attack or sybil attack.

Today however, you need exchanges to on ramp and off ramp FIAT. FIAT money is government-issued currency that is not backed by a physical commodity, such as gold or silver.

But it will not be like that forever. Chains like ADA and DOT will be interoperable with legacy banks and will eventually cut out exchanges.

Personally, I despise BNB coin and binace. They already take high fees, and now they want the control and the rewards too. Coinbase isn’t much better. Again though, a necessary evil, for now.

But more important than the “dream” is that they can be hacked.

They are a website. Not a blockchain. They hold the keys to your wallet, and let you use them with a weak password and no mfa if you like. Its literally like storing your money in a bank. So know your bank. Good thing, like a bank, SOME, are federally insured up to a certain amount. But some are not, and people have lost millions and billions in the past this way.

Lastly, there is the notification of “passive income” and “interest.”

With POS systems, delegators are incentivized to “stake” their coin by earning interest.

With POW systems, like bitcoin, you’d have to stand up your own machine, configure it, and let it use your energy in your house. With withs like Cardano Ada, and ETH 2.0, you can now pull your coin off the exchange, put it in a wallet, delegate to a pool, and earn interest. All while maintaining full control of your coins.

**What are Smart Contracts? (This one will blow your mind if you are a developer)**

First let us start with what most people say.

“Smart contracts are self-executing contracts with the terms of the agreement between buyer and seller being directly written into lines of code.”

Which is true for sure. It helps build trust and removes the cumbersome third party “trusted agent” like a bank.

But what smart contracts really are is “ANY Code” that can be written to a blockchain and NEVER be changed, forever.

ANY CODE. You can write your own coins and put them into the block. It happens a lot.

Games, sure, put in the chain. Check out CryptoKitties.

In the future ALL business will be blockchain businesses. Every transaction, every process in the building and distribution, will be written to a magic book that can’t be messed with.. Ever..

**What are NFTs?**

NonFungible Tokens is metadata attached to an asset.

The metadata is things like who created it, and when. Along with the most important piece the link to the asset.

The asset is what most people think of when they talk about NFTs.  
Its a digital file. Like a jpg or a mov file.  
But its not stored in the blockchain like most assume.  
Instead they are stored, most often, in IPFS storage.  
IPFS is very cool, but its not blockchain, and thus not ""immutable.""

So what’s the big deal? I can upload a gif to the internet today.

The big deal is twofold.

First, you are not uploading anything to the “internet.” That whole thing we call the internet is flawed. Tracked, centralized, monitored, and gated.

What you are doing is creating an EARLY entry, in a book that will never change for the rest of time.

Let us sit and think about that for a second.

De Beers is going to have to get new slogan. “A ~~diamond~~ NFT is forever”

Right now, it is some awful GIF of a dogecoin. But it is not what it is. It is what it represents.

It is the next chapter in Art history. What is created will last longer than the Mona Lisa. Someday you will have blockchain archaeologist that comb though chains.

Plus, taking away the cool factor, they create a place that you can now prove you did it first.

Artist could upload lyrics as an NFT, and later sell them, without the fear their art might be stolen before a contract is in place. People could attach their house deed to a chain, and ever again dispute who owns the land after a conflict.

Besides gaming, NFTs are frequently used to sell a wide range of virtual collectibles, including NBA virtual trading cards, music, digital images, video clips and even virtual real estate in [Decentraland](https://decentraland.org/), a virtual world.

That of course is the rosier outlook on NFTs.

Unfortunately, in practice there are many gaps today.

The first I already mentioned. The asset is not stored in the blockchain.  
What that means is that the IPFS provider could ""unpin"" your asset, and if its not saved anywhere else, you'll end up with an NFT that has metadata that points to a url that has nothing there.

The second problem, is that there are thousands of blockchains. People can take your asset, because its publicly pined, and then go create an NFT on another blockchain, and then claim theirs is in fact the original. You'd have to check every chain that supports NFTs to ensure it was in fact the first first.

Or people have taken hard artwork, like paintings, and then minted and sold them as NFTs.

55. The EU’s Markets in Crypto Assets (MiCA) draft legislative framework which may limit proof-of-work crypto assets is up for a vote today (March 14). There is a report that crypto assets ""shall be subject to minimum environmental sustainability standards with respect to their consensus mechanism used for validating transactions, before being issued, offered or admitted to trading in the Union."" Obviously this would be a massive problem for proof-of-work chains. This is a new attempt to include such language after a previous provision had been removed.

56. Here’s some analysis of the EU MiCA draft language guessing that there’s a good chance it will pass today (March 14) but that it might be removed during “Trilogues” which will be the subsequent informal tripartite meetings on legislative proposals between representatives of the European Parliament, the Council of the EU, and the European Commission.

The relative capacities of Cardano and Ethereum to handle the ever-increasing complexity demanded of Gen 3 blockchains appear to be diverging with an Ethereum Core Developer dropping a long thread concluding that “If the protocol \[Ethereum\] doesn't get slimmer, it's not going to make it.” Meanwhile, Haskell developers are happy to explain how the compositionality of Cardano’s chosen programming language is perfect to accommodate complexity.

Decentralised Assignment: 500 word rational on why Algorand is revolutionary.,"There are a lot of reasons why I see Algorand as revolutionary. 

But I've only been an investor for a little while and haven't gone super deep. And I'm still pretty green when it comes to blockchain though I see clearly a paradigm shift is underfoot. 

I thought it would be cool to reach out and asked you all what makes Algorand special in your minds. I will reference this conversation and credit the hivemind in my assignment. I think there is huge value in collective research and want to demonstrate that. Community is a revolutionary aspect often overlooked when comparing nodes, TPS and block heights. In my mind it does seem to be the reason why Bitcoin continues to be the polluting store of value it has become. 

I'm writing a short assignment that needs to be concise and cover these questions. Tell me what you see as the stand out attributes of Algorand? What sets it apart from others? 

1. Why did you choose this participant to focus on?   
2. How is it disrupting or revolutionising its sector?   
3. What are the opportunities for this participant in the cryptofinance ecosystem?   
4. What risks and challenges does this participant face? 

If you choose to participate, thanks in advance!

&#x200B;

Here are some of my thoughts so far:

**1. Why did you choose this participant to focus on?** 

Algorand is forging a path forward into a decentralised, borderless, regenerative economy.

Algorand is the world greenest blockchain, has solved the scalability trilemma. It is one of the fastest, most secure and scalable smart contract platforms to build the Web3 future on. The Algorand Virtual Machine (AVM) runs on every node across the Algorand blockchain. 

The Algorand community are devoted to the Algorand protocol. The Algorand reddit group is thriving with 65.8 thousand active members conversing everyday about developments within the ecosystem. 

Alogrand is what Ethereum hopes to become - scalable, secure and decentralised. Algorand's consensus mechainsm is Proof of Stake, which is why it is so energy efficient. 

Algorand was designed to be a highly energy efficient network from day one. They are partnering with organisations with sustainable use cases, while off setting their minimal carbon footprint. 

Algorands transaction speeds match that of major financial networks such as Visa or Mastercard. Algorand execute with immediate finality with zero uncertainty. 

  
**2. How is it disrupting or revolutionising its sector?** 

Like other blockchain protocol Algorand promises to revolutionise the way in which we transact, broker agreements, make decisions, govern the collective. And Algorand tested and ready to be deployed as scale. 

Algorands block proposal mechanism  randomly, secretively and continuously select new delegates to participate in the consensus protocol. With each block Algorand reveals a new unpredictable selection seed to determine the next round of block selection. 

  
**3. What are the opportunities for this participant in the cryptofinance ecosystem?** 

Algorand has proven itself to be an incredible technological achievement. It's focus on sustainability will set an example of what blockchain can become. 

  
**4. What risks and challenges does this participant face?** 

Algorand, like other layer 1 protocols face the challenge Ethereum dominance. Will Ethereum become the single blockchain in the future, or will protocols eventually merge into a mesh of decentralised networks, with full fluid interoperability across networks.

55. The EU’s Markets in Crypto Assets (MiCA) draft legislative framework which may limit proof-of-work crypto assets is up for a vote today (March 14). There is a report that crypto assets ""shall be subject to minimum environmental sustainability standards with respect to their consensus mechanism used for validating transactions, before being issued, offered or admitted to trading in the Union.""

ETH complexity problem and XMR,"There was a post at /cc subreddit about a ETH dev that said that the increasing complexity of ETH is becoming a problem. For some reason I can’t cross post in here, so I’ll just copy the text.

Lead ETH dev makes ""ominous"" thread about Ethereum. Not sure what to make of it...but it doesn't sound good. Any useful insights on this?

Complexity is an often overlooked aspect of a system because usually someone else is paying the price for it, not the person creating it.

But don't be mistaken, someone *is* paying the price - whether money, time or mental capacity. They might not be willing/able to do forever.  

As with scalability, complexity also keeps trickling unseen up to the breaking point. At that time, it's already past the point of no return.

Complexity also has the nasty effect of causing cascading failures. Overload people too much, lose capacity, leading to even larger load.  

In #Ethereum's history, complexity never decreased. Every EIP is piling on top. Every major change (1559, merge, sharding, verkle, stateless, L2, etc) is one more nail.

I'm extremely frustrated when a research proposal says ""everything's figured out, it's just engineering now"".  

As good as it feels that we're approaching The Merge, I must emphasize that #Ethereum is not going in a clean direction. Tangentially it's achieving results, but it's also piling complexity like there's no tomorrow.

If the protocol doesn't get slimmer, it's not going to make it.  

I feel the root cause is the disconnect between the research and the dev teams. The former has to ""only"" dream up elegant - standalone - ideas.

The latter needs to juggle every single idea that was ever introduced, whilst surgically expanding the dimensionality of the space.  

There have been engineering attempts to reduce the complexity (module split in Erigon, responsibility split in The Merge). Yet there was never an attempt to reduce the protocol complexity.  

We are already past the point of anyone having a full picture of the system. This is bad.  

I can't say what the solution is, but my 2c is to stop adding features and start culling, even at the expense of breaking things.

There are less and less people knowing and willing to piece together a broken network. And each change pushes more away. /FIN

What I want to ask is: from my understanding, XMR wouldn’t have this problem because it has only one function: a private currency. But I don’t have enough knowledge to be able to answer this question. Anyone smarter than me can give their insights ? Thanks!",87.0,2022-03-22 12:47:46,0.94

"Lead ETH dev makes ""ominous"" thread about Ethereum. Complexity has increased the surface area for fatal bugs and the complexity has reached a breaking point. Simple scaling Crypto like BCH is actually the correct path into the future.","Péter Szilágyi (karalabe.eth) @peter_szilagyi Mar 18

Complexity is an often overlooked aspect of a system because usually someone else is paying the price for it, not the person creating it.

But don't be mistaken, someone is paying the price - whether money, time or mental capacity. They might not be willing/able to do forever.

As with scalability, complexity also keeps trickling unseen up to the breaking point. At that time, it's already past the point of no return.

Complexity also has the nasty effect of causing cascading failures. Overload people too much, lose capacity, leading to even larger load.

In #Ethereum's history, complexity never decreased. Every EIP is piling on top. Every major change (1559, merge, sharding, verkle, stateless, L2, etc) is one more nail.

I'm extremely frustrated when a research proposal says ""everything's figured out, it's just engineering now"".

As good as it feels that we're approaching The Merge, I must emphasize that #Ethereum is not going in a clean direction. Tangentially it's achieving results, but it's also piling complexity like there's no tomorrow.

If the protocol doesn't get slimmer, it's not going to make it.

I feel the root cause is the disconnect between the research and the dev teams. The former has to ""only"" dream up elegant - standalone - ideas.

The latter needs to juggle every single idea that was ever introduced, whilst surgically expanding the dimensionality of the space.

There have been engineering attempts to reduce the complexity (module split in Erigon, responsibility split in The Merge). Yet there was never an attempt to reduce the protocol complexity.

We are already past the point of anyone having a full picture of the system. This is bad.

I can't say what the solution is, but my 2c is to stop adding features and start culling, even at the expense of breaking things.

There are less and less people knowing and willing to piece together a broken network. And each change pushes more away. /FIN

"FLUX - RVN - ERGO - FIRO - ETC ; How does the ""Tech"" / ""Use-case"" / ""Community"" / ""Project"" / ""Development"" compare ?","Hi everyone. With ETH merge becoming more and more ""likely to happen soon"" as the days go by, a lot of attention is going towards other GPU-minable PoW cryptocurrencies. There are a lot of them out there, but I guess the biggest 5 that are out for the ""hash-race"" are Flux, Ravencoin, Ergo, Firo, and Ethereum Classic.

Here I am NOT asking which coin would be most profitable to mine after the merge, or if you think X coin could support all the hash, price predictions, and all the common interrogations we often see on the subject. 

I am asking your honest opinion on those projects, essentially regarding the technology behind them and their concrete use-case in the real world, but also about the team, the development, the community, and how you see the project as a whole and its place in the future.

I am asking for myself, but also asking for others ; because I think that that ""kind of comparaison"" between coins isn't really common to be seen. Other coins / project than those 5 are also welcomed to this discussion.

Stuff /r/ethereum should know: Proof of Stake edition,"Poorly informed crypto-journalist articles are constantly coming out, and this brings more Proof-of-Stake related questions and discussions rehashing the same topics and same misconceptions. So here are a bunch of common questions/takes I see, boiled down in quick bullet points like I did in [my previous post](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/s8mnwb/a_collection_of_various_things_the_average/) that was more about Ethereum in general.

I plan on lazily linking this thread whenever I see those points being brought up, and I encourage everyone to do the same and correct me if I got anything wrong or suggest any addition.

## Wat merge?

A lot more info can be found on [ethmerge.com](https://ethmerge.com/) so I will keep this section light

* When the merge happens, Ethereum will be secured by Proof of Stake instead of Proof of Work.

* The Merge is not ""ETH 2.0"", there is no ETH 2.0, [it's an obsolete term.](https://blog.ethereum.org/2022/01/24/the-great-eth2-renaming/)

* **If you currently hold ETH, you don't need to do anything.** You will still hold the same amount of ETH after the merge, there is no ""ETH2 coin"", no need to migrate anything, etc. Everything sames exactly the same, only the consensus mechanism changes under the hood.

* It's called ""merge"" because it's about *merging* the Beacon Chain (*consensus layer*) with the current chain (*execution layer*) and ditching the proof of work part of the execution layer.

* If you don't know, ""consensus"" is just a fancy word for the goal of ordering transactions and getting some economic guarantee that this order won't change. Both PoW and PoS achieve consensus by different means:

  * PoW: ""It costs too much to mess up with the order of blocks, playing by the rules is more lucrative.""

  * PoS: ""It costs too much to mess up with the order of blocks, because if I do I'll lose all the money I put up as collateral.""

* Since it's only the consensus mechanism changing, **Proof of Stake by itself will not lower gas fees significantly**.

## Why merge?

* Lower security costs since there's less energy needed to achieve consensus.

  * For PoW you need miners to be able to *at least* cover all the hardware and energy they use otherwise no one will mine. This requires a big issuance that is quickly sold for fiat to pay the bills.
  
  * For PoS you just need to give some yield to stakers to make people want to deposit capital rather than just invest it elsewhere. No big bills to pay beyond an ordinary computer and an internet connection, so the yield just has to reflect the opportunity costs and risks involved.

* More sustainability:

  * The security of a blockchain is basically proportional to the value of its coin. This is true for both PoW (more valuable coin rewards = more reasons to play by the rules = more miners = harder to mess up the consensus) and PoS (more valuable staked coins = more reasons to play by the rules to avoid losing the staked coins)

  * A newly issued coin is essentially value being taken from all holders of the coin and being redistributed to someone. All else equal, selling that coin for fiat extracts value out of the network.

* It opens the door for many scaling solutions in the future, namely data sharding, statelessness, light clients, and [more](https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin/status/1466411377107558402)

* It helps reduce some complexity of the code going forward, by separating concerns between execution and consensus.

* Appeasing the environment and gamers is certainly a nice side-effect, but not really a major reason behind the switch to PoS, since it's mostly about externalities over which Ethereum as a protocol doesn't have much control (source of energy production, GPU supply chains, etc.)

## Wen merge?

* It happened on September 15th, 2022

## Nope, your a idiot. They will delay it like they always have in the past. They promised it years ago and still haven't delivered.

Believe or not this was a common talking point before the merge

## Those millions of ETH staked will crash the price the very moment they're unlocked LOL

For sure, there will be plenty of stakers who will want to finally take profit, especially those who locked their ETH back when 32 ETH was worth $10k. But there's plenty more to consider on the other side of the equation:

* The merge doesn't unlock any ETH. Withdrawals will come in the first hard fork following the merge, likely 6-8 months after. That's months of no proof of work issuance (~13k ETH/day) being sold off *and* no proof of stake issuance coming into circulation.

* Just like how there's a queue to deposit ETH, there will be [a queue to withdraw it.](https://github.com/ethereum/annotated-spec/blob/master/phase0/beacon-chain.md#how-does-eth2-proof-of-stake-work). Assuming a mass sell-off event, everyone is in that queue, limited at a rate of 1125 valitors per day. So there's no ""opening the floodgates"" moment. Everyone unstaking would literally take over a year. A year of ~38k ETH/day entering back into circulation (or... roughly 1% of average daily volume)

* After the merge, validators will start receiving fee rewards as well, doubling the yield [by some estimates](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1vrK5sY5ooq-F8dcyRhmmAJ5YtgkvWKWP3OfGCZIYxSA/edit#gid=0). There are thousands of people waiting in line to stake *right now*. They're okay with a 5% yield on their ETH, I don't think they're gonna yeet the moment it becomes 10% lol

* The biggest risk involved in staking is *by far* the merge. Something catastrophic could go wrong, yet people have been staking and locking up their ETH for over a year despite this risk and despite the ETH being locked until an unknown floating date. How many people/institutions are waiting on the sidelines for this risk to disappear before jumping in?

* And don't forget stakers exiting means fewer validators which means higher rewards for the stakers who don't exit. It also means more incentives for other people to *start* staking if they weren't before...

* But of course it's crypto, and crypto's gonna crypto. The merge will bring excitement and volatility and possibly a sell-the-news dip, who knows. I don't pretend to know the future, but the way I see it it's much more likely way more ETH will flow *into* staking than out of it.

## If proof of stake is so good, then how come Ethereum didn't go with that from the start?

* Proof of Work is easy to conceptualize and implement, Proof of Stake isn't. Especially when back in 2014 it was mostly a theoretical concept still being researched, with some blockchain implementing some version of it.

* There were several fundamental problems with PoS that needed to be overcome from a research perspective before thinking about implementing it. 

* There is no one-size-fits-all for Proof of Stake. Every PoS blockchain comes with its own PoS specification that has pros and cons on various aspects, so it's not as simple as ""but this other blockchain did it, why can't ethereum just do the same thing""

* Starting as a proof of work chain had the benefit of letting anyone mine coins on their own without anyone's permission, which helped the coin distribution become way better than those newer chains that are proof of stake from the start and have to decide how to allocate the initial coins, which can't really be done permissionlessly.

* Related to above: Yes, there was still a premine/presale for Ethereum, but it has now been diluted to half the supply after years of mining and multiple bull/bear cycles making that ETH swap hands, bringing the distribution [closer to Bitcoin's](https://medium.com/@adamscochran/the-10k-audit-42c100dd32bb). So it's not that big of a deal in 2022 when Ether as an asset is extremely liquid and easy to acquire. 

## Nah, this is really just a ploy to screw over the miners one last time after years of hard work

* PoS has been the eventual goal since [day 1](https://blog.ethereum.org/2014/07/22/launching-the-ether-sale/), everyone mining was always aware that it would end one day. There is no rugpull or unfairness going on here.

* Economic factors trump any kind of miner-blockchain loyalty. You can kinda view the blockchain as a business and the miners as employees:

  * Miners/employees have been paid for the service they provide (namely, secure consensus) with the block rewards. The paycheck is an expense for the employer and it comes from diluting the value of existing coins from holders (see above in ""why merge?"")

  * Miners go to the chain offering the highest rewards, most of them would ditch Ethereum in a heartbeat if another GPU minable coin gave out more rewards. 

  * Similarly, Ethereum will pay less for the service it requires if stakers can do it for way cheaper. 

* It's not entirely exclusive. Miners can also be holders of the coin, and users of the blockchain. Nothing prevents them from holding their rewards and becoming stakers too.

## The coin stops having inherent value if you're not spending real world energy to mine it

I don't really buy this argument. There is nothing magical about computing hashes over and over until you land on one that fits arbitrary requirements. I mean, you could have a proof of work blockchain where the work is done by solving sudoku puzzles and it would work exactly the same: NP-complete problem, hard to compute one way but easy to verify a solution once one has been found. That doesn't mean solving sudoku inherently brings value into the world. Cranking up the mining difficulty of a coin doesn't magically make everyone richer, it just makes mining less profitable – unless of course demand goes up too, which so far hasn't been too much of a problem in the crypto world.

The way I see it, the value of a coin ultimately comes from supply and demand, and the demand comes from how valuable the blockspace is. People need ETH to buy the blockspace, regardless of whether that ETH is generated by a miner or a staker. Sure, the more miners there are the higher the security/decentralization which further increases the value proposition of the blockspace in a positive feedback loop, but [feedback loops exist in Proof of Stake Ethereum too](https://i.imgur.com/3bPV35a.png) and they're super cool too!

## Proof of Stake is a recipe for total centralization

* It's basically the same as Proof of Work but slightly different. ""Better"" or ""worse"" really depends on your opinion. The way I see it, PoW is really just PoS with extra steps.

* Ethereum as a community values decentralization highly, any potential centralization vector is addressed by the research team to come up with ways to mitigate it, even if it's at the cost of other important stuff like scaling (e.g. keeping gas limits low so more nodes can participate in decentralization, even if that results in congestion and high fees)

* There **are** shortcomings currently, decentralization is a spectrum and a process and we're not there yet, and for the time being there are many centralization crutches that need to go away on the long term. That said, none of these crutches represent existential risks for the network, and for practically any ""it's centralized because X"" statement, there is an item on [the roadmap](https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin/status/1466411377107558402) addressing X. I personally find it much more fascinating to come up with a whole bunch of stuff to solve X rather than give up and say ""it can't be done because of X"". 

* Something interesting about Ethereum's PoS design that is often overlooked: Quadratic penalties. A single validator going down, messing up, or downright attacking the network doesn't get penalized very badly. A thousand validators doing it at the same time get penalized much more heavily. 

  * This means that if you're a megawhale with thousands of validators, it's in your own best interest to spread them out, avoid cloud hosting, use different clients, etc. Sure, the capital is still concentrated, but at least the points of failures are distributed which is good for the health of the network overall.

  * Compared to a big mining operation that relies on a central location to amortize costs, which can be spotted from energy usage and shut down if the authorities don't like it. It's hard to move mining equipment across the world, but staking only relies on private/public keys and not any actual hardware beyond a consumer grade computer.

## PoS is really just ""who has money makes more money""

* Yes. Unfortunately we live in a world of high wealth inequality. Blockchains don't fix that. 

* It's also true of proof of work: Whoever has money can buy more mining rigs and make more money. Except with mining, the ROI becomes better with economies of scale: Centralized mining operations have the big bucks to get bulk/discount rates on hardware and move to the places with cheap electricity. The solo miner simply can't realistically compete. With Proof of Stake, everyone earns the same yield proportionally, where they stake $10 or $10M.

* ""*They may be centralized, but those big mining operations have no reason to attack the network and weaken it since they dumped millions in infrastructure*""....... so you're saying you're fine with big centralized actors existing, as long as they have some kind of a big *stake* in the network?

## Passive interest on your deposit though? Printing money out of thin air? That's literally central banks and fiat part 2 electric boogaloo

* You have to really stretch it to make this case, but I've seen people do that lol. Those takes usually begin with ""proof of stake is nothing new""

* There's still ""work"" being done by validators: creating blocks and validating other blocks. It's just that the work done is composed entirely of the *actually useful work* that the blockchain needs to reach consensus, instead of computing hashes over and over again until one of them meets an arbitrary requirement. 

* It's not really ""free money being printed out of thin air"", there are still costs involved in staking capital, they're just more abstract and less direct than energy bills:

  * Opportunity costs – Why stake at all if another investment offers you a better yield?

  * Illiquidity – From the moment you deposit, your capital is locked up, queued up until your validator is active, then when you withdraw there is yet another queue before getting it back.

  * Inherent risks – It's still a fairly new thing, something could go wrong, there could be a critical bug, network could get attacked, your staking hardware could get compromised, etc.

  * Volatility – at the end of the day it's still a volatile asset, if you're the kind of investor who denominates their investments in their country's fiat currency, then a 5% yield on an asset that can drop 30% overnight isn't all that great (the upside of 5% yield on an asset that doubles is pretty great though, turn that 100% gain into 110%)

  * Maintenance – You still have to maintain and secure your validator, ensure 100% uptime, update software, etc. 

* Here's where it gets nifty: The more stakers there are, the lower the individual rewards get. This basically means that all those costs above will get priced by the market itself. It's easy to see why: If the staking yield is too low, then the rewards don't justify the costs and people will pull out and invest elsewhere, bringing the yield back up. Likewise if it's too high, that'll attract more capital and bring it back down. 

* As far as inflation goes: Let's say the market as a whole decides that 5% is the ideal yield, of which 3% comes from issuance. That works out to about 30 million ETH staked printing 900 thousand new ETH per year. At a total supply of 120 million ETH, that's an inflation rate of 0.75%. Which is outpaced by EIP1559 burn as long as gas fees are at least 23 gwei. (I cannot stress this enough: *Ether-the-asset will become a yield-bearing deflationary asset very soon*)

* ""*Nice math but there's no supply cap + they change the monetary policy all the time*"" 

  * The goal has been ""minimum viable issuance to secure the network"" for years, priorizing network security over an arbitrary supply cap.
  
  * No update to the monetary policy has ever increased supply inflation. Low inflation rate (specifically *dis*inflation) has been the goal since day 1.

  * There will be an equilibrium acting as an effective supply cap – decided again by market forces valuing Ethereum's blockspace – once the rate of EIP1559 burn matches the rate of issuance. That's super nifty if you ask me.

* So yeah, there's no ""central Ethereum bank"" adjusting rates arbitrarily and printing money to cronies. The market itself dictates how much inflation/deflation there is, no single entity can control it the way a central bank controls fiat inflation rates.

## Whales have all the money needed to take over and change the rules and slash honest stakers

* No. Ethereum has no on-chain governance of any kind for this reason. Protocol updates are a community effort (*Layer 0*) and you don't need any money staked to call out bad ideas and participate in the process.

* This is exactly the same as Proof of Work: Even if you have 99% of the hashpower, you can't make invalid transactions that steal people's money without their private keys, or change protocol rules, or really do anything beyond reorganizing blocks. The 1% of honest nodes will reject any block that don't follow the rules and you'll be mining on an invalid/useless chain. Now replace hashpower/mining with stake/staking and the same holds true for Proof of Stake (with the difference that someone caught reorganizing blocks will have their entire stake destroyed, whereas the blockchain can't exactly destroy mining rigs)

* And simply put, there is a fuckton of ETH involved. 10 million and counting and that's *before the merge*. At current prices that's roughly 30 billion dollars. Both ""amount of ETH staked"" and ""value of ETH"" are projected to go up, so attacks become increasingly unlikely due to the sheer economic cost involved in doing an attack — *once* — and the absurdity of acquiring that much ETH in the first place if the attack comes from an outside actor (where would you buy 10 million ETH to have 51% of the stake? 20M?)

## 32 ETH is way too much, the average person doesn't have that much

* I agree it's a lot. There are some ideas of how it could be lowered ([better signature aggregation](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/rwojtk/ama_we_are_the_efs_research_team_pt_7_07_january/hrmt6o0/) or [a rotating cap of active validators](https://ethresear.ch/t/simplified-active-validator-cap-and-rotation-proposal/9022)) but they don't seem to be very high on the priority list currently, as opposed to making sure the base layer is truly secure.

* The reason for such a high number is it has to fall in a technical sweetspot. In a nutshell, it has to be low enough to be accessible and have enough validators to secure the chain, but high enough to not have too many validators and bloat the chain with overhead. And having a fixed amount for each validator reduces a lot of the complexity by having each validator weighted exactly the same in the distributed randomness process of who gets to produce each block.

* There is a whole bunch of [math involved](https://thomasborgers.medium.com/ethereum-2-0-economic-review-1fc4a9b8c2d9) to arrive at 32 ETH from a technical standpoint, back when 32 ETH was worth about 7000 USD. [Earlier math from 2017](https://medium.com/@VitalikButerin/parametrizing-casper-the-decentralization-finality-time-overhead-tradeoff-3f2011672735) even suggested over 1000 ETH minimum. 

* Thankfully, just like mining pools exist, there are staking pools to allow staking in smaller amounts. It doesn't necessarily fly in the face of the ""not your keys not your coins"" mantra, thanks to things like [RocketPool](https://rocketpool.net/), [Secret Shared Validators](https://medium.com/coinmonks/secret-shared-validators-on-ethereum-2-0-ea29ab380016) (not yet launched) which use smart contracts to be permissionless, decentralized and non-custodian. And because of the quadratic penalties mentioned above, I believe decentralized staking operations will outperform the centralized ones on the long run. I recommend superphiz's [guide to staking](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethstaker/comments/t1xpr5/how_to_stake_on_ethereum_march_2022_edition/) for more info. And obviously, I admit staking through exchanges is yucky if you value decentralization

* Related to above, stuff like Rocket Pool is better viewed as a higher-level abstraction to base staking, rather than ""just a staking pool"". I go into more details on this [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/tijcq1/stuff_rethereum_should_know_proof_of_stake_edition/i1gd27b/?context=1) for those interested.

## PoS hasn't been proven, while we know PoW works

That's actually totally fair and there is no real rebuttal to this, obviously. Only time will tell. I just think it's irrelevant in the context that Ethereum *is* switching to PoS and was always going to. If you don't believe in it, don't participate/invest in it. I do personally believe in a long term sustainable PoS Ethereum, but even then I'm glad good ol' boring-by-design Bitcoin will be there chugging its proof of work along.

It's all part of the great crypto experiment of our lifetime. Either it's just a fad and will fail into obscurity, which would be a bummer for sure, or we'll have succeeded in creating monster robust networks capable of outlasting humanity. To achieve that, prioritizing decentralization is key. Which is something I mainly just see in Bitcoin and Ethereum, despite the widely different philosophies. It's why I'm glad to have both to truly see what's what on the long term.

"Ethereum Staking Queue Nears All-Time High Ahead Of Mainnet Merge. ETH should return to USD$4,000+ very soon!!! GLTA!!!","Ethereum is well on its way to the Merge as more milestones are met. The move to proof-of-stake will no doubt be a game-changer for the blockchain. So as the day for the merge draws closer, users of the network have been upping their activity in recent times. One of the places where Ethereum has recorded an uptick has been the staking queue which is now nearing its previous all-time high.

Ethereum Staking Queue Crosses 300,000

The Ethereum staking queue is a good indicator of how users of the network are looking at it. When this is low, investors may be more wary and not want to stake their coins on the network. However, when this number begins to go up, it signals a number of things for Ethereum, among them, being that users are looking more positively at it.

This queue has been going up in recent times and as of 17th March, has almost reached its previous high. It had previously touched a new high above 330K in June of 2021 when the bull rally had been in full bloom. But the subsequent market downtrend had seen this number come down with it going into the bear trend. Only to begin another recovery in August of the same year.

As for 2022, the number had been steadily growing but hadn’t seen any significant boost. This boost came about two weeks into March when the number of wallets on the queue crossed 300K. It is the sharpest increase ever recorded by the Balance Validators Status.

What Does This Mean?

For a network like Ethereum, beating and setting new records aren’t a new thing. But like with any other thing, such high interest will definitely have an impact on the network and the price. In this case, the number of wallets that are now suitable to stake on the network is higher and are waiting to be activated to do so. When such a large amount of wallets are given the green light to start staking, it will take a **good chunk of coins out of current circulation**.

This is because it takes 32 ETH for a wallet to be eligible to become a validator on the network. This means that when these wallets on the queue are activated, about 1 million ETH coins will be locked away for at least three months, which is the minimum staking duration for Ethereum.

A look at past charts shows that times like this have coincided with the increase in price for ETH. However, there has been one deviation which was during the November rally where ETH hit a new high above $4,000.

Nevertheless, with such volumes of ETH being temporarily taken out of circulation, it most likely will positively affect the value of the cryptocurrency, pushing the value towards previous highs.

**Frequently Asked Questions**

**Where's the best place to buy ETH?**

There are many centralized exchanges that support Ethereum. If you live in the US, the most popular exchanges are Coinbase, Gemeni and Kraken. Coinbase users can use Coinbase Pro for lower fees.

**When is Eth2 launching?**

Eth2 is a marketing term used to represent a number of updates to Ethereum. The Eth2 proof-of-stake chain first launched in December 2020. ""The Merge"", which is the event that will fully switch Ethereum's consensus to proof-of-stake, is estimated to be ready in early 2022, although there is no exact timeline. Other updates, such as data shards, will follow that update.

Visit [ethmerge.com](https://ethmerge.com/) to learn more about ""The Merge"".

**Do I need to do anything to update to Eth2? Will Eth2 create a new token?**

No, ETH holders *never* need to take any action to keep holding ETH. Ethereum users will be unaffected by the Eth2 upgrade. And the Eth2 updates will not create any new tokens.

**How can I stake my ETH?**

There are two ways that you can stake your ETH: by running your own validator, or providing your ETH to a staking pool.

* Running your own validator requires a modern computer and 32 ETH. Visit /r/ethstaker for more details
* Staking pools accept any amount of ETH. We recommend [Lido](https://lido.fi/) or [StakeWise](https://stakewise.io/)

**Why are Ethereum transaction fees so high?**

Like most blockchains, Ethereum fees are determined by supply-and-demand. The large demand to use Ethereum has pushed transaction fees quite high (however, fees were just a few cents only 2 years ago). Fees are especially high during market volatility, and during NFT drops.

**What is being done to lower Ethereum transaction fees?**

Ethereum fees are reduced by using layer-2 rollups. Rollups are scaling solutions that allow for significantly cheaper transactions, while still maintaining Ethereum's security.

Additionally, Eth2's data shards will make rollups even cheaper.

While rollups are cutting-edge technology being actively developed, a number are already live on Ethereum mainnet. Visit [l2beat.com](https://l2beat.com/) to learn more about rollups.

**What's the best wallet for Ethereum?**

The most popular tool for using decentralized applications is Metamask. However, for security reasons, we recommend using a hardware wallet such as a Trezor or Ledger.

"Five indicators that the Ethereum merge will occur in June, 2022","1. On February 19, 2022, Ethereum researcher and implementation organizer, Danny Ryan,  gave a talk at EthDenver titled ""Ethereum Proof-of-Stake and our Solar Punk Future"" I implore you to listen to the entire talk six times, but at [minute 13:30, he asks himself the question, ""So, wen?""](https://youtu.be/8N10a1EBhBc?t=810s) and proceeds to answer it. ""It's really actually, very close. I think he's [the difficulty bomb] is going to be impeccably timed. The difficulty bomb is set to go off, to begun to be felt, some time in June, some time in July."" I believe Danny is saying that he doesn't expect a difficulty bomb adjustment, and that the merge fork will occur in enough time to disarm the difficulty bomb.


2. On the [Consensus Layer Call #83](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SEVY6-Zr2OM&t=575s), March 10, 2022, Ben Edgington pointedly asked Danny Ryan why Kiln was pushed back ten days. ""Just a quick recap on why it was pushed back ten days or so, because this is not what we agreed at the last meeting and I'm very mindful of little delays."" Danny's answer is that they were completing some technical items and needed to engage with the wider community, but it's really the **question** that's more telling. The fact that implementers are counting days tells us that they are working diligently to meet the June goal.

3. [The Merge Mainnet Readiness Checklist](https://github.com/ethereum/pm/blob/master/Merge/mainnet-readiness.md) is nearing completion. Evaluating this checklist can be tricky because you can't just compare ""checked"" vs. ""unchecked"" boxes to estimate completion, but if you read the items carefully you'll recognize that the most difficult items have been completed. 


4. On March 10, 2022, Marius Van Der Wijden announced the launch of the [Kiln public merge testnet](https://twitter.com/vdWijden/status/1501853162688421888). This is widely expected to be the final ""one-off"" testnet before the existing testnests. Anyone who has observed these events before will know that those testnets are merged with a launch-ready product. While I don't know the planned timing for those testnet launches, it is very reasonable to expect a two week delay between each testnet merge.

5. The difficulty bomb is specified in [EIP-4345](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4345) and suggests that the time between blocks will begin increasing around June 2022. Because the bomb goes off slowly and is based on block numbers (rather than clock time) it's difficult to predict what the slow-motion explosion will look like in real time. The difficulty bomb is put in place as an accountability mechanism to urge major upgrades to completion. Developers will be pushing against the clock in June to determine if they should do a hard fork to move the difficulty bomb, or use the rare hard fork opportunity to implement the merge. At this time, there is no public statement of anyone encouraging moving the difficulty bomb without also implementing the merge. If we reach July without a merge date we'll all need to pop some popcorn.  

All of these indicators suggest strongly that the merge is on track and will be deployed in June 2022. Here's a funny thing about my prediction: I'd rather steadfastly predict June and be wrong, than lower the community expectation and be right. Lets keep pushing for June.",270.0,2022-03-11 13:52:01,0.99

MIT Names Ethereum PoS 'Top Technological Breakthrough' In 2022,"Shortened version:  


The Massachusetts Institute of Technology has named Ethereum’s upcoming transition to a proof-of-stake blockchain to its list of top technological breakthroughs for 2022.

In a report published on its technology review website, MIT explained how a proof-of-stake consensus mechanism is a way to secure digital currency and end the energy consumption woes that plague the crypto industry  


MIT also named Cardano , Solana, and Algorand as the other “key players” to watch in the PoS space.  


The institution stressed the importance of “The Merge” — the moment when Ethereum officially transitions to PoS and drops the proof-of-work consensus — as a defining moment with the potential to set the stage for wider PoS adoption.

“Ethereum will be the largest network to use proof of stake,” said MIT.

The [REDACTED] ETHDenver 2022 Report,"The outlet for whom this article was intended got cold feet about running it, so here's my report on ETHDenver 2022...

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

The first ETHDenver was in 2018, deep in bear market doldrums. Hopium was lost. There was a whiff of vapor in the ware. Rumor has it that ETHDenver programming that year was just Gitcoin founder Kevin Owocki in a rented bufficorn costume offering bounties for free hugs to an empty auditorium. Even in those salad days of free-wheeling pre-COVID physical contact, few people accepted. Oh, how things have changed.

After surviving an existentially challenging bear market and a near apocalyptic pandemic only to emerge stronger than ever, the mood amongst ETHNerds at ETHDenver 2022 was buoyant, only a gentle caress short of euphoric. Over 20,000 applicants for an event that could comfortably have accommodated a tenth of that meant this year was always going to be an unprecedented clusterfuck. That sense of euphoria lasted only until attendees encountered the line to get in. ETHDenver’s (ostensibly noble) COVID test upon entry policy meant a three hour wait to get in as the line snaked down the block, across the street, and almost into adjacent time zones — all caked in a post-snowstorm slurry. And wait they did, in droves, and for days on end.  

That kind of excitement can only mean one thing. Lines for a COVID test. Lines for the elevator. Lines to get into talks. Lines for the bathroom. Lines *in* the bathroom. Crypto has two modes: Apocalypse and utopia. ETHDenver was firmly the latter. Self-flagellation is out. Self-congratulation is in. That’s because Web3 and DeFi and NFTs and DAOs have all achieved mainstream buzzword status, and none of those exists without Ethereum. You can tip people with ETH on Twitter. Fucky Zucky thought hijacking the metaverse could save his sinking ship. He must be sniffing metamine. Shit, Even Melania Trump bought her own NFT. And if Trump Org is grifting in your backyard, there’s gold in them hills. It’s a whole different kind of gold rush out here in Denver. 

The thing is that Ethereum tech actually works now. Well, sorta. It may cost $73 and take a few hours, but if you want to spend $23 million on a jpeg of a monkey – that utopian reality is yours for the making. Do you want to loan a derivative of a derivative of a derivative of a dog-themed meme coin? Sure! Just please don’t call it a derivative or the SEC will sue everyone. APY? In this economy?! Fuck that. What’s your yield by the *nanosecond*? Imagine your favorite, most esoteric MMORPG, but with the graphics of a 16-bit Animal Crossing. Sounds not bad, right? Now imagine it with a JPMorgan Lounge. That’s Metaverse, baby!   

At any crypto event, you’re gonna hear a heap of new lingo: Ponzinomics, POAP, danksharding, pussyverse, proto-shard data-blobs. Did you know that play-to-earn can solve poverty? That must have something to do with the Doge-wrapped McLaren parked in front of the Art Hotel. It was gone by day 3, so here’s hoping that someone vandalized it. 

It’s 4pm on a weekday in the Castle, in a cavernous side room shrouded in fog and laden with the rolling thud of house music. Countless exhausted future Bufficorns lay supine in beanbag chairs, staring at the canopy of lasers above them weaving cerulean and lavender spears. Excited groups of kids share shots of liquor. A one man dance party shuffles alone in the center of the room until a gaggle of girls bound into the space and join him. Is this a tech conference or a music festival? 

This could be the year that ETHDenver became SXSW for Crypto. It looks like the NFT gold rush has blown the space wide open culturally. The cool kids have arrived, and en masse. You can spot them because they share the same fashion aesthetic as a bored ape: animal prints, goofy sunglasses, glittering sequins, thousand yard stare. It’s too much for some, mostly the jaded blockchain marketing vets standing confused on the outskirts of all things, wondering how they haven’t downloaded Metamask mobile yet despite working in crypto for a half decade. They’ve spent a good portion of their careers slaving for ‘blockchain adoption,’ and now that it’s staring them in the face, they have no idea how to react other than slugging liquor for brunch, dazed,  mumbling to themselves about ConsenSys equity. 

Their energy is in stark contrast to the chillionaires, the very rich, very relaxed individuals with very few complaints about life. They’re the guys who bought hundreds of thousands of ETH at a fraction of a dollar. You can spot them because they’re wearing multiple rolexes on each arm, board shorts and flip flops, even in frigid-ass Denver. Nobody spots them faster than the bizdev shills, though, who are like guppies into the maw of these mega-whales. Here’s how you survive a hard sell from one of those desperate pitchmen who treat you like a microphone: smile and nod, smile and nod. Do not answer any of their rhetorical questions, because they’re all just hooks for another shill. Smile and nod. That’s how a thousandaire becomes a chillionaire.

While incredibly well socialized Ethereum developer Danny Ryan is on stage discussing semantic mismatches in the transition to Proof of Stake, the din from the reaches of the castle is deafening. Grizzled developers in newly spangled swag sweatshirts yuk it up with NFT obsessives in bedazzled leopard print, comparing shillhaul – which this year included free weed, USB lighters, and translucent metal sporks. Tiesto is in the building. The governor of Colorado just showed up. Vitalik’s mum is holding court. Someone dressed as Boba Fett saunters through the crowd. 

“The merge is really, actually very close,” Ryan exhorts over the noise. That gets everyone’s attention. Ethereum Maxis talk about the merge like Heaven’s Gate members talked about the comet. It’s the second coming of Jesus and Jobs and Jehovah alike. On the day the *don’t-call-it-ETH2.0* shards enliven, Vitalik will ride into the floor of the NYSE on a pale unicorn atop a rainbow that rains coins to save us all from our current reality: the one in which we’re already in a bear market and nobody except for VC Cunts and chillionaires have the wherewithal to admit it yet. 

Speaking of: Look to your left. Now look to your right. chances are that one of you is a VC cunt. The ‘VC’ stands for ‘very cunty.’ A message to your ilk from the rest of us: Take your billions of dollars, your fuckin’ social skills, your well-adjusted attachment styles, your consistent sleep habits, your workout routines, your pearly white teeth — and go copy/paste someone else’s Ponzi scheme! 

In the spirit of self-congratulation, ETH devs are here to PARTY. That means drinking enough alcohol to maintain eye contact! Woo! A fresh-faced, motor-mouthed young Web3 acolyte who works for a VC —  although he promises it’s not a cunty VC — has a salient piece of advice for anyone, but especially those in crypto: Never meet your idols. He encountered one of his at an ETHDenver afterparty, a guy ‘worth a quarter of a billion at least,’ languishing in a catatonic state, mumbling about ‘the best acid in Denver.’ Apparently, that did not fit his idea of a post-millennial tech baron. He’s learned better now. 

An interlude: What does a stablecoin have in common with a dominatrix? It’s all fun and games until you’re in too deep and they lose their peg. If it’s UST, you’re moving back into mom’s basement. If it’s your local Mistress, you’re going to the hospital. You’re fucked either way. 

Speaking of fucked: DAOs may be both the ‘new venture capital’ and the ‘next sovereign nations,’ but you may not get that vibe from the myriad DAOs that have proliferated in recent times — BluntDAO, PartyDAO, SporkDAO, SlutDAO, for example. DAOs may change the world yet, but not until they roll a blunt, have a boogie, get the munchies, and visit a sex worker — so just like most politicians, then. 

While an opera singer takes to the stage on the upper BUIDL floors for an impromptu performance, surprise guest Andrew Yang appears on the main stage. The room is packed and the audience listens on rapt. The wider crypto industry has been waiting on tenterhooks on the promise of a damaging Executive Order from President Joe Biden, and Yang has the inside scoop. He’s bullish on the EO, saying it won’t be as bad as many fear, but bearish on the long-term prospects of governmental meddling in the space. He says it’s a call to arms moment for the industry, and that we should all take it upon ourselves to fight back. He suggests gamifying lobbying, which actually sounds like a pretty good idea. 

All of this isn’t to distract from the main point here: a conference with all the Etherati in one place is totally against the ethos of decentralization. Single point of failure! That’s blockchain 101. What happens if one disgruntled Solana dev sneaks into the Castle with a bomb strapped to his back? They are capable of this. Those guys blow up their own chain on a monthly basis.

The real stuff at ETHDenver is on the upper floors of the Castle, where the devs have been at work hackathoning away since before the hordes arrived, and where they remained when the hordes left. Developers are more mythical beast than the bufficorn could ever be, and here’s where you find those rare creatures in their habitat, buried deep behind the hype machines and money printers. Rows and rows of people, heads down, headphones on. This is the actual source of the substance of the event, the whole industry even. Shit, maybe even the whole world. Every so often, they take breaks to eat stale pizza and play DDR and Mario kart in the arcade, drum and bass blasting all the while. It’s on these floors that  you’ll find anything resembling solace in the chaos. 

ETHDenver is a place where the developers who build the stuff, the shills who sell it, the storytellers who narrate it, and now the consumers who actually use it are all there under one roof. Yeah, it’s disorganized, but this is the kind of chaos from whence *stuff* happens. When things get organized, they get lame. ETHDenver is the Birthplace of BUIDL, and it retains that accolade. Sure, 20,000 applicants and only about 150 hackathon projects offers a ratio of about 1 in 20 builders to shillers, but that’s pretty fucking good for crypto. Your average Bitcoin conference is just a mass congregation of undersexed sociopaths yelling past each other about Wikipedia-level macroeconomics. In comparison, ETHDenver is a wellspring of substance and positive energy. 

Unfortunately the price of ETH did not mirror the buoyancy of the energy of ETHDenver, dropping over 15% over the course of the week. But nobody talked about markets or asset prices, even as they dropped precipitously and consistently all weekend. There’s something beautiful about that. ETHDenver envisions itself as a builder of culture for Ethereum, decentralization, and the creation of value in communities, and it does come good on that promise. 

There’s two surefire ways to know when a party is over. The first is when you receive a COVID exposure notification from the exclusive afterparty the night prior. The second is when fuckin’ Diplo shows up. Both happened on Sunday night. The Denver airport was apparently like an Ethereum transaction mempool on Sunday night, so most of you are using the same criteria for figuring out when it’s time to GTFO. ",101.0,2022-02-23 16:20:25,0.94
A [hopefully] brief history of client diversity on the beacon chain,"I wanted to give a broad overview of client diversity on the beacon chain, both for my own record and to frame it within the larger picture of decentralization. I'm limited on time, so I'll probably skip attributions and links (but I may return to add them later). I'm not claiming any of this is accurate, it's just the perspective of a guy without much else to do.

To go WAAAAAY back, the Ethereum Foundation offered grants to client implementation teams several years ago. They had names like Status, Parity, Artemis, and Harmony. At one point I think there were twelve different client implementation teams, but by early 2020 that had narrowed down to about four: Nimbus, Lighthouse, Teku, and Prysm. Lodestar was also a contender, but they focused on tooling & libraries rather than being a user-ready staking client.

The design philosophy behind multiple independent clients is that we should develop a standardized protocol and implement it in several different programming languages, and if the protocol is well defined then the clients would interoperate seamlessly. This kind of ""spec driven"" design is a way of reducing individual client faults because a fault in any client would stand out clearly. On the contrary, a protocol with only one implementation has no cross check to ensure good implementation.

Around April 2020, Prysm began releasing public testnets like [topaz](https://poap.gallery/event/184) in which EthStaker held public launch calls and created training resources to help users onboard. Prysm was the most active discord and they created easy front end tooling so that anyone who wanted to join their testnet could. To say it plainly, Prysm was very popular with all users.

According to my POAP record, the Medalla testnet launched [August 4, 2020](https://poap.gallery/event/350). EthStaker recognized the need for client diversity at that time and /u/lamboshinakaghini and /u/butta_tribot worked together to create a graffiti scheme that would reward testnet participants with a POAP for trying each of the different clients. We recognized at that time that Prysm had significantly high market share, and we tried to influence that by encouraging users to try clients they hadn't ever used before. (To see this, go to https://poap.gallery and search for ""Medalla""). I should briefly point out that a problem with Prysm's clock sync led to a [six day loss of finality](https://poap.gallery/event/366) that many of us regarded as a good stress test for the network and a real-life lesson of the need for client diversity.

Mainnet deposits opened in November 2020 and met the [threshold for mainnet launch on November 24, 2020](https://poap.gallery/event/661). The beacon chain [mainnet launch](https://poap.gallery/event/553) occurred on December 1, 2020. At the time, many people were desperate to stake, but it was seen as very difficult when compared to non-technical DPOS staking. DPOS staking is centralized by design, and that's a weakness that didn't fit into the decentralized ethos of Ethereum. EthStaker promoted solo-first staking and begged users to wait for trustless, open source, and decentralized staking solutions, but the first of this generation were still a year away. ([Rocket Pool](https://rocketpool.net) is currently the only trustless, decentralized, open source, and permissionless staking provider available and I am a very proud fan/user/supporter.)

Users did what any rational actor does, they went with the path of least resistance and highest gain, which turned out to be solutions like Coinbase, Kraken, and Lido. For their part, these three providers applied common sense and used the most popular staking client [~~(and the only one with a remote signer at the time)~~](https://nitter.net/benjaminion_xyz/status/1496376888792604673#m) and staked user funds on Prysm. While I did, and still do encourage users to stake in the most decentralized way they can, I recognize that the path of least resistance is often the winner, and so it was in this case. We must recognize that staking with centralized providers is contrary to the decentralized ethos of Ethereum, and doing so actively devalues the coins we hold.

Fast forward to 2021 and most stakers had settled into a groove. We could see from our best available metrics, tools like the [Miga Labs Crawler](https://migalabs.es/crawler/dashboard), that there were a disproportionately high number of nodes running prysm, but we had no real knowledge of how many validators each node was running. A node can run somewhere between 0 and several hundred thousand validators, so it was POSSIBLE that we had block proposal diversity even if we didn't have node diversity.

[Michael Sproul](https://twitter.com/sproulM_) from the Lighthouse team really helped us to get things moving. He realized that he could identify the block proposer client by fingerprinting the order that attestations were packed into block proposals and identify the proposing client with a high degree of certainty (this is now available as [blockprint](https://github.com/sigp/blockprint)). A few months later, I noticed that [Invisible Symbol](https://twitter.com/0xinvis) from the Rocket Pool #Trading discord was posting some really interesting operator data, specifically, he had data that linked many more validators to their operators than anyone else, notably, he had developed an accurate list of Coinbase's validators which had previously been hiding. 

With Michael and 0xInvis working together, we very quickly uncovered the first set of data for what became https://pools.invis.cloud around [February 13, 2022](https://twitter.com/0xinvis/status/1492936618449199109). When combined with [Joseph Cook's](https://twitter.com/tothepoles) incredible ability to explain complex concepts simply, pools.invis.cloud was ready to launch. After giving the pools a chance to respond but not hearing anything, we published the data showing that Coinbase and Kraken were the primary Prysm offenders. To be honest, this was a huge revelation for EthStaker because we had just spent the past year trying to get grandma to change her one Prysm validator thinking it would matter - when the two biggest providers were running a combined 78,000 Prysm validators.

It really only took pools.invis.cloud a week to do its work. I had accurate information that [I could share publicly](https://twitter.com/superphiz/status/1495397371466944523) to encourage pools to acknowledge our community and engage. [Kraken responded first](https://twitter.com/krakensupport/status/1495590333085798400) followed by [Coinbase](https://twitter.com/emiliemc/status/1496256781638840320). While the messages vary, they are an acknowledgement of the need for client diversity on the beacon chain.

That brings us to the present moment. The merge is about three months away (just a guess) and we have communications from the two biggest Prysm operators that they're willing to implement more minority client validators. I sincerely welcome their engagement and I'm glad to have them as participants in our community. But here's the thing - we can't stop pushing until client diversity ACTUALLY appears on the network. Even then, we have to keep pushing until no client has more than 50% of the validators. I know we've made a lot of progress, but we can't stop pushing until the job is done.

I know we're in the middle of this client diversity challenge, but I also want to look ahead and begin preparing for our next obstacle. I believe the next decentralization challenge we'll face is limiting operators to holding less than 20% of validators on the network. Right now Coinbase has about 16% of active validators, and I think we're going to want to come together as a community and say, ""Thank you for providing this service, but you're becoming a risk to our decentralized network."" This won't be an easy conversation, and it's not one large providers want to hear, but it's in all of our best interest.

I want to thank the EthStaker team as well as the broader community for their commitment to decentralizing the beacon chain. I appreciate that SO many people have stood with us to improve our community. Thank you.

That was really long, and I desperately need someone who is not me to develop a POAP to celebrate our current progress. <3",78.0,2022-02-23 02:27:01,0.97
Announcement: Ethereum Classic on Flexpool (Daily Airdrops to celebrate the launch coming),"We are pleased to announce our third coin on Flexpool - Ethereum Classic. We have chosen it because it's one of the most mined coins out there, as it is the most profitable coin to mine on 4 GB GPUs. We’re launching with 3 regions (US East, Germany, and Singapore), and we will open more soon if needed. Start mining Ethereum Classic (ETC) on Flexpool here: [https://www.flexpool.io/get-started/etc/GPU](https://www.flexpool.io/get-started/etc/GPU).

# 1. Cryptocurrency

Let’s start from ground zero: cryptocurrencies. 

Everyone has heard of this term, but few know what it means. It derives from two words: cryptography and currency. **Cryptography** is at the basis of all cryptocurrencies as all of them depend on it to secure transaction records, to control the creation of additional coins, to verify the transfer of coins, and most importantly, to make them decentralized.

Secondly, they’re called **currency** because well, cryptos are a currency.. ~~for the most part~~.

Now, a cryptocurrency is a form of digital asset, so online, based on a network that is distributed across a vast number of computers, and they are based on something referred to as a distributed ledger, or, more specifically, blockchain technology.

&#x200B;

# 2. Centralized and Decentralized

The difference between centralized and decentralized is that in a centralized system, as the name suggests, the power and control are in the hands of a central authority, usually it’s a very small and limited group of individuals, such as the owner of a business, or the director of bank, whereas a decentralized system is controlled by everyone who partakes in that system. In the case of crypto, it can be you, me, and everyone else.

The main point of cryptocurrencies is that they are decentralized, which contrasts with the traditional monetary payment systems such as banks and financial institutions, which are heavily centralized.

&#x200B;

# 3. Distributed Ledger

A distributed ledger is a **PUBLIC** decentralized database that is shared and synchronized by multiple people who have equal access to all the information shared across that network and can own an identical copy of it. Nobody is cut out, and everyone who wishes to partake in it, can do so.

One of the types of these distributed ledger databases is none other than blockchain, which is what cryptocurrencies are fundamentally based on.

&#x200B;

# 4. Blockchain

A blockchain is a database that is shared among the participants, also called computers or nodes, of a network, and it stores information digitally. They are best known for their crucial role in cryptocurrency systems for maintaining a secured and decentralized record of transactions.

The mind-blowing innovation is that this technology guarantees the security of the data stored in it, without the need for a trusted third party, in other words not only there will be no need to have a central authority, but this technology was designed to be entirely public to anyone. You don’t see a bank’s internal transaction, you don’t see a company’s financial statements, but you see each Bitcoin user’s balance and transactions.

Another key difference between a typical database and a blockchain is how the data is structured. A blockchain, collects information together in groups, known as blocks, that hold sets of information together. These digital blocks, which are blocks just metaphorically speaking but not in the literal sense, have certain storage capacities, for example, each Bitcoin’s block is **1MB** and can contain on average **2500 transactions**.

When a block is filled and completed, it is linked to the previous completed block in a way we’ll see shortly, effectively forming a chain of blocks containing data, known as a blockchain.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

# 5. Satoshi

This brings us to the first and most famous cryptocurrency that everyone knows, Bitcoin. It was created in **January 2009** by the pseudonymous **Satoshi Nakamoto**. No one to this day knows who he is, and people have been speculating about his identity for over a decade with speculations ranging from, for example, that he may have been a group of people rather than a single individual, or perhaps even one of the three letter agencies. There are a few valid candidates, but no one knows for sure.

One thing however that is for sure is Satoshi’s hatred for banks and for the people at the top who hold the power to control financial systems to the point where they can willingly cause citizens to lose their livelihoods, homes, and sometimes, even lives through financial crashes, without any repercussion, such as the 2008 housing market crash.

Satoshi is said to own close to **1 million Bitcoins** divided in multiple addresses, which would place him at a net worth of 40 billion dollars today if it’s true, and IF he is still alive, and those are two big ifs.

 

# 6. White Paper

Satoshi published the white paper of BTC in **October 2008.** A white paper, in cryptocurrency, is a document released by a project’s funders, not only in the case of Bitcoin, but in the case of any ~~serious~~ crypto project.

A white paper gives technical information about a project and its future roadmap. Satoshi’s vision for Bitcoin was quote “A purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash would allow online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution"". He wanted people to have the means to make payments with a currency, Bitcoin, without being under the control of the big guys at the top while doing so.

But then begs the question.. how is consensus achieved? How do all the participants agree which transactions are valid and which are not, in a situation where everything is public and everyone, including bad people, can see everything?

&#x200B;

# 7. Consensus Mechanism 

Here comes into play the part of consensus mechanisms. It is the process through which the nodes in charge of a blockchain database achieve consensus on the validity of each transaction and decide if to proceed with it, or not.

Being that everyone can take part in a blockchain we needed something to prevent any malicious user trying to hijack the network, for example, by creating fake transactions where he gives himself all the Bitcoins in existence and becomes the richest person in the world. This is also known as the double spending problem, and Bitcoin was the first system to solve it.

To solve this, cryptocurrencies need some type of consensus method, through which, everyone taking part in the system, comes to a mutual agreement. There are multiple types of consensus mechanisms, **the two main ones are Proof of Work and Proof of Stake**.

# 

# 8. Proof of Work

Proof of Work (PoW) is a decentralized consensus mechanism that requires all the participants of a network to spend computational power, solving a complex mathematical equation, commonly referred to as mining, to prevent anybody from manipulating the system.

Now, let’s start with an example to make things easier.

There are two friends, Bob and Alice. Each have $20 worth of Bitcoin and Bob sends Alice $10 of those $20, in a Bitcoin transaction. The transaction is placed in a block together with about 2500 other transactions, the block then gets confirmed and recorded into the blockchain. Now, Bob effectively has $10 worth of BTC, and Alice has $30 worth of BTC.

To avoid Bob claiming he never sent that $10 worth of Bitcoin in the original block, there was let’s call it a code, more specifically **hash**, placed in that block and it looked like this:

**000000000019d6689c085ae165831e934ff763ae46a2a6c172b3f1b60a8ce26f** 

(First Bitcoin's Block Hash)

That hash uniquely identified the block which got filled with Bob and Alice’s transaction. It was created through an algorithm, and it was a sort of summary of all those unique 2500 transactions that took place in that block.

The following block will not only have its own unique hash as well, but that hash will merge with Bob and Alice’s block’s hash, forming a final hash and connecting the two blocks together, effectively creating a chain of linked blocks where each new block is connected to the previous one.

The third block will again have its own hash merged with the hash of the second block, which was merged with the hash of Bob and Alice’s block.

The catch point is, if just 1 of those 2500 transactions in each block is altered, the entire hash for that block will change, even if the other 2499 transactions are intact. This will inevitably cause the second block to be invalid as its hash wouldn’t match with the first block’s hash, which will cause the third block to not match with the hash of the second one and so on, and so on, effectively creating a chain  of events. ~~I know, this joke was not funny at all, but I wanted to say it.~~

Do you see where I am getting with this?

The transactions are in the blocks, and all the blocks are linked together.

If Bob would alter his original transaction, the hash of the block in which the transaction was placed would change and would make all the following blocks with all the transactions in them, invalid. To successfully fake or alter a transaction, he would need to control a majority, at least 51%, of the entire computing power of the Bitcoin blockchain, to manipulate the following blocks quicker than the honest participants of the network.

All of this, finally brings us to mining.

&#x200B;

# 9. Mining

Mining, which is applied to any cryptocurrency based on Proof of Work such as Bitcoin, Ethereum (for now), Dogecoin, Litecoin and many more, is the process by which new coins enter in circulation. It is also the way a network confirms new transactions, and it is a critical component of a blockchain ledger's maintenance and development.

Participants need to use their computational power through specific mining hardware, called application-specific integrated circuit, or **ASIC**s, to solve a complex and random mathematical equation in order to create a new block.

Put in simple terms, those very powerful machines have to guess a certain number. The more computer power you have, the higher the chances to guess that number before anyone else does are.

Whoever guesses it first, will effectively create a new block and new Bitcoins (or any other crypto that is mined) into existence, and those Bitcoins will be rewarded to them as a reward for the time and effort they had to put in to sustain the network.

This process allows for the removal of bad players from the ecosystem, as taking part in it requires huge amounts of resources such as space, electricity, and especially the costs of mining hardware.

You need to know however that not all Proof of Work cryptos require ASIC card to be mined. It depends on the algorithm on which a crypto is built on. Any mineable crypto can be mined in one of two ways, either through ASIC cards or normal GPUs such as Nvidia or AMD cards.

For example, to mine Ethereum, the second largest crypto, you can do it from your computer’s graphics card and does not require you to buy any additional components, and that’s why all Nvidia’s new 3000 series GPUs are always sold out.

Mining has extensively been up to debate as it consumes a lot of electricity due to the huge power consumption of graphics cards. Back in the day, you could mine Bitcoin from your laptop, but those days are long gone now. 

Now. Here is where the genius of Satoshi comes into place, which is applied to any proof of work cryptocurrency, not just Bitcoin.

The more powerful GPUs get, the more difficult it will become to solve this mathematical equation and create new blocks.

Wait.. what? Shouldn’t it become faster rather than slower, if more powerful components become available? 

Bitcoin was programmed so that one block would be mined every 10 minutes on average, and every 2016 blocks, or about two weeks, or the algorithm calculates how long it took to mine those blocks. If it took more than 14 days it means that it was too difficult and the difficulty will decrease, if it took less than 14 days it means that it was too easy, and the difficulty will increase. The more people enter the network and start mining, the more difficult mining becomes to obtain the same results and the more powerful GPU’s will be required to produce those same results.

**Each Bitcoin block rewards 6.25 Bitcoins to the winner. This reward is cut in half approximately every 4 years and it is called halving.**

At the beginning, the reward was 50 BTC per block. The first halving happened in 2012 and it reduced the block reward to 25 BTC. The second halving was in 2016 and it reduced the reward to 12.5 BTC, and finally, the last halving happened in May 2020 which brought the reward to 6.25BTC per block. The next one will be in 2024 and it will drop the reward to 3.125 BTC.

On a final note, mining crypto on your own, especially in the case of Bitcoin, is close to impossible unless you are considerably wealthy, because it would require an absurd amount of capital just to have a small chance to mine a block, that’s why there are networks called mining pools, made of thousands if not tens of thousands of people combining their computing power to mine one specific crypto together and proportionally split the block rewards. The vast majority of mining pools are either in Bitcoin or Ethereum.

&#x200B;

# 10. Proof of Stake

As the second most used consensus mechanism, we have Proof of Stake. The holders of a Proof of Stake crypto will deposit and lock up, called staking, the coins of that crypto that they own, and **become a validator**. By doing this, they will get the chance to be chosen to validate the next block, and whoever does it, will be rewarded the block reward.

Whether a validator will get chosen to validate the next block will depend on different factors, two of the main ones are randomness and how many coins they staked. This cuts out the gigantic energy and resources consumption that happens with Proof of Work as with Proof of Stake you do not require any sort of specific computer hardware.

At the same time however, people argue that this consensus mechanism tends to reward those already wealthy, as the more coins you have, the more likely the chances to be randomly selected and earn the block rewards are.

Some argue that this makes the ecosystem more centralized as wealthier individuals become even wealthier, however, the same argument can also be applied to Proof of Work, as if you have more capital you can afford to buy more mining equipment which in contrast will generate more revenue. 

&#x200B;

# 11. Ethereum

This connects us to Ethereum. The second largest cryptocurrency by market cap since its creation in 2016, second only to Bitcoin.

Ethereum has always been on POW just like Bitcoin, but it is currently migrating to POS to solve several issues such as transaction fees, called gas fees, and transactions per second.

The main difference from Bitcoin, is that Ethereum features a key technology called “smart contracts”.

&#x200B;

# 12. Smart Contracts

Smart contracts are automated programs, built on the Ethereum blockchain, or any other blockchain with smart contract capabilities. **They are fully controlled by code** and once deployed on the blockchain, they cannot be changed or altered. They allow you to build multiple programmable functions on top of them, to be executed once a criteria is met.

With Bitcoin, for example, all you can do is transfer the coin as a means of payment and you cannot build anything on top of its blockchain. With Ethereum however, besides transferring its main coin, Ether, you can build and create all sorts of applications on it.

And no, Ether and Ethereum are not quite exactly the same thing. Ethereum is the blockchain, the network, the foundation, whereas Ether is the native coin of the blockchain.

The most famous examples of smart contracts by far, are well, NFTs, and it shouldn’t really come at a surprise.

On the other hand, however, there are also useful smart contracts that provide real financial services, such as crypto lending and borrowing, decentralized exchanges, liquidity pools, insurance services, and much more, but we will get into that a bit later.

&#x200B;

# 13. Coin vs Token

Now. All of them are cryptocurrencies, but not all of them are coins or tokens. Many people call them coins when in reality, they are tokens or call them tokens when in reality, they are coins.

The difference is that **a coin is native to its own blockchain**, Ether is a coin native to its own blockchain called Ethereum. Bitcoin is a coin native to its own blockchain called Bitcoin. Shiba inu, however, is a token because it is built on Ethereum’s blockchain. Creating a fully operable blockchain is way more difficult than creating a token on an already established blockchain.

&#x200B;

# 14. Tokenomics

Now, let’s get into how the value of a cryptocurrency is derived and its tokenomics, which is simply a term that indicates the economics of a crypto.

**Supply** \- The first and most important thing of any given cryptocurrency is the supply. This can be further divided into three categories:

* **Maximum Supply**
* **Total Supply**
* **Circulating Supply**

*Maximum Supply* \- It is the amount of tokens or coins of a crypto that will ever exist, including the ones that will be created through mining, staking, or made available in the future. Bitcoin's maximum supply is 21,000,000 coins which will only be reached in over 100 years from now. Ethereum, on the other hand, has an unlimited max supply.

*Total Supply* – It is the amount of coins or tokens of a crypto currently in existence, including the ones that may not be publicly available, such as those locked in an escrow or held by the team, but without counting the coins or tokens yet to be created and put into existence through mining, staking etc.

*Circulating Supply* \- Circulating supply is the amount of a crypto in circulation in the present moment and in the hands of the general public, EXCLUDING the coins or tokens of that crypto, that are locked or held by entities such as the team behind the project.

**Market Cap** – Market capitalization, or market cap for short, is the dollar value of all the coins or tokens of a crypto combined and it is calculated by multiplying the total supply by the last price a single coin or token was sold for. In the case of Bitcoin, there are approximately 18,950,000 Bitcoins, and with about $40,000 per coin, it would place the market cap at around 750 billion dollars.

&#x200B;

# 15. Exchanges

Now, However, begs the question, where are these cryptocurrencies bought from and how do you store them safely?

Cryptocurrencies are generally bought from what are called **centralized exchanges**. They are regulated companies which provide you the service of acting as a trusted middlemen between the people who want to sell a specific crypto, and the people who want to buy it.

They decide which cryptos to list and there is no exchange that has all the cryptos in existence listed. It is a decision up to them. There are exchanges which list as many cryptos as possible to earn as much as they can, and exchanges known for listing as few as possible, but when they do, it’s all over the news ~~\*cough\* Coinbase \*cough\*~~.

The way they stay in business is by charging a small commission on each trade. The typical commission fee averages between 0.05% and 0.1%, and the larger your order will be, the lesser you will pay in fees.

&#x200B;

# 16. Wallets

After you purchase a cryptocurrency on an exchange, the next step is always choosing how to store it safely. There are two main types of crypto storages. Custodial and non-custodial wallets.

**Custodial Wallets -** Someone else retains custody of your assets. You do not own your cryptos but they do, on your behalf. These are mostly the previously mentioned exchanges, and this is where the famous phrase in the crypto community “not your keys, not your coins” comes from.

By giving up custody of your funds, you have a better peace of mind because you do not bear the responsibility of securing your assets and all the risks involved with it.

The Crypto community however has mixed feelings on whether holding your cryptos on an exchange is worth it due to previous exchange hacks which resulted in stolen and lost funds on multiple occasions. On top of that, it totally ruins the goal of crypto: to escape from the control of centralized entities and aiming to be our own banks.

**Non-Custodial Wallets** \- These are the wallets that you personally own and hold your crypto in. They can be mainly divided into two categories: hot wallets and cold wallets.

**Hot Wallets** \- They are software, usually apps you can download on your phone, such as the Trust wallet, Exodus or Coinbase wallet. They do offer a fantastic grade of protection and are free to use. You are the only owner of your assets and under most circumstances they are more than enough to protect what you hold, but if your device becomes compromised, you can lose everything. 

The most famous hot wallet by far is Metamask. It’s an Ethereum based wallet that comes as a web browser extension and every Ethereum compatible blockchain, such as Binance Smart Chain, Polygon and Avalanche, plus all the decentralized applications built on those blockchains, are compatible with Metamask. They also have a mobile app, but it’s not used as often.

**Cold Wallets** \- They are offline physical devices such as the Ledger Nano and the Trezor. You usually connect them to the computer through a cable and use a specific program to access them.

The difference is that you will have to write your mnemonic phrase, we’ll get into what it is shortly, and approve transactions from the device itself which cannot get accessed unless someone has physical access to it, and as it is offline it can’t be hacked. They offer a way higher grade of protection because they do not rely on the security of your mobile phone or computer and that’s why they cost from around $60 to $200 to buy, depending on the type and features. For this reason, it isn’t the best option if you do not have much money to begin investing with. 

Broadly speaking, most crypto holders, including myself, tend to agree that if you have a small capital to invest, it might be better to keep it on an established exchange, especially if it is in Ethereum, and transferring those coins out would cost a fortune in transaction fees.

The most important thing to know if you decide to buy a hardware wallet, is to **ALWAYS** buy it from the official company’s website and not from a third-party seller, even if you might find it discounted. This is because you would increase the risk of receiving a tampered device, which is by no means worth it just to save a few dollars.

&#x200B;

# 17. Mnemonic Phrases

Now, mnemonic phrases. All you need to know to keep your crypto safe is that when you create a so called “account” on a wallet, you are given a random set of 12-18-24 words which is called a mnemonic phrase. This combination of words will act as a password to access all your crypto. These words are randomly chosen from a specific list of 2048 words, and each word can all be identified by the first four letters. This technology was designed so that we could have a human readable “password” instead of a random set of numbers and letters.

**THE MOST IMPORTANT THING** you need to understand is that your crypto will **NOT** be stored in that mobile app or ledger device, but on the blockchain. The wallets are just a gateway, like an intermediary, that provide an easy-to-use interface for everyone.  The one and only thing you must carefully store, is the mnemonic phrase.

If you lose your phone with a hot wallet installed, or a hardware device like the ledger nano, nothing will happen to your crypto as long as you still have access to the mnemonic phrase, which you can use to restore your crypto on a new wallet.

You absolutely **MUST** write down on at least two pieces of paper those words, **NEVER** take pictures or screenshots of them, store them safely and never tell anyone where they are.

Do not try to bury your ledger nano 10 feet under the ground, the only thing that matters is the mnemonic phrase which can be restored on any wallet, both hot and cold. 

As you can imagine, the difficulty with self-custody is evident. If you lose access to both your seed phrase and to the device where it was connected, your crypto will be lost forever. Hacking a mnemonic phrase is impossible, and 99% of those “hacking” claims you see online are simply because people’s phones or computers were either compromised or they accidentally screenshotted or emailed themselves the mnemonic phrase, or sometimes even both, for the sake of comfort, and it got leaked.

&#x200B;

# 18. Types of Cryptocurrencies

Going back to Cryptos. There are many types of cryptocurrencies, but only about eight are the most common:

* **Store of Values**
* **Smart Contracts**
* **Stablecoins**
* **Payments**
* **Privacy**
* **Exchange Tokens or Coins**
* **Governance tokens**
* **Sh\*tcoins** 

*Store of Value* \- They are designed to hold their value and purchasing power over time. The only crypto which is arguably considered to be one is Bitcoin because it has always tremendously increased in value over time since its inception rather than losing value like our beloved fiat currencies. People believe it is an effective hedge against inflation and that’s why Bitcoin is sometimes referred to as digital gold.

*Smart Contract* \- They are designed to be programmable and allow building applications on their blockchain, for different purposes. The most famous and used one, is Ethereum. This brought to the creation of Decentralized finance, or DEFI, in which we’ll get into in a minute. Other examples of smart contract cryptos are Binance Smart Chain, Avalanche and Solana.

*Stablecoins* \- They are usually pegged to fiat currencies, mostly, to the US dollar. They hold all the properties of any other crypto, but their value is… stable. For example, when a stablecoin is indeed pegged to the dollar, the goal will always be to maintain and hold the value of one dollar per coin. They aim to eliminate price volatility and to provide a stable medium of exchange without the need to cash out, or, in other words, without the need to withdraw those dollars to your bank account. Examples are: USDT (to avoid), USDC, BUSD and DAI

*Payment* \- They are very fast and cost very little to transact with. They are exceptionally good for transferring money quickly and cheaply. However, they tend to be more centralized as they require powerful machines to run them which normal people have no access to.

*Privacy* \- They have.. well, privacy. You see, the thing with Bitcoin that not many understand is that it is pseudonymous. All the transactions, addresses and balances are nameless, but public. Everything can be easily tracked, but nobody knows which address you own. If, however, someone finds it out, they will immediately see how much you own, who you sent crypto to, and all your transactions. There are cryptos, however, that offer full privacy and anonymity of balances and transactions. Examples are Monero and Zcash.

*Exchange Tokens or Coins* \- They are created by the exchanges from which you can purchase crypto. They offer you perks such as fee discounts if you hold their coin or token and use it to pay for the fees. The most famous one is by far Binance, and its coin, Binance coin. If you paid attention I said coin, and that is because Binance also created its own blockchain called Binance Smart Chain, with BNB as the native coin, just like ETH is the native coin of Ethereum.

*Governance Tokens* \- They grant voting and management powers to their users. They are very important in DeFi ecosystems such as Uniswap.

*Memecoins, also called Sh\*tcoins* \- They are always created on other blockchains, just like Shiba Inu is on Ethereum. The only major exception is Dogecoin, which has its own blockchain. They serve no purpose or utility and people just buy them in the hopes of making money, which sometimes works, don’t get me wrong, otherwise we wouldn’t be hearing about them, but the best way to describe them, is gambling.

&#x200B;

# 19. DeFi

Now that we covered the basics of the basics, and I know it’s lot, especially if you’re a beginner, let’s get into the final part with a bit more complex stuff.

**DeFi** \- As we mentioned, smart contracts are automated programs that are built to follow a specific function, such as if I give you X amount of ETH, I receive X amount of a token built on Ethereum. Once deployed on a blockchain, these smart contracts cannot be changed, hence they are decentralized.

If you combine multiple smart contracts into something more complex, you get decentralized finance, or DeFi, with decentralized applications, or **DAPPs**.

DeFi is a collective term for financial products and services that are built on a blockchain and are accessible to anyone. These services are always open and there are no centralized authorities who can block payments or deny you access to something, as everything is fully based on code.

In other words, DeFi cuts out the middleman and offers financial services to everyone, and unlike banks, it does so without discrimination. Let’s get now into a couple of examples of real world use cases.

**Decentralized Exchanges** \- They are simply exchanges where you can trade cryptocurrencies, with the difference that they are decentralized. They are built on one or multiple blockchains and you can trade any token built on that blockchain (or blockchains). These can range from stablecoins, to governance tokens, to meme coins.

The main pros of using a decentralized exchange is the fact that you do not need to create an account or share your personal information, everything is done in a completely anonymous way. You usually just need to create a Metamask wallet, and you are good to go.

On the downside however, if you want to trade Ethereum based tokens, you will pay astronomical transaction fees, and on top of that, you will be the only person responsible for any loss of funds.

The most famous example is Uniswap, and you can use it to trade any token built on Ethereum.

&#x200B;

**Lending and Borrowing** \- I’ll start this one with an example. Let’s say you own 2000$ worth of ETH and you believe that it is going to go to the moon soon. Let’s also hypothetically say that you find yourself in a real-life emergency situation and you need 1000$.

You will now have two options. You can either sell half of your ETH and call it a day, but miss out on an eventual price appreciation, or you can lock up your ETH as collateral in a lending and borrowing decentralized application and borrow 1000$ worth of a stable coin against the collateral that you just deposited. This way, you will end up with keeping your position in ETH and be able to ride it and you will also get the $1000 you need.

To get back your ETH you would obviously need to pay back your debt of $1000 plus the occurring borrowing fees.

Respectively, if you wish to earn passive income, you can lock up your Crypto with the ability to withdraw it anytime (zoom face) and lend it to those interested in borrowing it just like in our previous example. In exchange, you will earn an interest, which is way higher than the 0.5% that a bank’s savings account gives you, while the inflation rate for 2021 rose up 7%.

**Frequently Asked Questions**

**Where's the best place to buy ETH?**

There are many centralized exchanges that support Ethereum. If you live in the US, the most popular exchanges are Coinbase, Gemeni and Kraken. Coinbase users can use Coinbase Pro for lower fees.

**When is Eth2 launching?**

Eth2 is a marketing term used to represent a number of updates to Ethereum. The Eth2 proof-of-stake chain first launched in December 2020. ""The Merge"", which is the event that will fully switch Ethereum's consensus to proof-of-stake, is estimated to be ready in early 2022, although there is no exact timeline. Other updates, such as data shards, will follow that update.

Visit [ethmerge.com](https://ethmerge.com/) to learn more about ""The Merge"".

**Do I need to do anything to update to Eth2? Will Eth2 create a new token?**

No, ETH holders *never* need to take any action to keep holding ETH. Ethereum users will be unaffected by the Eth2 upgrade. And the Eth2 updates will not create any new tokens.

**How can I stake my ETH?**

There are two ways that you can stake your ETH: by running your own validator, or providing your ETH to a staking pool.

* Running your own validator requires a modern computer and 32 ETH. Visit /r/ethstaker for more details
* Staking pools accept any amount of ETH. We recommend [Lido](https://lido.fi/) or [StakeWise](https://stakewise.io/)

**Why are Ethereum transaction fees so high?**

Like most blockchains, Ethereum fees are determined by supply-and-demand. The large demand to use Ethereum has pushed transaction fees quite high (however, fees were just a few cents only 2 years ago). Fees are especially high during market volatility, and during NFT drops.

**What is being done to lower Ethereum transaction fees?**

Ethereum fees are reduced by using layer-2 rollups. Rollups are scaling solutions that allow for significantly cheaper transactions, while still maintaining Ethereum's security.

Additionally, Eth2's data shards will make rollups even cheaper.

While rollups are cutting-edge technology being actively developed, a number are already live on Ethereum mainnet. Visit [l2beat.com](https://l2beat.com/) to learn more about rollups.

**What's the best wallet for Ethereum?**

The most popular tool for using decentralized applications is Metamask. However, for security reasons, we recommend using a hardware wallet such as a Trezor or Ledger.

NFTs in Mobile Gaming and Deep Diving into Possible Use Cases with Specific Examples: Pokemon GO x GameStop,"There is a tl’dr at the end

Hey all! I’ve been impressed by the level of due diligence and the plethora of information and contribution on this sub. In lieu of the GameStop x Immutable X partnership and the interview by Robbie Ferguson, I was inspired to do a quick write-up on my thoughts on the matter of NFTs (non-fungible tokens) and why the future/metaverse is incredibly buoyant for anyone currently invested in GME.

To begin, I want to preface by saying that due to work circumstances, I am now exclusively a mobile gamer (I know, don’t judge… ;-;) . Most of my gaming experiences have been through Nintendo games on handhelds such as the 3DS, Gameboy, etc. and that while console/PC game NFT applications can be vaguely understood, NFTs bleed into the mobile market as well. In fact, in my opinion… the infrastructure is already laid: in-game assets and random generation of traits for in-game collectibles in many games for consoles, PCs, and mobile exist. To illustrate how NFTs can merge into the current gaming paradigm non-invasively, I will be drawing my points from the 2016 mobile game Pokemon GO. It is important to note that while I am demonstrating the potential for Pokemon NFTs, the ideas and elements presented herein do apply to practically any game or IP, existent or emergent, with collectible creatures (i.e. Digimon, Neopets, Axies, etc). Therefore, if you do not like Pokemon… that is okay; please bear with me. 🤣

It should be noted that this should not be taken as DD. Nothing here is concrete, but it draws upon the ideas presented prior in this sub, with respect to GameStop’s highly speculated NFT marketplace and the Immutable X partnership. I also do not work for Pokemon GO nor do I work for Nintendo and there is zero guarantee that anything in this post will occur in reality; this is to explore possible early use cases and feasibility to demonstrate what is possible as maybe five or ten years from now in an NFT-driven GameStop marketplace. Ideas here are not intended to be specific to Pokemon GO and are widely usable to any game developer that wishes to engage in the Metaverse. This is not a push to make Pokemon GO an NFT game… only a demonstration, clarification, and proof of workability to show how NFTs can practically merge without disruption with one of the oldest gaming franchises. Ergo, some in-game elements specific to Pokemon GO (trading, PvP, mechanics, events, etc) will be touched on briefly or not discussed at all.

The goal of this post is to explore an empty canvas and to quell any FUD about NFTs. There have been a couple of attempts by others to do so, and this writing uses images from a preexisting game to point out parallels and feasibility.

**What does Pokemon GO have to do with GameStop?**

A bit of background information is necessary. But before that, as people here may or may not know, Niantic Labs (the company behind Pokemon GO) is partnered with Gamestop through a sponsorship:

[Power to the players, all caps.](https://preview.redd.it/ftx5tgc4y0j81.png?width=366&format=png&auto=webp&s=580e29d9a3bfa9d321c6a64628e3fd136c10f8ce)

Pokemon GO is a bit different from many other mobile games in that it requires real-world exploration. It is a geolocation based game where you can visit physical GameStop locations and you can collect usable in-game items from visiting certain points of interest or to fight with other players for control of such points of interests (called gyms). It should be noted that very few franchises are partnered with Niantic Labs but GameStop is one of the few that have chosen to “gamify” store visits with Pokemon GO:

[https://www.marketingdive.com/news/gamestop-gamifies-store-visits-with-pokemon-go-activation/588681/](https://www.marketingdive.com/news/gamestop-gamifies-store-visits-with-pokemon-go-activation/588681/)

Here is a link to a Nov 2020 article that goes more into depth; specific details are not important but I figured I would throw it out there. Side note: Nov 2020 was the start of the partnership. An interesting time, to say the least, for GameStop.

Niantic Labs was valued at $4B USD by the end of 2019. Niantic Labs is valued at $9B USD by the end of 2021.  That’s a very rapid valuation and kudos to Niantic Labs. But more importantly to us, imagine companies like this congregating and aggregated into an NFT marketplace umbrella’d under GameStop… that is massive value if a small part of this $9B valuation was attributed to digital assets. Also it should be mentioned that while Niantic Labs is partnered with GameStop, we do not know if there is more to the relationship or what they may or may not do in the future. I am not making any unfounded conjecture.

[Niantic Labs, tech company working on an augmented reality metaverse.](https://preview.redd.it/uijne8u6y0j81.png?width=474&format=png&auto=webp&s=32c426668a33a89b78b4da16d1e841dd416b89a9)

And speaking of geolocation, one of the biggest revenues of Niantic Labs, aside from microtransactions, is through the selling of tickets to events to Safari Zones or GO Fests, where people from around the world are corralled into specific locations to engage in a shared experience of catching pokemon.

The funny thing about Niantic Labs is that they are not a game company. They are a tech company. Niantic Labs’ focus on tech and their declaration of intention to shape the metaverse is partly why I am using Pokemon GO as the primary example for this paper. And more recently, players have questioned the notion that Niantic is getting into the metaverse. What kind of a metaverse does Niantic Labs wish to develop? I don’t know and cannot speculate – but apparently one with a focus on shared experiences and seeing pokemon in the real world via augmented reality blending. This is exciting but outside the scope of this discussion. But if anyone is curious, Niantic Labs wrote a blog about “reality blending” in May 2020 which was largely ignored by everyone (myself included) because we all just want to engage in the game and catch pokemon.

[https:\/\/pokemongolive.com\/post\/realityblending-announcement\/  ](https://preview.redd.it/7se9649ay0j81.png?width=525&format=png&auto=webp&s=823d83c073bcbb3d904ddc6b6a8ca2ce244c7274)

So we have established that GameStop is partnered with a company called Niantic Labs and that Niantic Labs, a company where the products are mobile game-based, is exploring metaverse applications. Now let’s take a look into Niantic’s pokemon offering as it stands today.

**Pokemon GO?** **I thought that game died in 2016.**

The game has evolved and changed quite a bit. If you haven’t played Pokemon GO in a while, there are some new features, goals, and things to do. I won’t be going through too many of the features… only what is relevant to GameStop’s NFT marketplace.

The people who play Pokemon GO, do so avidly. This game is what I refer to as a sandbox game or a “lifestyle” game.  It’s not always meant to be actively played; it can play itself just as you walk with the help of a luxury contraption called a “Pokemon GO Gotcha”. Once you sync it to your phone via bluetooth, you can walk around and the device ambiently starts tossing pokeballs at things you walk by in the real world. It also collects items on your behalf from any points of interests you walk by. Once you are ready to engage in active play (gym battles, raids, PvP, etc), you are already well supplied with the items you need.

[Guess who sells the Gotcha?  Poggers.](https://preview.redd.it/woampmhcy0j81.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=467bcdd816d9ad51806f6d036a88d8349858b337)

This device is sold through two companies: GameStop and Amazon. Amazon has a bunch of counterfeits so if you buy one through them, there is a probability the battery fails after a few weeks. \*cough\*

Whether a player owns a Gotcha or not, people will eventually partake in manual catching of collectible creatures or engage in PvE raids for the chance of catching legendary pokemon or shinies: an alternative color scheme pokemon. Shinies appear at a rate of 1:20 to 1:500 depending on species and is one of the primary dopamine drivers that entice people to play this game almost fanatically. Niantic Labs hosts a wide array of events on certain days that invite player to catch pokemon that are shiny or have special attacks that sends players out in droves every few weekends. More on this later.

And the most amazing thing about the Pokemon GO community… and this is the most important part: people of all ages play this game. There can be a certain non-appeal to CS:GO for older people. Some people dislike PvP games or are frustrated by strategy games. This is a monster collection game where people go out and collect digital assets and make memories while doing so. Most of the people in my Pokemon GO social circle are older, or even retired. It is kind of amazing to see sixteen year olds walking around and enjoying the game alongside seventy year olds.

**How are Pokemon Non-Fungible?**

So we have established that Pokemon in this game are collectible and desirable because of shiny attribute status and the ease of gameplay makes it appealable to any crowd. How does that make these collectible monsters non-fungible?

[Spheal, non-shiny \(left\) and shiny comparison \(right\).  These things bear an uncanny resemblance to one of our mods.  ](https://preview.redd.it/eviby2vey0j81.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=a2caaec2f9c7692f8b8176df9f0f8a5723068ca7)

In this image, I have selected two spheal. At a glance, they look like similar. Do you see what I see? Characteristics. Uniqueness. Attributes.

From these images, I can glean that the two spheal have varying values in five categories:

1. different colors
2. different weight
3. different heights
4. different attacks (body slam vs aurora beam) but this can be changed (some are exclusive to events)
5. different attack, defense, and HP values

Two things drive Pokemon GO players to log in every day and catch some pokemon: shiny colors and different attack, defense, and HP values (called IVs). These IVs vary, from minimum (zero) to maximum (15), and pokemon that have a maximum IV of 15 in all categories (a 1 in 4096 chance) are pretty sought-after.

Past that, pokemon can also have different weights and heights that can make each pokemon individually distinct, which are cool to look at but do not serve critical gameplay elements.

[Power to the creators.  A community-driven competition for Electabuzz and magmar sizes caught during a specific event.  ](https://preview.redd.it/umgykilhy0j81.png?width=623&format=png&auto=webp&s=625a8b233263ed018129e74ee61c8e8aa54e6653)

That being said, some communities have leaders that may opt to create their own game modes, mini-games, and competitions, which is very much in the spirit of metaverse sandbox games (i.e. power to the creators). Here it can be seen that a community has decided to give out server recognition and rewards for having the tallest and fattest electabuzz. This is a community-created monthly competition with no input from Niantic Labs, but the players that play are simply passionate enough to create their own leaderboards and fund the prize pools.

I had mentioned earlier that some pokemon will have special attacks. These exclusive moves are given to pokemon caught or evolved during specific time windows. For example:

* Spheal evolved to walrein on January 15, 2022 will know the attack Powder Snow.
* Bulbasaur evolved to venusaur on January 12, 2022 will know the attack Frenzy Plant.
* Electabuzz evolved to electivire on November 15, 2020 will know the attack Flamethrower.
* Omanyte evolved to omastar in early 2016 could know the attack Rock Slide. (now discontinued)

[Here is a recent example where venusaur learns the limited time move Frenzy Plant.  It is venusaur’s best move and it can only be learned in a specific time window.    ](https://preview.redd.it/tqpjuf9ly0j81.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=b1c8148274a27b2a85e15f571f101d00ba552222)

There is an entire directory of pokemon with special moves or discontinued moves. Some of these attacks are extremely sought after and if a new player does not have it, they need to trade it from someone who does. And as time goes on, the supply of pokemon with these special moves dwindle. This feeds into the idea of digital scarcity. Some things will simply become more valuable with time.

(\*Note, this is a lite description of the system; Niantic has now implemented a way to acquire old moves but it costs time or money to do so with an opportunity of once every few months. For the sake of brevity, I am moving past certain gameplay elements like elite TMs, lucky pokemon, GBL, questing, etc.)

Some pokemon will naturally become very rare or “valuable” because they complete the trifecta of having a special move in addition to having the maximum attack, defense, and HP values, and having the alternative color pallet. This is where the non-fungibility of pokemon attributes arise: my venusaur is different from your venusaur. They can do the same things, but one is more valuable. But here is the caveat today… no matter how valuable any given pokemon is, you do not own the asset. The assets belong to a server on Niantic Labs and you could look at it. But it is not truly yours. If my account is banned, someone steals my account, or I lose access to my account in any way, I no longer have access to this specific venusaur. I can make another account and get another, but it is likely that the five attributes shown above will be different.

NFTs and the marketplace that Immutable X has described is all about owning the asset.  In that regard, every pokemon is like a digitally certified creature that you can own. With GameStop’s NFT Marketplace, a lot of us are hoping players would be able to sell it, trade it, or loan assets to a friend so that they can do better in their raids or PvP battles. All while without going to eBay and violating Niantic Lab’s user terms and service. Another aspect of NFTs is interoperability. In other words – to use that asset in another game, system, or metaverse.  For example, what if this venusaur could follow me into Decentraland? This integrative concept is not solely mine; Robbie Ferguson on the Immutable X interview introduced many of us to the term “interoperable”, which is defined as the ability for computers or systems to exchange and make use of information.

Niantic also has other partnerships which will be briefly touched on later.

**How could minting Pokemon NFTs work?**

Since Immutable X has been brought back into the picture, I want to lightly touch on their collectible card game, Gods Unchained. The premise of the game is very straightforward: it is free-to-play, and as you play, you play-to-earn. You earn cards. If you like the cards, then you can choose to mint and use for deckbuilding. It works on Ethereum Layer2 and one does not have to pay exorbitant fees to start the game. You get a starter deck and can play the game off the block chain.

The next few paragraphs are conjectural but demonstrate that Web3 gaming is easily adaptable and achievable.

For a creature collection game like Pokemon to work, a similar concept to Immutable X’s Gods Unchained could follow suit. Nothing will change about the collection aspect. Players can still catch as many pokemon as they want to their hearts’ delight. But, to use a pokemon for battling in gyms, PvP, raids, NPC battles, a pokemon could be minted. So, if a player were to spend a few hours capturing venusaur during a venusaur event, and they find an venusaur they are very proud of with the attributes they want, they could mint that specific one. Any other venusaur they want to keep and not use could remain in inventory and simply not be minted.

For the sake of making NFTs adaptive and integrated into existing mainstream gameplay paradigms, players need to use the system without knowing that the system involves NFT. This is critical as people have a very negative connotation of what an NFT is. So, call it “registration” instead of minting. In a game like Pokemon GO, you could talk to the professor and select an option that says, “I want to register this pokemon for battles”. And that’s the mint. This will require a fee, let’s say a $Gamecoin token (because I don’t know what to call this universal medium) which is earned through selling something through the GameStop NFT marketplace or received through some other means like a deposit or swap. Perhaps people would be okay with paying a direct deposit for some $Gamecoin knowing that as they play the game, they will find digital assets that they could put on the marketplace and earn as they go. And of course… this is Layer2. So the gas fees for such a transaction would be literally pennies so minting an army of pokemons to use for raids, PvP, and NPC battles would be quite cheap.

(\*Note, there are a lot of DD that discuss Layer2).

[In the context of the Pokemon IP, this could make sense without breaking player immersion.  They pay the $Gamecoin gas fee and the pokemon is seamlessly minted on the blockchain.  One minute later, they are in the battle with their freshly “registered” pokemon.](https://preview.redd.it/wyaovp1py0j81.png?width=489&format=png&auto=webp&s=514405494b5b3230e9a27c8988ba235edd064cf8)

So, in my case, I have a venusaur that I want to register so that I could use it for raid battles. As a first time NFT user, I could be skeeved out by needing to deposit a dollar to get the $Gamecoin required to register. Perhaps I am free-to-play player. However, if I am aware that using the venusaur in raid battles will get me legendaries that I could put on the GameStop NFT Marketplace to not just recoup my dollar but to earn many more dollars, I would be less hesitant to deposit and try. I’m not taking any risks with my dollar – I am playing and earning. That venusaur is now minted and tied to the block chain as a digital asset and I am allowed to use this asset to engage in gyms, PvP, raids, and NPC battles. Hence, I have now been inducted into the NFT environment without ever knowing I am purchasing NFTs.

And then after a few years if I quit Pokemon GO, I could sell the venusaur for a lot more due to asset appreciation: its special move Frenzy Plant has now become scarce.

The $Gamecoin from the sale of this venusaur could be used to fund the next game I wish to play.

**If collectible creatures are on a blockchain as digital assets, value could be intrinsic**

The premise of this speculative piece is that the infrastructure is already laid and in-game assets and random generation of traits for in-game collectibles in many games for consoles, PCs, and mobile. Games such as Pokemon already have randomly assigned attributes and I am using Pokemon GO specifically to demonstrate these attributes in a pre-existing system and how example transitions could occur without being invasive towards gamers. We have also discussed minting, benefits of minting, and how game developers could ease their games to a pre-existing audience who is biased against NFTs. The following will illustrate some further thoughts: that value could be intrinsic and even avatar items could become hot commodities. Microtransactions in current games are highly predatory; watch Immutable X’s Robbie Ferguson interview for his views on microtransactions. It will be a precursor to the discussion here.

[The pokemon known as pikachu.  Yes, it is wearing an event costume from July 2021.  If you didn’t catch one from that event, you must trade for it now.  Scarcity could be a prevalent factor on a blockchain-based game.  ](https://preview.redd.it/ivdojffsy0j81.png?width=145&format=png&auto=webp&s=7eb65b604d8a37f6e3e52e55f3e68c59978db99c)

You will notice that I have now expanded the Pokemon stats screen. As seen before with spheal, every collectible creature will have a slightly different attribute that makes them non-fungible and digitally unique. You will notice that in the bottom, there is a box indicating some additional information. In this case, this costumed pokemon was traded to me. The name of the player who originally caught it (censored), the location where it was caught, which event it was associated with, the day that it was traded to me… are all recorded in the game. What makes Pokemon GO’s system interesting enough to be selected as the primary focus of this paper is that every pokemon’s history is already recorded in the game. In a Web3 environment, these parameters would also all be record on the blockchain. What if the originator of a pokemon was someone famous? There is potentially intrinsic value depending on who is historically associated with this pikachu. Here are some potential situations for heightened intrinsic value:

1. A famous Youtuber or a streamer catches a shiny pokemon with the maximum values of attack, defense, and HP. If this pokemon hits the GameStop NFT marketplace, it would be worth more than another pikachu that is shiny with maximum values of attack, defense, and HP simply due to association. We know this to be true: there is a huge market for collecting cars and other goodies previously owned by celebrities. A lot of followers would be seeking the NFT of this streamer’s pikachu for their own wallets.
2. What if a pokemon competed at a high level tournament and won? Let’s say Pokemon Worlds, the annual global tournament that is sponsored directly by The Pokemon Company. If a competitor uses a pikachu and wins the entire tournament, and that pikachu later shows up on the NFT Marketplace, that would be incredibly exciting and would likely ignite a bidding war. I posit there are many pokemon fans that would like to own the specific pikachu that is recognized to have been the one that launched the attack that won its trainer the Pokemon Worlds 2022 trophy. And their name appearing either in the game or on Etherscan would be akin to having an autographed pikachu.
3. And this is specific to Pokemon GO: the location where a pokemon is caught could also contribute value. A lot of Pokemon Go players are sentimental towards their non-shiny and low stats pokemon because they caught it on a vacation to an exotic location. In a geolocation mobile game, perhaps there would be a market for people looking for Pokemon that originated specifically in Japan.

Collecting pokemon with intrinsic value could open an entire market that is not yet existent. The GameStop SEC Form 8-K filed on February 3, 2022 states the following:

[Gamestop SEC Form 8-K Grant Milestone 4 for Grants to Immutable X](https://preview.redd.it/fmp16cqvy0j81.png?width=623&format=png&auto=webp&s=fdfa3354331d346a787a3adc2b6041352c5cdf7b)

Immutable X is intent on achieving $1.5B in primary and secondary sales if they wish to receive their milestone grant. This can be quite challenging within 24 months and to do so, emergent secondary markets such as intrinsically valuable NFTs could be priced in.

**Pokemon NFTs are cool, but what about vanity and avatar stuff?**

To me, this is actually a bit more exciting than the pokemon themselves because it is applicable to Web3 gaming-at-large.  It was mentioned earlier that Niantic Labs also has partnerships with other companies. That is the fundamental component of the Web3 metaverse internet: collaborations and partnerships.

Niantic Labs has had several high-profile collaborations with several companies, including Samsung, The North Face, Verizon, and Uniqlo. The nature of these collaborations is, to be blunt, rather vapid… there could be so much more value for players. Niantic Lab has had a couple of events for free in-game avatar items that players had to simply log in to receive. Here are some shirts that player avatars can wear:

[In-game shirts from Niantic Labs offers from partnerships from \(left to right\) Samsung, The North Face, Verizon, and Uniqlo.](https://preview.redd.it/sm2ltfy0z0j81.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=30ca0d31ac3993af819e6ca550fd28fe0c654931)

These assets are native to the Niantic server (this is the Web2 way of doing things). Again, we see the same issues as previous, with pokemon: if you lose access to your account, a new account that you make will not have access to these assets. You cannot sell them. They are not stored safely with your wallet… they are not your assets.

Here is one possible way the future of gaming will look like:

[One potential way for cross-promotion and collaborations in the future.  In this system, if this NFT is interoperable with more games, then it is more valuable.  A company may choose to pursue as many collaborations as possible so their NFTs are compatible with more metaverses.](https://preview.redd.it/21z3ohw3z0j81.png?width=434&format=png&auto=webp&s=587f5908a56560b70890b742c4af5a02d5f59fd9)

This crude figure describes one possible flow. Instead of Niantic Labs holding the assets on their server, the asset exists as an NFT in your crypto wallet. When a jacket is purchased at The North Face for an item with an NFT attachment, the NFT can be placed into the crypto wallet. Since The North Face and Niantic Labs are collaborating, it should be stated of course that they are interoperable – the item issued by one company should interface with the other company. In this case, as soon as I connect my phone to Pokemon GO, as this digital asset exists on my wallet, it would be recognized and activated on the Pokemon GO dressing room. In addition, this same NFT could also function and operate in another metaverse – perhaps The North Face has also pursued a collaboration with Decentraland. Or maybe I can sell it on the GameStop NFT market.

The main reason I bring this up is because, as many of us are aware, there is a company called RTFKT, bought by Nike, which is also working with Immutable X. The premise is that Nike sneakers will have something to do with NFTs that can somehow interact with the metaverse. We are in the early stages of Web3, but once a critical mass is achieved, many companies will want to enter this Web3 environment of connectivity and collaboration.

In fact, I would go so far as to say that a mindset will emerge for people who buy physical goods simply to have them for their digital avatars. This is something that will drive sales for many companies so naturally, NFTs simply become mass adopted as a sales tool that benefit all parties involved.

[Who doesn’t want their digital selves to look good when interacting with other players?  In this example, a raid lobby is forming in Pokemon GO.  During this time, I can look at what others are wearing and show off what I am not wearing.  ](https://preview.redd.it/vm5nmzj9z0j81.png?width=340&format=png&auto=webp&s=bccc45dfcb591cd58a5b62b597fcc1a1c3fcac18)

Naturally, everyone profits. If I no longer want this NFT, I drop if off on the GameStop NFT marketplace and recover some $Gamecoin that I can use for another game.

**Closing thoughts and tl;dr**

I remain incredibly optimistic on GME but have found a hard time expressing what NFTs, digital avatars, and the block chain could mean for the future of gaming. I know I am not alone in this. It’s just so… abstract. And there is so much because we are at the very beginning. I found myself needing to write this to get these thoughts onto paper just so that we have something concrete to work with, and to do that, I have examined elements in Pokemon GO to demonstrate how a blockchain game could be feasible and integrated into mass adoption for an existing franchise and the benefits of doing so.

The ideas presented are based off of a preexisting game, but these thoughts and in-game elements are not exclusive to just Pokemon GO, but rather any game, be it PC, console, or mobile with a creature collection aspect developed in the future in conjunction with Immutable X and GameStop.  And again, this speculation is at large using Pokemon GO as a speaking piece to demonstrate how infrastructure and gameplay already exists for block chain interaction.  It’s just easier to use a preexisting game and show the parallels and feasibility. There is also no push for Niantic Labs to enter into a partnership with Immutable X and there is no guarantee any currently existing game will change their current models.

As you read this, I am sure you have had some ideas and insights into how NFT avatar items can be adopted into popular games like Fortnite and League of Legends because you have money tied up in video game skins that cannot be recovered. I don’t know what you play, but some of the concepts here are applicable to pretty much any game.

Robbie Ferguson’s vision includes two major components: interoperability, so different companies can collaborate and share assets, and seamlessness, so that players can interact with NFTs without breaking immersion in the game. This speculative piece puts forward one possible way games will be played in the future while not changing the core of how games are played.

tl;dr:

* GameStop partnered with Niantic Labs, which is dabbling in the metaverse, back in Nov 2020 but the partnership is likely peripheral
* the gaming elements, in-game assets, and random generation of traits for in-game collectibles in many games for consoles, PCs, and mobile already exist
* Using Immutable X, players should be able to mint quickly and cheaply to have assets that will allow them to acquire more assets
* Non-disruptive to current gaming paradigm: if a player chooses to collect creatures and not mint them for battles, they can do so. The free-to-play model therefore remains
* The model should be “play and earn” and not “play to earn”. The gameplay is the focus. A player’s immersion should not be interrupted by the minting process and other NFT backend tech
* We examine a use case about why players would choose to mint a venusaur with variable attributes and event-specific special attacks. If player quits, they can sell this appreciated asset later down the road to fund assets in another game
* Intrinsic value. If DFV puts his meowth on the GameStop NFT market… I want it. And so do many other people. This generates value for the ecosystem
* Avatar items are a huge market… people want to look good!  But the way they are stored in centralized databases means little value for players
* Collaboration between companies give players the power to collect, use, and sell assets while incentivizing interoperability with as many other companies as possible
* An emergent secondary digital marketplace is in line with GameStop’s vision
* Pokemon GO illustrates all of GameStop’s NFT platform tenets: power to the players/creators/collectors

The Merge will be the biggest halving until the date,"Every 4 years all people go nuts with Bitcoin halving because historically, a bullrun happens after it, but I don’t see anybody so excited for the halving aspect from the Ethereum Merge, which IMO will have even more impact, so I’ll explain it.

# Rewards

Right now, Bitcoin gives 6.25 btc each 10 minutes to miners, that’s ~38M$ each day.

Ethereum gives 2 eth to miners each 13 seconds, that’s also ~38M$ daily, so miner rewards from both networks are almost the same.

# The Merge

The Merge will change the rewards, those 2 eth per block are removed, and 1370 eth are given to validators daily. That’s 4M$, that’s right, almost 10 times less from the initial 38M$ figure.

To put this into perspective, a Bitcoin halving right now, would reduce rewards from 38M$ daily, to 19M$ daily, while the ethereum’s merge halving will reduce rewards from 38M$ daily to 4M$ daily

The Merge is also planned to happen this summer, and if you’re following the merge development, you know that this will probably happen on time, as the teams are deploying the hopefully final testnet 5 months before the deadline.

So in conclusion, after the Merge we will see the biggest halving until now in all crypto space (it doesn’t make sense to call it halving, as it’s not the half, more like the Tenthing or idk, english is not my first language). Where’s the hype?

Edit: Some of the comments called this *The decimation*

Edit2: apparently someone pointed that decimation it’s used to say that just the 10% of the amount it’s removed, so I guess it’s the opposite, someone knows how’s called when you kill the 90% of the amount?",546.0,2022-02-14 11:40:26,0.92

**Frequently Asked Questions**

**Where's the best place to buy ETH?**

There are many centralized exchanges that support Ethereum. If you live in the US, the most popular exchanges are Coinbase, Gemeni and Kraken. Coinbase users can use Coinbase Pro for lower fees.

**When is Eth2 launching?**

Eth2 is a marketing term used to represent a number of updates to Ethereum. The Eth2 proof-of-stake chain first launched in December 2020. ""The Merge"", which is the event that will fully switch Ethereum's consensus to proof-of-stake, is estimated to be ready in early 2022, although there is no exact timeline. Other updates, such as data shards, will follow that update.

Visit [ethmerge.com](https://ethmerge.com/) to learn more about ""The Merge"".

**Do I need to do anything to update to Eth2? Will Eth2 create a new token?**

No, ETH holders *never* need to take any action to keep holding ETH. Ethereum users will be unaffected by the Eth2 upgrade. And the Eth2 updates will not create any new tokens.

**How can I stake my ETH?**

There are two ways that you can stake your ETH: by running your own validator, or providing your ETH to a staking pool.

* Running your own validator requires a modern computer and 32 ETH. Visit /r/ethstaker for more details
* Staking pools accept any amount of ETH. We recommend [Lido](https://lido.fi/) or [StakeWise](https://stakewise.io/)

**Why are Ethereum transaction fees so high?**

Like most blockchains, Ethereum fees are determined by supply-and-demand. The large demand to use Ethereum has pushed transaction fees quite high (however, fees were just a few cents only 2 years ago). Fees are especially high during market volatility, and during NFT drops.

**What is being done to lower Ethereum transaction fees?**

Ethereum fees are reduced by using layer-2 rollups. Rollups are scaling solutions that allow for significantly cheaper transactions, while still maintaining Ethereum's security.

Additionally, Eth2's data shards will make rollups even cheaper.

While rollups are cutting-edge technology being actively developed, a number are already live on Ethereum mainnet. Visit [l2beat.com](https://l2beat.com/) to learn more about rollups.

**What's the best wallet for Ethereum?**

The most popular tool for using decentralized applications is Metamask. However, for security reasons, we recommend using a hardware wallet such as a Trezor or Ledger.

Blockchain and Cryptocurrency – A complete beginners guide,"**What is a blockchain?**

It is an “immutable ledger.” Think about it like a book that lives in the sky. Every time something changes, it’s written down with magic ink, that when dries, never changes. And there are thousands of copies of these books, all getting updated at the same time. If one is ever messed with, the other books would wipe out the problem and replace it with the correct entry.

**What is proof of Work?**

First generation crypto currency worked of the concept of Poof of work. There, it is a race to solve a complicated math puzzle, and perform the block write operation. And as a reward get coin. “Mining.” Mining is slow. Bitcoin can only do 7 transactions a minute.

Of the thousands and thousands of machines out there racing to win the next block, only 1 at a time wins. That means the others have literally wasted their energy via compute CPU and GPU cycles. Bitcoin used more energy than Argentina last year.  
But it’s not all bad. POW is still the oldest and most battle tested consensus algorithm, and many agues more secure because of it. Also, miner contend that, as an industry, it can actually help the power grid. They consume when demand is low, ensuring the power quotas are met, and are even willing to turn off machines to conserve energy when needed. Like was the case recently in Texas.

**What is proof of Stake?**

Proof of Stake works on different types of newly developed “Consensus” algorithms. Ouroboros protocol, created by IOG and Cardano, along with a team of PHDs and mathematicians, is the first of its kind. They created a secure “lottery” consensus mechanism to “elect” the next “slot leader” to write the block. Here each Stake pool can get a chance to be elected by winning the lottery. Each Ada coin represents 1 lottery ticket. When you delegate to the pool, you give that pool your ticket, not your coin. If the pool wins, you get the reward along with everyone in the pool, and the operator. Because there is no more complicated math puzzle, and no more computers racing to solve the puzzle, its much much faster, and much much cheaper. Cardano nodes run on minimal hardware .. A lot of nodes out there run on Solar energy. It’s so good, Ethereum, who is proof of work currently, is moving to this model as part of their ETH 2.0 migration. Hopefully this summer with the ""merge."" In efforts to become more energy efficient. Pokodot created its own Consensus algorithm. Called Grandpa. Tezos has its Emmy+, and the list goes on.

Its important to note that each chain has their own way of doing things.  
Some require you to lock up your stake.  
Others implement punishment controls, like slashing.  
Whatever options they choose; the choices are typical driven by how the founders believe they can best secure and scale the chain.

What you should remember is that for both POW, POS, and others, they are all a means of incentivizing the actual people that run the computers hosting the blockchain code. Without them, there is no “decentralized network of immutable ledgers.” Which is because that’s just fancy talk for machines running our code to support the blockchain.

**What is Market Cap and coin supply and why should we care?**

Market Capitalization is equal to Price of Coin times Supply of Coin. That is, it. But very important.

BITCOIN has a fixed supply. It is not all mined yet. Not until 2140. But it does have a finite amount, 21 Million.

Here is why you can see a 65K or even 100K bitcoin, but you’ll probably never see a 100 dollar DOGE, or even a 30 Dollar Ada (not soon anyway)

Currently there are 18,929,200 BTC out there at a cost of 43,087.16.

That means, the market cap is 43,087.16 x 18,929,200 = 815,605,469,072 (815B)

Cardano, has a fixed coin supply as well. But it is 45 Billion. There are currently 33,526,814,681. So you see the max is 2500x more. Likewise, with 130B DOGE vs 18M BTC - it’s \~6700X more. DogeCoin also makes 10,000 new coins a minute.

At a price is 1.26 that means the market cap for Cardano is 1.26 X 33,526,814,681 = 42,243,786,498.06 (42B)

You’ll need 136B market cap to reach a 1-dollar DOGE in the next year.

132,670,764,300 + ((10,000\*60\*24\*351) = 137,725,164,300 (Supply of DOGE in 1 year from now)  
137,725,164,300 \* 1 = 137,725,164,300

You'll need an almost 1 Trillion Market Cap for Cardano to hit 3032,127,627,594 \* 30 = 963,828,827,820

To give you some reference. Here is the Market cap of some big names.

Visa – 499B

Adobe – 250B

Amazon – 1.7T

It’s very confusing because every coin has their own supply. Their own way of creating coins and at what cadence. Some even “burn” coins. So, know what yours does and how it works.

**How can I “get in early?”**

First. We are all early. You might not have gotten in on the first floor, but we’re only halfway up the stairs to the second flight.

Global wealth is estimated at 1 quadrillion. All the Market Cap in crypto is at 2.05 Trillion. That’s only 0.21% of the world’s wealth.

When looking for “what could be the next big thing” find something with a low market cap, regardless of coin price, that has a strong chance of doing well because of team and tech, the two Ts.

Also ask yourself.

What are these coins use cases?  
Who is their target audience for adoption?  
Who is funding them?  
Who is their team building it? What is their history?  
Do they have a good plan?

[https://river.com/learn/how-much-worlds-money-in-bitcoin/#:\~:text=Global%20wealth%20is%20estimated%20at,represents%200.09%25%20of%20global%20wealth](https://river.com/learn/how-much-worlds-money-in-bitcoin/#:~:text=Global%20wealth%20is%20estimated%20at,represents%200.09%25%20of%20global%20wealth).

**What are your goals?**

Crypto is really split into 4 worlds.

Day traders, H.O.D.L.’ers, Whales, and weak hands.

Day traders realize that this market is very volatile, now, and historically. Good ones, can capitalize on quick gains by buying low and selling high, waiting for a dip, then buying back in, and selling high again, cyclically.

Then there are those that “Hold On for Dear Life.” These people tend to find something they really are passionate about, and never sell. They keep buying. If they see their coin dips, below at what they bought it at, and have some extra funds, they buy more, to ""Average Down."" Or Dollar cost average (DCA) by buying a set amount on a regular cadence. They only “take profit” buy selling a small portion when price is really high.

Whales, are investors that come in with millions and billions of dollars. They often “test” the market buy either buying or dumping millions and billions in hopes to manipulate the market to their advantage. If you’re reading this, you’re probably not in this category, but you should know they exist and effect this marketplace.

Then there are “weak hands.” Do not pick this one. These people buy high and sell low. They only invest based on emotion, and nothing else. When things start going bad, they panic, and sell at a loss. It’s much better to let your coin go to .000000001 cents, and just hold on to it in the hopes of a rally years later, then it is to ever sell at a loss. Never do this. Never.

Each has its own risks and rewards.

Day trading can rack up dollars quick, but you can lose them just as quick. And there are tax implicates with trades. Some unknown, and constantly changing.

HODL, might take years, but if you do, the chance of your Return on Invest improves significantly in crypto.

Pick what works best for you but have a plan.

**What is the difference between storing on an exchange or in a wallet?**

A lot.

First, you must remember what the dream of crypto is really offering.  
Its offering a way for us to break away from banks. Forever.  
Centralized banks that can print money, is a problem. Blockchain solves this.  
But not if the new bank ends up being Binace or Coinbase. In fact, keeping your coin in exchanges puts us all at risk of market manipulation by them.  
When a certain 1 person or group owns too many nodes, they can make choices that would benefit them. The attack vector is called a 51% attack or sybil attack.  
Today however, you need exchanges to on ramp and off ramp FIAT. FIAT money is government-issued currency that is not backed by a physical commodity, such as gold or silver.

But it will not be like that forever. Chains like ADA and DOT will be interoperable with legacy banks and will eventually cut out exchanges.

Personally, I despise BNB coin and binace. They already take high fees, and now they want the control and the rewards too. Coinbase isn’t much better. Again though, a necessary evil, for now.

But more important than the “dream” is that they can be hacked.

They are a website. Not a blockchain. They hold the keys to your wallet, and let you use them with a weak password and no mfa if you like. Its literally like storing your money in a bank. So know your bank. Good thing, like a bank, SOME, are federally insured up to a certain amount. But some are not, and people have lost millions and billions in the past this way.

Also, there is the notification of “passive income” and “interest.”

With POS systems, delegators are incentivized to “stake” their coin by earning interest.

With POW systems, like bitcoin, you’d have to stand up your own machine, configure it, and let it use your energy in your house. With coins like Cardano Ada, and ETH 2.0, you can now pull your coin off the exchange, put it in a wallet, delegate to a pool, and earn interest. All while maintaining full control of your coins.

Lastly, as someone pointed out in a previous post, you should remember that you coin is really in neither the exchange nor your “wallet.” Your coin is in the blockchain.  
An Exchange and a “wallet” are really just User Interfaces to interact with the blockchain.

The main difference between your own wallet, and an exchange, is who owns the “private key.” Without going to deep into asymmetric key pairs, just know that your “key” allows you to access your coins. And just like the key to your house, you should keep it safe yourself, and not let just anyone hold onto it.

**What are Smart Contracts? (This one will blow your mind if you are a developer)**

First let us start with what most people say.

“Smart contracts are self-executing contracts with the terms of the agreement between buyer and seller being directly written into lines of code.”

Which is true for sure. It helps build trust and removes the cumbersome third party “trusted agent” like a bank.

But what smart contracts really are is “ANY Code” that can be written to a blockchain and NEVER be changed, forever.

ANY CODE. You can write your own coins and put them into the block. It happens a lot.

Games, sure, put in the chain. The first was CryptoKitties.

In the future ALL business will be blockchain businesses. Every transaction, every process in the building and distribution, will be written to a magic book that can’t be messed with. Ever..

**What are Oracles?**

The Oracle is a charter in the matrix that bakes cookies.  
No… not that Oracle..

Oracles, are trusted third parties that provide off chain information for on chain smart contracts.  
Basic smart contracts may not need oracles at all. They can simple execute based on a set of conditions. “Sell NFT to user if user buys NFT.”

But say for example you want to create a smart contract travel insurance.  
The contract could say, “If the weather in Bora Bora is bad on the day of travel, it will refund the travel and allow you to book at a later date.”

But how could the smart contract know what the weather is. Answer, Oracles.

…. There is no spoon

**What are NFTs?**

NonFungible Tokens is metadata attached to an asset.

The metadata is things like who created it, and when. Along with the most important piece the link to the asset.

The asset is what most people think of when they talk about NFTs.  
Its a digital file. Like a jpg or a mov file.  
But its not stored in the blockchain like most assume.  
Instead they are stored, most often, in IPFS storage.  
IPFS is very cool, but its not blockchain, and thus not ""immutable.""

So what’s the big deal? I can upload a gif to the internet today.

The big deal is twofold.

First, you are not uploading anything to the “internet.” That whole thing we call the internet is flawed. Tracked, centralized, monitored, and gated.  
What you are doing is creating an EARLY entry, in a book that will never change for the rest of time.  
Let us sit and think about that for a second.  
De Beers is going to have to get new slogan. “A ~~diamond~~ NFT is forever”  
Right now, it is some awful GIF of a dogecoin. But it is not what it is. It is what it represents.  
It is the next chapter in Art history. What is created will last longer than the Mona Lisa. Someday you will have blockchain archaeologist that comb though chains.

Plus, taking away the cool factor, they create a place that you can now prove you did it first.

Artist could upload lyrics as an NFT, and later sell them, without the fear their art might be stolen before a contract is in place. People could attach their house deed to a chain, and never again dispute who owns the land after a conflict.

NFTs are frequently used to sell a wide range of virtual collectibles, including NBA virtual trading cards, music, digital images, video clips and even virtual real estate in [Decentraland](https://decentraland.org/), a virtual world.

That of course is the rosier outlook on NFTs.

Unfortunately, in practice there are many gaps today.

The first I already mentioned. The asset is not stored in the blockchain.  
What that means is that the IPFS provider could ""unpin"" your asset, and if it’s not saved anywhere else, you'll end up with an NFT that has metadata that points to a url that has nothing there.

The second problem is that there are thousands of blockchains. People can take your asset, because its publicly pined, and then go create an NFT on another blockchain, and then claim theirs is in fact the original. You'd have to check every chain that supports NFTs to ensure it was in fact the first first.

Or people have taken hard artwork, like paintings, and then minted and sold them as NFTs.

**What is the metaverse?**

Hmm… well… no one really knows what this thing is or what it will be really.

The ones building it, and investing into it, seem to think it’s the start of Halliday OASIS in Ready Player one.

A place where you can “jack in” using virtual reality and walk around a virtual world. And inside this virtual world would be services that you can buy and utilize.

Shopping for new cloths? Head over to the Versace Mansion and virtually try somethings on. Then order and have an Amazon drone drop it off hours later.

Getting hungry after all that shopping, and spent too much already?  
Stop by for a quick byte at McDonalds, order, and have doordash drop it off.

Or maybe you want to have a virtual party house on a popular part of the map. Buy some virtual land!

At a technical level the metaverse is really an interface and the utilization of NFTs on a particular blockchain.

Take for example Decentraland. Its built on Ethereum.  
Or Blocktopia, which is built on Poloygon.

So its not really “one” metaverse, but really a collection of different applications creating virtual worlds in order to entice you to spend time, and eventually purchase good and services.

**What is a Dex?**

If you’re here, you’re likely familiar with what a Centralized Exchange is. Its something like Coinbase or Kracken. Essentially, they are off chain stores to buy and trade cryptocurrencies.

A Dex, is a Decentralized Exchange.  
It does the same thing of allowing users to buy and sell coins, but the code that makes the application function is all written with on chain smart contracts.

There are a couple key benefits of Dexs.  
The first is that many don’t require that cumbersome Know Your Customer (KYC) details. You can just link a wallet, send in some other crypto, and start trading for different tokens.  
The second is that many tokens aren’t listed on centralized exchanges, and can only be traded on a Dex.

Be careful though, because it doesn’t have KYC and has many new coins, they are havens for scammers.

**What is a Dapp?**

A true Dapp is a decentralized application. Decentralized because all the code is written to smart contracts that live on the chain, and thus on each node running the software distributed worldwide.

In practice, there are lots Centralized applications out that that still run “off chain” code, and hold valuable information server side, and then just write some things to the chain.

**What is DeFi?**

Decentralized Finance (DeFi) is a growing group of financial tools built on a blockchain. These tools are open for anyone to use; all you need is a wallet address and some Coin. These tools span a range of uses that let users trade crypto-tokens, take out a loan, cast a vote, and even sell art. Since these tools follow a set of standards, users can combine operations across different protocols. For example, you can build a chain of transactions where you borrow money, make a profitable trade, and repay the loan -- all instantaneously.

**What is a DAO?**

DAO stands for decentralized autonomous organization. Simply put, DAOs are communities of people who share the same interests, work on the same projects or in similar industries, or hold the same beliefs. The company you work for, the public corporation you hold stock in — hell, even your church and the country you live in — could all be DAOs!

The difference between DAOs and these other organizations is that DAOs are built on a blockchain. Just as the Boy Scouts have handbooks, corporations and churches have governance laws, and countries have governments and constitutions, DAOs have smart contracts that are coded on the blockchain.

**Can you break down some of these Acronyms?**

**HODL** = is a term derived from a misspelling of ""hold,"" in the context of buying and holding Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. It's also commonly come to stand for ""hold on for dear life"" among crypto investors. The term HODL (or hodl) originated in 2013 with a post to the Bitcointalk forum.  
**Hopium** = Represents the belief that the situation will someday improve.  
**FOMO** = Fear of Missing Out  
**FUD** = Fear, Uncertainty, and Doubt  
**Bear**/**Bearish** = ""Bears"" believe that an asset, for example a digital currency, will decline in value.  
**Bull**/**Bullish** = If a trader believes that an asset will rise in value, he or she is a ""bull.""  
**DYOR** = Do your own research

**What is a “Pump and Dump?”**

This is when a person, or likely group of people, buy up some low market cap coin, and then hype it, typically on social media, wait for the price to get to the target, and then sell everything they bought.

[https://www.foolproofme.org/articles/864-major-crypto-scams-explained-pump-and-dump-vs-rug-pull](https://www.foolproofme.org/articles/864-major-crypto-scams-explained-pump-and-dump-vs-rug-pull)

**What is a “Rug pull?”**

Similar to a pump and dump, the idea is to get the price up, then bail.

Unlike a pump and dump, a rug pull refers to those creating new coins, they hyping them, and then bailing. This happens just as much as pump and dumps, and can easily be avoided by ensuring you DYOR.

How do I avoid losing your coins, by mistake, or from being scammed?

Make sure you keep your seed phrases safe. If your computer crashes, or you lose your phone, you’ll have to recreate your wallet using your seed phrase. There are tons of stories out there about people losing access to their accounts. That’s really the double edge sword of cryptography, and currency tied to it, in its current state. The security is so good, that you can’t crack it. You can try to brute force it, and some have gotten lucky, but typically, if you lose your seed phrase, and access to your wallet, you’ve “burned” your coins.

Don’t watch youtube for cryptocurrency advise. I have channel, I try to put out educational content, and there are some that are ok, but for 99% of them, they are trying to use you to make money. Their whole business model for them to profit, is for you to do what they say. They pump you full of hopium, and then run off with your bags. Today, you need to really try to do as much research on your own as you can. Read lots of articles, from both perspectives, then make up your own mind.

Don’t talk to anyone that approaches you on social media about investing.

This goes back to “never talk to strangers.”  
Far to often scammers will reach out to you on Facebook or Instagram and start a friendly conversation. They could even appear to be a sexy female/male looking to just be friends… and the next thing you know they are telling you how much money they made in crypto… and all you have to do is send your 450K worth of ETH to this brand new DiFe liquidity pool. Next thing you know you can’t get access to your funds, and they are asking for an additional 50K. Which is exactly what happened to someone I consulted with recently.

**Do your own research (DYOR)**. There are now more then 4K types of cryptocurrencies. You can create your own in about 30 minutes with the right free tools.

The mortality rate of new coins is super high this year. Lots of scam coins.

**What are some famous names in crypto?**

1. **Satoshi Nakamoto** – This isn’t actually a real person, but a **pseudonym** the **BITCOIN** whitepaper, Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System, was published in. So we really don’t know who this person is. It could be the CIA or many think, Adam Back.
2. **Adam Back** – This guy invented **HashCash** back in 1997 and is the CEO of **Blockstream** today. Back was born in London, England, in July 1970. His first computer was a Sinclair ZX81. He taught himself Basic, and spent his time reverse engineering video games, finding decryption keys in software packages. He completed his A levels in advanced mathematics, physics and economics. He has a computer science PhD in distributed systems from the University of Exeter. He was only one of the first two people to receive emails from “Satoshi” and worked on **Bitcoin** in the early days.
3. **Nick Szabo** \- Nicholas ""Nick"" Szabo is a computer scientist, legal scholar, and cryptographer known for his research in digital contracts and digital currency. He graduated from the University of Washington in 1989 with a degree in computer science and received a law degree from George Washington University Law School. He holds an honorary professorship at the Universidad Francisco Marroquín. The phrase and concept of ""**smart contracts**"" was developed by Szabo with the goal of bringing what he calls the ""highly evolved"" practices of contract law and practice to the design of electronic commerce protocols between strangers on the Internet.
4. **Vitalik Buterin** – Co-Founder of **Ethereum,** this man was only 19 when he first wrote his whitepaper. His concepts brought to life smart contracts for the first time. While in grade three of elementary school in Canada, Buterin was placed into a class for gifted children and was drawn to mathematics, programming, and economics. Buterin then attended the Abelard School, a private high school in Toronto and learned about Bitcoin, from his father, at the age of 17. He also co-founding Bitcoin Magazine in 2011. Also know for his philanthropy.
5. **Gavin Wood -** **Dr**. Gavin James Wood is an English computer scientist, co-founder of **Ethereum** and creator of **Polkadot** and **Kusama.** Wood was born in Lancaster, England, United Kingdom.

He attended Metropolitan State University of Denver and University of Colorado Boulder to study analytic number theory. In 2013 Hoskinson quit a consulting job to begin a project called the Bitcoin Education Project. Hoskinson joined the Ethereum founding team (one of eight original founders) with Vitalik Buterin in late 2013. Hoskinson was approached by former Ethereum colleague Jeremy Wood to form a new project called IOHK (Input Output Hong Kong), an engineering and research company that builds cryptocurrencies and blockchains.
7. **Silvio Micali** \- Born October 13, 1954 is an Italian computer scientist, professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and the founder of **Algorand**. Micali's research centers on cryptography and information security. In 2007, Micali was elected a member of the National Academy of Engineering for contributions to modern cryptography, through the development of zero-knowledge protocols and the theory of pseudo-randomness. In 2012, he received the **Turing Award** for his work in cryptography.

Transactions fees will be immediately available to validators after the merge,"After the merge, transaction fees will be given to validators instead of miners. Those fees will be liquid and immediately available to validators in an Ethereum account.

The rewards for proposing a block will accrue on your validator like they currently are, but the fees from the transactions within that block will be given to the validator and usable right way. You should be able to configure an Ethereum account address with your client to choose where those fees will go.

Great news for people who want immediate and liquid compensation for running a validator. You will still be at the mercy of the randomness of proposing blocks and the randomness of fees within the different blocks. Some blocks have more fees than others.",89.0,2022-02-11 14:28:11,0.99

**Frequently Asked Questions**

**Where's the best place to buy ETH?**

There are many centralized exchanges that support Ethereum. If you live in the US, the most popular exchanges are Coinbase, Gemeni and Kraken. Coinbase users can use Coinbase Pro for lower fees.

**When is Eth2 launching?**

Eth2 is a marketing term used to represent a number of updates to Ethereum. The Eth2 proof-of-stake chain first launched in December 2020. ""The Merge"", which is the event that will fully switch Ethereum's consensus to proof-of-stake, is estimated to be ready in early 2022, although there is no exact timeline. Other updates, such as data shards, will follow that update.

Visit [ethmerge.com](https://ethmerge.com/) to learn more about ""The Merge"".

**Do I need to do anything to update to Eth2? Will Eth2 create a new token?**

No, ETH holders *never* need to take any action to keep holding ETH. Ethereum users will be unaffected by the Eth2 upgrade. And the Eth2 updates will not create any new tokens.

**How can I stake my ETH?**

There are two ways that you can stake your ETH: by running your own validator, or providing your ETH to a staking pool.

* Running your own validator requires a modern computer and 32 ETH. Visit /r/ethstaker for more details
* Staking pools accept any amount of ETH. We recommend [Lido](https://lido.fi/) or [StakeWise](https://stakewise.io/)

**Why are Ethereum transaction fees so high?**

Like most blockchains, Ethereum fees are determined by supply-and-demand. The large demand to use Ethereum has pushed transaction fees quite high (however, fees were just a few cents only 2 years ago). Fees are especially high during market volatility, and during NFT drops.

**What is being done to lower Ethereum transaction fees?**

Ethereum fees are reduced by using layer-2 rollups. Rollups are scaling solutions that allow for significantly cheaper transactions, while still maintaining Ethereum's security.

Additionally, Eth2's data shards will make rollups even cheaper.

While rollups are cutting-edge technology being actively developed, a number are already live on Ethereum mainnet. Visit [l2beat.com](https://l2beat.com/) to learn more about rollups.

**What's the best wallet for Ethereum?**

The most popular tool for using decentralized applications is Metamask. However, for security reasons, we recommend using a hardware wallet such as a Trezor or Ledger.

Add Second Hard Drive To Existing Ethereum Validator To Avoid Full Disk - Easy Guide,"I followed the u/SomerEsat guide to setup a validator on an Ubuntu machine over a year ago with a 1TB SSD hard drive. Since then pruning geth every few months has kept the chain data under 1TB but the inevitable is coming. I initially considered using something like clonezilla to completely clone the 1TB drive to a new 2TB one but was worried about something going wrong.

I found an easier solution of simply adding a second hard drive to the existing file system and then copying the `goethereum` folder with all the geth chain data over to the new 2TB drive. This method takes < 1 hour and the only change to the original configuration is the `--datadir` in the geth config file.

I wanted to share the steps that worked for me with the community since I haven't seen anyone post a good solution to the problem many are facing of running out of disk space. If you were able to follow SomerEsat's guide you should be able to do this.

&#x200B;

WARNING: These steps worked for me but may not work for you. Use at your own risk, I am not responsible for any mistakes that may cause damage or loss.

&#x200B;

1. Acquire a second >= 2TB hard drive and SATA cable, shut down your machine and connect it. (there should be 2 hard drives connected now)
2. Boot up the machine and stop geth, validator, beacon, rocketpool services.
3. Run `ls /dev/sd*` and you should see the new drive listed as something like `/dev/sdb` (original is `/sda`)
4. Use `fdisk` to make a new Linux partition on the new disk with the following commands `fdisk /dev/sdb` then `p for partition -> enter for default first cylinder -> enter for default last cylinder -> w to write it` there's a step by step guide here: [https://www.techotopia.com/index.php/Adding\_a\_New\_Disk\_Drive\_to\_an\_Ubuntu\_Linux\_System](https://www.techotopia.com/index.php/Adding_a_New_Disk_Drive_to_an_Ubuntu_Linux_System)
5. Now we need to format the new partition `mkfs.ext4 /dev/sdb1` (make sure this is the *new* partition likely ending in ""b1"")
6. Create a new mounting point for the new partition `sudo mkdir /new-drive` (you can name the `new-drive` whatever you want but make sure to update all other commands)
7. Manually mount the new filesystem `sudo mount /dev/sdb1 /new-drive`
8. We're going to add configuration to the fstab file to automatically mount the new filesystem after reboot. First get the UUID of your new filesystem.
9. Run `blkid` then look for the UUID on the new `/dev/sdb1` drive
10. Now add that UUID to the fstab file `sudo nano /etc/fstab` and then add a new line under the existing one that has the root `/` mount point. It should look like: `UUID=""YOUR_NEW_DISK_UUID_HERE"" /new-drive ext4 errors=remount-ro 0 1`
11. Copy all the chain data over to the new drive (this will take 15-20 min) `sudo cp -R -i /var/lib/goethereum/ /new-drive`
12. Assign the new directory permissions to goeth `sudo chown -R goeth:goeth /new-drive/goethereum`
13. Update geth service to use the new drive `sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/geth.service` and then  replace  `--datadir /var/lib/goethereum` with `--datadir /new-drive/goethereum`
14. Reload systemd to reflect changes and start geth `sudo systemctl daemon-reload` \--> `sudo systemctl start geth`
15. Check the status of geth, then restart validator, beacon & rocketpool services
16. Wait a bit to let geth and the beaconchain catch up and make sure your new configuration is working properly.
17. Once you're happy with the new drive, you can delete the chain data on original hard drive `sudo rm -R /var/lib/goethereum`

&#x200B;

That's it! Now your validator should have disk space to get us to The Merge and beyond! I hope this was helpful and happy to answer any questions if I can. Also would appreciate anyone to point out any potential problems with this configuration of using 2 SSD's or ways this setup process could be improved.",43.0,2022-02-06 21:47:04,0.99
The flippening: what’s Loopring’s/L2 role? (ELI12 Long-read edition),"So, I have been interested for a while now in The Flippening, but I never really dove into it. For all of you who don’t know what the flippening is: it’s the theory that Ethereum exceeds Bitcoin market cap. In the past we have seen a very dominant Bitcoin (95% marketcapshare) however, right now Ethereum has appr. Half of Bitcoins marketcap due to a huge increase of Ethereum’s use/popularity. Without hanging on to this too much, Bitcoin has 60% of the total marketcap, Ethereum 30% and the rest are either stablecoins or other Alts (such as Loopring). I will try to explain how/what Ethereum is and where Loopring comes into play. Feel free to correct me, I have done some basic research and Im by no means a technical guy. I start of with the price development of Eth, explain a bit about gas-prices and then finish with Loopring's role.

# Ethereum’s price development

In February 2019 Ethereum was sitting at appr. 131 USD. In February 2020 Ethereum was sitting at 229 USD. From September 2020 untill November 2021 Ethereum has had a surge in it’s price to a whopping 4400 USD, which has settled until now, February 2021 at around 2695 USD. Of course. This price development was caused by an enormous increase in popularity of Defi projects, the innovative pace of the platform and the way in which it solves existing problems (energy waste, using proof-of-stake. We already established that the price surge goes hand in hand with an increase in popularity/use, but we can also see that this results in higher gas-fees. A gas fee is explained as follows:

>“Gas” refers to the fee required to successfully conduct any transaction on Ethereum. The fee goes directly to Ethereum miners who provide the computer power that's necessary to verify transactions and keep the network running.

How is the gas-price calculated? It’s calculated in **gwei**, which you probably heard of. 1 gwei = 0.000000001 ETH. Every transaction to make on the ETH network cost a fixed amount of gwei + a variable amount of gwei. A bunch of transactions are packed into a block. These blocks have a size, depending on the amount of transactions that are packed into it. [If the network activity goes up, so does the blocksize and so does the base fee and variable fees](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/gas/#base-fee)**.** This would mean: the more popular the Ethereum network becomes and people use it, the higher the blocks are to compute the transactions, the higher the base fees and variable fees become. The fees are calculated as a % of the value of Ethereum. So there is always a direct correlation between the gas fees and the price of Ethereum. On top, the fees are an essential part of keeping the network secure. You can also leave a tip, so a miner has an incentive to make your transaction happen before others, but I will leave that out of this story for now too.  I will leave the update of the Ethereum network out of it too, but if you want to read more, there is a lot to read on [www.ethereum.org](http://www.ethereum.org/). This is, for all you visual people, what a block looks like:

[Transactions via a \\""Block\\""](https://preview.redd.it/dyvcxsytf8g81.png?width=1080&format=png&auto=webp&s=e0bd65fc799b934b056b334983fa6b415e639b1f)

# Loopring enters the stage

We can conclude a few things from the above:

1. Ethereum surged in the past 1,5 year
2. Ethereum has a real use-case
3. The use-case get’s more expensive when used more more often

Now this is nothing I can back by science, only by common sense, but there is a limit to which people are willing to go to use a network if it means a higher % of fee out of their pocket. With increased popularity the rope around the neck of Ethereum becomes tighter for smaller smart-contract transactions. Ethereum is set to address these problems via various updates, fi. with [“The Merge”](https://ethereum.org/en/upgrades/merge/) which is set to Q2 this year and especially [“Shar~~t~~d Chains”](https://ethereum.org/en/upgrades/shard-chains/) . While The Merge is expected to do nothing to gas-fees, “Shard Chains” is expected to reduce the fees, however this is only implemented in 2023. If youre interested in reading an interesting take, click [here](https://coinyuppie.com/gas-fees-will-not-be-reduced-after-ethereum-is-converted-to-pos-and-sharding-and-l2-are-required-to-get-rid-of-the-noble-chain/).

The current gas price for a single current transaction with normal transaction speed is around 30$, but there were times where a transaction could [cost around 60 to 100 USD](https://coingeek.com/the-ridiculously-high-cost-of-gas-on-ethereum/). Ask yourself: if you could do the same with a normal bank-transfer with 1/10th of the costs, would you use the Ethereum network? No you wouldn’t, no matter how much we dislike banks, we're not a thief of our own wallet.

Here comes the L2 into place. If Ethereum wants to keep growing, L2 is a necessity. Big transactions that are met with a 100USD can be considered if you're making large transactions, but if you are a retailer/small guy making small transactions, it will only be viable via L2. This is where mass adoption is allowed to take place. We have already seen the current transaction costs in a post this week [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/loopringorg/comments/sl91sn/loopring_is_killing_it_with_lowest_fees_i_am_in/) with an astonishing 0,07 USD. Altho the comparison between the 0,07USD is unfair due to a different time and day of the 30 USD gas price, the L1 30 USD is never coming close to L2 prices.

Let’s just say that Ethereum becomes só successful that the price triples (imaginable) while Bitcoin stays in the same place (not imaginable, but for argument’s sake). With the current way of calculating the gasprices on the L1 network, this can never happen if mass-adoption is to occur. No one would be willing to pay over 100 dollar, or maybe even over 200 dollar for a simple transaction, sometimes even exceeding the actual transacted amount. If you want to BE your own bank, if Ethereum wants to flip Bitcoin and make mass-adoption happen, it needs transaction costs to come down rapidly. The only way to realize this and create a consumer-friendly environment is via L2. While Visa realizes 2000 transactions per second with Ethereum 2.0 [Loopring’s L2 can do 100.000+ (!!!) per second](https://twitter.com/loopringorg/status/1346174642457878532), which would mean the small transactions via scaling can be realized, no problemo.

# Lastly

I get very excited talking about this stuff and writing it down makes me understand more. It makes me understand why Vitalik endorses L2 projects and considers ZkRollups as medium-to long term winners of the L2 arena. L2 projects such as Loopring are a gift from the sky that compliment Ethereum in an almost natural way. Coincidentally the L2 projects that have been worked on cannot come at a more convenient time. It may also help you understand why the Loopring team talks about “be your own bank” and why multinationals (behind the scenes) seem to work on integrating L2 projects: it also keeps THEM away from banks. It's one less party for them to interact with. Who trusts banks these days? It offers them the possibility to regain control, pay less and offer a more secure network.

I understand I have left a lot of info out of this piece, but it’s meant for newbies such as myself to understand why Loopring needs Ethereum and why Ethereum needs Loopring. I understand L2 uses the block-tech differently which is ***why*** it's so much cheaper, but that is for another time. The point is that there is more than just the pending partnerships. The future is bright.

**Frequently Asked Questions**

**Where's the best place to buy ETH?**

There are many centralized exchanges that support Ethereum. If you live in the US, the most popular exchanges are Coinbase, Gemeni and Kraken. Coinbase users can use Coinbase Pro for lower fees.

**When is Eth2 launching?**

Eth2 is a marketing term used to represent a number of updates to Ethereum. The Eth2 proof-of-stake chain first launched in December 2020. ""The Merge"", which is the event that will fully switch Ethereum's consensus to proof-of-stake, is estimated to be ready in early 2022, although there is no exact timeline. Other updates, such as data shards, will follow that update.

Visit [ethmerge.com](https://ethmerge.com/) to learn more about ""The Merge"".

**Do I need to do anything to update to Eth2? Will Eth2 create a new token?**

No, ETH holders *never* need to take any action to keep holding ETH. Ethereum users will be unaffected by the Eth2 upgrade. And the Eth2 updates will not create any new tokens.

**How can I stake my ETH?**

There are two ways that you can stake your ETH: by running your own validator, or providing your ETH to a staking pool.

* Running your own validator requires a modern computer and 32 ETH. Visit /r/ethstaker for more details
* Staking pools accept any amount of ETH. We recommend [Lido](https://lido.fi/) or [StakeWise](https://stakewise.io/)

**Why are Ethereum transaction fees so high?**

Like most blockchains, Ethereum fees are determined by supply-and-demand. The large demand to use Ethereum has pushed transaction fees quite high (however, fees were just a few cents only 2 years ago). Fees are especially high during market volatility, and during NFT drops.

**What is being done to lower Ethereum transaction fees?**

Ethereum fees are reduced by using layer-2 rollups. Rollups are scaling solutions that allow for significantly cheaper transactions, while still maintaining Ethereum's security.

Additionally, Eth2's data shards will make rollups even cheaper.

While rollups are cutting-edge technology being actively developed, a number are already live on Ethereum mainnet. Visit [l2beat.com](https://l2beat.com/) to learn more about rollups.

**What's the best wallet for Ethereum?**

The most popular tool for using decentralized applications is Metamask. However, for security reasons, we recommend using a hardware wallet such as a Trezor or Ledger.

Potential Merge Release Target: Mid June (This is not a finalized date),"There was a [CL call earlier](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bi2qZ2epaPM) where a potential target for the Merge going live was discussed: Mid June. I wanted to jump ahead of the inevitable misinformation claiming this is a hard-set date.

&#x200B;

**At this point**, there is hope that a V2 of [Kintsugi testnet](https://kintsugi.themerge.dev/) will be released in about 2-3 weeks. From there, client code completion is hoped in March with the a release shortly after of a 'finalized' testnet.  If that testnet goes well, a mainnet launch in June should be doable, getting in front of the currently scheduled difficulty bomb that would render Ethereum useless mid-end July if not delayed.

&#x200B;

# Things to understand:

1. This is an **ESTIMATION** based on the current state and understanding. There is nothing that would prevent further issues to arise that could delay this. It is very possible a severe vulnerability is discovered, a bug requiring re-architecture of certain mechanisms, or many other issues could arise.  If they do arise, there will be open discussions about the impact of those issues and what that means for a main net launch. This does not mean there is a 'Delay', just a better picture of where things are.  
 

2. No individual working on Ethereum should be held accountable for a Mid-June release at this point. That is way too far in advance for anyone to possibly plan for based on the complexity of the codebase and ecosystem. What those individuals should be held accountable for is proper communication of the immediate and near-future work they are doing. If they discover or run into issues, they must, and undoubtedly will, raise all the necessary alarms. \[I am not claiming there has ever been an issue with this\]   


3. Please, for the love of whatever, do not spread that Mid-June is some magic hard-set date of when the Merge will go live. It is, at best, an estimate given how everything stands. People have been giving polls of when they 'think' the Merge will go live but no one has a crystal ball that can foresee every potential issue.

&#x200B;

Everyone is excited about this change, rightly so, and people want it out yesterday, but everyone should want a **Correctly Built Merge** to go live, not the one that happens to exist Mid-June.",90.0,2022-01-27 18:26:14,0.94
Shills running huge anti nft campaign,"Lately it seems there is a constant barrage of anti nft post in non GME subreddits. I would name the subs but brigading and all. You’ve seen them. Seems like kenny and friends learned it’s easier to control the narrative on other sub reddits.

So I want to address a few arguments the shills like to use a lot.

“It relies on the greater fool theory to have any value”

No. Digital items in video games have had value long before NFTs came along.
Items in games such as Team Fortress 2 and counter strike sell for tens of thousands of dollars.

When NFTs will give you access to in-game items and cosmetics the value proposition becomes a lot more than “haha greater fool”

“NFTs are bad for the environment”

This is a technical problem that has already been solved by Proof of Stake blockchains, which, use about 1/100th the power of Proof of WORK chains. Ethereum is set to merge to Proof of stake this year.

“It’s a scam used to rip off artist and sell stolen artwork.”

Another problem MSM like to put under a microscope. They like to make a lot noise about people minting someone else’s art and selling it for a bunch of money. But in reality buyers know not to buy NFTs unless it from the original creator. Anyone can search an image in Google to see who created it originally. 

In reality NFTs have given artist another source of income, a new way to interact with their patrons and more freedom to work on projects they are passionate about.

“Money laundering, and tax evasion”

Yeah that probably does happen. But the rich do it all the time with regular art soooo…

"‘We are 50% of the way there,’ says Vitalik on Ethereum’s development. GLTA!!!","In a two-hour Bankless podcast episode, the Ethereum co-founder discussed his plans to make Eth2 succeed.

Vitalik Buterin has walked listeners through a five-part roadmap on the latest Bankless podcast where he outlined the necessary steps for Ethereum to survive and thrive.

In order to achieve ultimate scalability and decentralization, Butalik claimed that Ethereum needs to be more agile and more lightweight in terms of blockchain data so that more people can manage and use it.

At the beginning of December, Buterin also published an article titled “Endgame” where he makes the case that all blockchains will ultimately converge in the future while listing the tools that would allow for block verification to happen in a decentralized and censorship-resistant way.

The first step is called the merge, referring to the full transition away from proof-of-work to proof-of-stake, taking place in the first half of 2022. Part two, called the surge, plans to give Ethereum increased scalability, massive bandwidth and throughput, particularly on zk-Rollups. The merge and the surge are the most important upgrades, according to Buterin, to building out the Ethereum network.

When asked to evaluate Ethereum’s progress made so far in the past six years, Buterin asserted that “we are 50% of the way there” thanks to the launch of the Beacon Chain, the London hard fork and even the rise of nonfungible tokens. But there is still a long way to go.

Once the merge and surge go through, and there is full sharding implementation, then it will supposedly be 80% complete. The roadmap, which is estimated to take another six years to complete, will lead to 100% optimization, according to Buterin.

The next phases include the verge, enabling more users to run nodes and essentially “democratizing access to the broadest number of participants possible to anyone and everyone who wants to verify the validity of the chain,” said Buterin. Following the verge are the purge and splurge phases, referring to the elimination of historical data and the addition of miscellaneous upgrades, respectively. 

Buterin summarized his ideal scenario for an Ethereum 2.0 that doesn’t sacrifice decentralization for scalability:

“Leave the past in the past and create an Ethereum that actually becomes simpler and simpler over time.”

Buterin admitted that Etherum is “not yet the layer-one system that is ready for direct mass adoption” while reiterating the need for layer-two scaling solutions and reduced transaction fees. He does, however, note the “amazing” progress that Ethereum has seen in layer-two scaling over the past year and the community behind it that is “willing to continue fighting for it.”

In addition to scalability, another theme that Buterin emphasized is security and the safety measures around the upgrades. He compared blockchain building to the development of a city. Just as the police and the military work to defend their city or nation, so do blockchain users act as the security guards watching for attackers. And as cities expand or blocks get added to the chain, more security is needed.

Currently, Ethereum runs on about 2.6 megabytes per second of blockchain data, according to Buterin. He claimed that once Ethereum has the ability to add more bandwidth and increase the user base, “the more defenders will be able to run nodes and to verify that everything is going okay.”

A boilerplate message to your staking services provider who uses Prysm,"For those of you who are staking via a service provider that is using Prysm (many large ones, like Coinbase, Kraken, Binance, and Staked.us do), here is a boilerplate message that you can send to them to help convince them to switch to a minority client. This is very important for both your funds' safety and for the ultimate stability of Ethereum post-Merge.

If you are unsure whether your staking service provider uses Prysm or not, you can use the version [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/samoic/daily_general_discussion_january_23_2022/htx83wg/) instead.

-------------------------

Dear <staking services provider>,

I am currently staking <X> Ether with your service. I love that you have made this process of obtaining passive income from Ether easy for me. However, it has come to my attention that you are currently using the Ethereum consensus client Prysm for running your validators and consensus nodes. Prysm is currently a supermajority client, with roughly 2/3 of the total Beacon Chain validators running it. This is very problematic for several reasons, and as a customer of yours, I would like to ask you to please switch to a minority client such as Teku, Nimbus, or Lighthouse, or at the very least an even distribution of the available clients. Ideally, no single client would have more than 33% of the total stake. I am not staking further Ether with you until you resolve this issue.

To be clear, using a majority Ethereum consensus client like Prysm puts my funds, and the stability of the Beacon Chain, and of Ethereum as a whole, at risk. If problems were to emerge with that client's implementation, at best the inactivity leak from a majority of all validators experiencing the same downtime would lead to a loss of staking rewards for me and all of your staking clients. Worse, it could lead to mass slashing and heavy loss of our funds. And worst of all, it could lead to major consensus failures and chain splits on Ethereum, which would be bad if it were to happen now, and catastrophic to the entire crypto ecosystem (the source of all of your profits as a staking service provider and crypto exchange) if it were to happen after the Merge.

For more information, please see this page: https://upgrading-ethereum.info/altair/part2/incentives/diversity

So again, as your staking customer, I strongly urge you to switch from Prysm to a minority client for your staking services, and will not be staking further Ether with you until you do.

Thank you very much,

Ethereum 2.0 finality time?,"I'm trying to figure out the finality of Ethereum when it is fully upgraded in several years.  After the merge, splurge, verge, surge, all that jazz, when Ethereum's roadmap is fully complete, what will it's finality time be?

With a 6.4 minute epoc time, will we need to wait 2.5 epocs as I've seen before?  I'm wondering what Ethereum's final form will be and if we will still be waiting 15 minutes to consider a transaction final.

I'm extremely bullish on ETH, but if it's finality will never be under 15 minutes, there HAS to be other chains who will thrive with fast finality times.  In my opinion if this is the case, it confirms that the future is multi-chain.  Are there other solutions on Ethereum that I'm not aware of?

Five good reasons to be bullish even tho everything's crashing right now,"Hear ye, hear ye, my dear friends.

Today it hurts, I won't lie. Months and months of unrealized profits, poof, gone. We can spend all day moping around, but it won't get us anywhere. Nothing has changed our investment thesis: crypto will improve our world, so in the long run, we'll be rewarded.

I feel like chasing the gloomy sub mood, so here are five reasons to stay bullish for the long term.

**1-Several hundreds millions of people hold & use crypto worldwide**

It's hard to get an accurate estimate, but the best source I could find states that there is [at least 300 million people holding crypto in the world](https://triple-a.io/crypto-ownership/). We definitely got mainstream last year, and the sheer amount of users makes it unlikely everything will go to zero anytime soon.

**2-Energy consumption of crypto will go down a lot, very soon**

This week, US Congress is holding hearings about the energy consumption of cryptocurrencies. People are concerned about this, but here's the thing : the second biggest coin out there by market cap, ETH, will switch off proof-of-work forever [in six months](https://ethblogging.wordpress.com/2021/12/24/eth-merge-eth-2-0-upgrade-will-be-renamed-to-bellatrix-hard-fork-eth-to-the-stars-and-beyond/). This will cut down it's energy consumption by about 99% - and the same goes for every ERC-20 tokens and every ERC-721 NFTs out there.

**3-Usecases are becoming more and more apparent**

Unbanked people in Argentina are using the Binance Smart Chain to accept payments. Major credit cards companies such as Visa and MasterCard are launching crypto products. Web3 social media is rising fast - same for P2E blockchain-based games. ENS domains are becoming a thing. The list goes on and on.

**2-Institutions are getting onboard**

While it may take a while, pension funds, hedge funds and state-sponsored sovereign funds are getting interested in crypto. [About 7 out of 10 institutional investors](https://www.forbes.com/sites/lawrencewintermeyer/2021/08/12/institutional-money-is-pouring-into-the-crypto-market-and-its-only-going-to-grow/?sh=4b3f69114598) recently surveyed by Forbes planned to buy and hold crypto. Medium-term, this will make our assets less volatile, with blue-chips such as ETH and BTC beeing seen as ""internet bonds"".

**1-The most brillant minds are getting into crypto**

The crypto job market is in a frenzy. Developers are leaving web giants to go work for CEXs, L2 solutions, fintechs, etc. An Ethereum developer can get $300k/year nowadays. Cryptography research is going very well, and concepts such as zero-knowledge proof are already being used in protocols. For those ""in it for the tech"", the future looks bright.

We will make it, my friends!",496.0,2022-01-21 20:51:58,0.85
A collection of various things the average /r/ethereum browser should know about Ethereum,"So I know it's gonna be very controversial to post a lot of pro-Ethereum stuff in /r/ethereum given all the maxis and ETH killer moonboys who love to spread FUD in every thread. And it's very easy to attack Ethereum when you don't understand what it's trying to be and what it's trying to achieve. So I figured I'd post all the general statements that I and many other have been making over and over for a while now. I'm happy to elaborate on any of them, but please keep the discussion in good faith. I'm also willing to add more points if I forgot some. Some of these are my own opinion, some definitely require more context to understand properly (again, happy to elaborate) but the goal is to quickly summarize all the different stuff that gets brought up over and over.

Anyway yeah, if you're invested in Ethereum, or at the very least interested in it enough to be browsing this sub (why else would you be here lol) then you should be aware of the following:

1. Ethereum is the network, Ether is the currency. And there is no ""I"" anywhere in the name.

2. [Fees are high](https://cryptofees.info/) because that's how much the market values Ethereum's limited blockspace. It's purely supply and demand.
    * Fees scale with [how much computation is being executed](https://docs.ethhub.io/using-ethereum/transactions/), not how much money is being handled. It costs $5 on average to send any amount of Ether, whether it's $1's worth or $1 million's. It costs much more to do swaps and mint NFTs and such because those operations require more computation.
    * There is no way for anyone to artificially keep fees high unless they're willing to [literally burn millions of dollars per day for no reason](https://watchtheburn.com/).

3. Ethereum's blockspace is limited because letting people run nodes themselves on average consumer hardware is important for decentralization.
    * Decentralization is a spectrum and has many meanings from protocol specification, protocol implementation, node distribution, coin distribution, censorship resistance, permissionlessness, etc.
    * Pointing at one aspect to scream ""centralized"" isn't clever nor helpful. Chances are the aspect you point out is known and is an active area of research with a concrete plan on [the roadmap](https://i.imgur.com/vXMaIyZ.png) to address it and increase decentralization some more.
    * No blockchain is ever fully decentralized, especially not from the start – and Ethereum's end goal is to be able to run without a hiccup for *decades* if not *centuries*. At 6.5 years old, it's still very young.
    * If you care about decentralization, invest in and contribute to projects like Ethereum who view it as a goal, not a crutch that ""nobody cares about it that much anyway, let's just [increase the gas limit](https://github.com/binance-chain/bsc/issues/553) to have low fees asap""

4. There is a [vast difference](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/nodes-and-clients/#node-types) between an ""archive node"" (several TBs) and a ""full node"" (hundreds of GBs)
    * Running an archive node is not necessary to sync from genesis and verify blocks and transactions.
    * A full node has all the information enough to generate an archive node.
    * There are plans on [the roadmap](https://i.imgur.com/vXMaIyZ.png) to reduce the storage/bandwidth/RAM requirements of nodes even more, to a point where a smartphone will be able to independently verify and propagate new blocks. 

5. There is no ""when eth2 rolls out"" or ""when devs release eth2"" or god forbid ""when ethereum is upgraded to 2.0"". What there is instead is a roadmap consisting of a series of upgrades aiming to help rollups – *not the base layer* – scale to hundreds of thousands of TPS.
    * Depending on context, Eth1 is usually synonymous with ""execution layer"" and Eth2 usually means ""consensus layers"" ([helpful illustration](https://i.imgur.com/AHHcUgm.png)) otherwise ""eth2"" is an umbrella term for the set of upgrades over a long period of time, but the fact remains that there is no specific instant in time where ""eth1 turns into eth2"".
    * Similarly, there is no ""eth2"" coin. ETH is ETH, you don't have to do anything, the coins you hold today will be the same after the switch to proof of stake.

6. Unlocking staked Ether [will not cause a mass sell-off event](https://twitter.com/domothy/status/1467387422765953029). There is a limited withdrawing queue, it's not gonna happen all at once. And there are many more reasons for more people to start staking Ether than there are for the current stakers to exit en masse.
    * Also, unlocking staked Ether will not be possible directly after the merge. Withdrawals will be enable in the first fork that follows the merge ~6 months later.

7. There are plenty of options to avoid high gas fees, it's perfectly fine to use a sidechain to do your DeFi stuff for now. I use sidechains myself too. Just don't pretend these sidechains will replace Ethereum in any significant way as that's not even what they're trying to do.

8. Switching to Proof of Stake [will not lower Layer 1 gas fees significantly](https://willthemergelowergasprices.org/). Anyone saying otherwise is either misinformed or trying to mislead you into false expectations to bank on the inevitable mass disappointment following the merge.
    * It's still a monumental upgrade that will render possible much-needed upgrades like light clients, statelessness, and sharding, etc. that would otherwise be impossible or impractical to implement on the current proof of work chain.
    * It's basically a way to ""start from scratch"" while keeping the same coin, same users, same dapps, same network effects.
    * PoS has been on the roadmap [since day 1](https://blog.ethereum.org/2015/03/03/ethereum-launch-process/). Yes, estimates of PoS dates have been wrong before. However right now it's all hands on deck on the merge, the spec is done, the beacon chain is running, there is a [merge testnet running](https://blog.ethereum.org/2021/12/20/kintsugi-merge-testnet/), it's happening.

9. Sharding will not lower Layer 1 gas fees significantly either. Sharding is all about *data*, execution on Layer 1 will still be limited and expensive. What data sharding will do is help rollups (Layer 2) scale by several orders of magnitude.

10. [Rollups](https://mirror.xyz/ethmaxitard.eth/iyCAlOexgQKOvoSAAk4utYGEdnESOKb5HstM2_LaqL4) are [already live today](https://l2beat.com/) and they will only [get cheaper](https://l2fees.info/) as more people use them.

11. [Data sharding + rollups is the only sustainable way](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/pk57n7/why_rollups_data_shards_are_the_only_sustainable/) to scale a blockchain globally without compromising decentralization.
    * ""Sustainable"" as in the overall security model doesn't rely on hoping that the coin's price will pump forever to outpace the dilution from the blockchain issuing way more new coins than they collect in fees. Something that all major blockchains (including Ethereum most days, and even Bitcoin) are currently doing.
    * ""Without compromising decentralization"" as in more decentralization = more data for rollups = more scaling (lower individual fees on L2). Decentralization becomes an integral part of the scaling equation rather than a crutch.
    * [The rollup-centric roadmap](https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/a-rollup-centric-ethereum-roadmap/4698) is all about admitting that no single blockchain can do it all by itself and can't compete with what rollups can do. In other words, ""Ethereum maximalism"" amounts to helping independent teams develop rollups, innovate and compete with each other on top of Ethereum's secure, decentralized, and open platform.
    * The true competition of sidechains is rollups, not Ethereum itself. 
    * All the criticisms of a multi-rollup world apply to the current multi-chain world model as well. Except they apply way more to the multi-chain world and can be overcome way more easily in a multi-rollup world.
    * A rollup can settle on any L1, sure, but it's gonna gravitate towards the most secure, most decentralized and most credibly neutral settlement layer with the best data availability. Right now only Bitcoin and Ethereum fit those criteria (other L1s optimize for fast execution, not secure data availability) and Bitcoin would need a hard fork to implement rollup-friendly functions, so that only leaves Ethereum as the poised [""AWS for blockchain""](https://twitter.com/domothy/status/1465905887541972996).

12. Ether isn't meant to be a day-to-day currency that will replace fiat. The use-case of Ether isn't to pay for bread and milk, it's to pay for gas fees and secure the network. All the other use-cases derive from Ether's scarcity, but they're not strictly necessary.
    * Having Ether be an appreciating asset is good for the overall long-term health of the network by providing it with more [economic security, its holders more economic bandwidth](https://i.imgur.com/AErfdod.png), and its users more reasons to hold/stake. The incoming deflation is good.
    * However, the supply is not gonna be deflationary forever. The market dictates how much the blockspace is worth (so how much gets burned) and it also dictates how much the staking APR should be (so how much gets printed) so these two opposing forces will meet in the middle at some point. It's all about [them feedback loops](https://i.imgur.com/3bPV35a.png).

13. The security model trumps the economic model. The core idea behind the economic model is: ""[Minimum viable issuance to secure the network](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/izhkvk/minimum_viable_issuance_why_ethereums_lack_of_a/)"". It was designed from the start to be [disinflationary](https://blog.ethereum.org/2014/04/10/the-issuance-model-in-ethereum/) (as in, inflation % terms goes down over time) with even the idea of fee burning being mentioned in [early](https://blog.ethereum.org/2016/07/27/inflation-transaction-fees-cryptocurrency-monetary-policy/) publications and [FAQ](https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/Proof-of-Stake-FAQ/ba766606790d80422b23650d3326e2d963bdfa87)

14. It's okay to change or tweak things when new research indicates there's a problem with long-term sustainability or security of the current model. These changes don't happen ""on a whim of a few people"", there's a lot of consideration that go into them.
    * And remember, changes happen in a highly adversarial context. If there's *any* possibility of an upgrade causing security problems or being exploited in any way for profit, then it *will* happen. Changes don't just happen for fun ""just because"", they happen when their benefits outweigh the inherent risks of potentially adding more complexity.

15. The Ethereum Foundation is more of a [coordinator than a dictator](https://ethereum.foundation/philosophy/). It's much more of a community-focused bottom-up approach than the top-down structure people think.
    * Everything happens extremely transparently on open forums that no one reads and [public livestream calls](https://www.youtube.com/c/EthereumFoundation/videos) that no one listens to. But everyone who wants to participate is welcome, it's all out in the open.
    * The Ethereum Foundation doesn't code any of the actual software, client teams do. There are 5 major execution clients and 4 major consensus clients, developed by independent teams, to implement the protocol specification. This multi-client approach may be responsible for development delays, but it comes with [security benefits](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/mreacw/psa_the_importance_of_multiclient_and_why_the/)
    * [Anyone can propose an Ethereum Improvement Proposal](https://ethereum.org/en/eips/). You just have to convince others it's a good idea to implement it (most EIPs don't get implemented and fall into obscurity) and the clients could just refuse to code it in if it's a very bad idea. The more time passes, the harder it becomes to push changes to the Ethereum protocol and everything converges to the status quo. (This doesn't close the door to further innovation however, as it's still an open platform on which anyone can build)
    * Vitalik regularly gets his proposals blocked by client teams, other researchers, or the community in general. At most, he's a knowledgeable influence because he knows the tech and cryptography in depth and has been there from the beginning. It's silly to worship him, and it's silly to treat him as Ethereum's Zucc-like CEO. He's ""just some guy"".

16. The ""[DAO hard fork](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-779)"" wasn't a roll-back. Not a single transaction was reverted, no one lost any funds other than the exploiter who could have otherwise gotten away with [15% of the total supply at the time](https://www.coindesk.com/learn/2016/06/25/understanding-the-dao-attack/). It wasn't a bailout of Vitalik and his pals, it was a bailout of a huge chunk of the community from an event that could have killed the whole thing in its infancy. 
    * In the end it's all social consensus, and the consensus from miners, users, developers was strong. Even ""code is law"" is social consensus that [can get reverted in case of major bugs](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Value_overflow_incident). It's all about what the community deems [legitimate](https://vitalik.ca/general/2021/03/23/legitimacy.html).
    * *edit: see comments for more nuance on this point*

17. As far as the [initial distribution](https://i.imgur.com/k3GB8Lh.png) goes, Ethereum's ICO is among [the best of those who had an ICO](https://i.imgur.com/fmW3ytf.png), and as far as the current distribution goes (after 6 years of proof of work and market movements), it's [on par with Bitcoin's](https://medium.com/@adamscochran/the-10k-audit-42c100dd32bb). 60m of the 72m ""pre-mined"" coins went to a permissionless no-KYC sale, and [all the genesis transactions are included in Block #0](https://etherscan.io/txs?block=0) so you can check yourself that there's no hidden coins. Just like Bitcoin, early investors took on big risks and got big rewards. No surprises here. Any concerns of the ICO being a scam or rugpull should have vanished some time in 2015, yet here we are still talking about it for some reason.
    * And if coin distribution is a concern to you because proof of stake, then you should be glad the DAO hack didn't end up with a single person owning 15% of the supply...
    * *edit: see comments for more nuance on this point too lol*

18. There is no ""technical debt"" preventing Ethereum from scaling.

19. EIP-1559 was [not meant to lower gas fees](https://web.archive.org/web/20210205013340/https://willeip1559lowergasprices.org/) and no credible person ever promised it was a scaling solution.
    * It has [many benefits](https://domothy.com/eip1559/) beyond coin burning. The deflation is a nice side effect, and it's certainly not a gimmick meant to pump the price.

20. Proof of Work is really just Proof of Stake with extra steps.
    * In both systems, the goal is reach consensus in a sybil-resistant way. Spending time and energy by computing hashes over and over is just the easiest way to reach that goal. But if we can achieve that goal (randomness + verifiable delay functions) without using the energy of a continent, maybe we should look into it.
    * In both systems, whoever has capital gets to earn more capital by producing more blocks. (Except in Proof of Stake, everyone earns at the same rate, proportional to how much they stake)
    * In both systems, the capital that someone has at stake (mining rigs vs coins directly) is a good indicative that they will play by the rules.
    * By design, [Ethereum doesn't have on-chain governance](https://docs.ethhub.io/ethereum-basics/governance/#on-chain-governance). This means that the people with the most coins can't change the rules under PoS any more than the people with the most hash rate can change the rules under PoW.
    * Just like there are mining pools, there are staking pools. As usual, some options are [more decentralized and community-focused](https://rocketpool.net/) than others.",1067.0,2022-01-20 16:21:08,0.99
A beginners Guide to Cryptocurrency,"**What is a blockchain?**

It is an “immutable ledger.” Think about it like a book that lives in the sky. Every time something changes, its written down with magic ink, that when dries, never changes. And there are thousands of copies of these books, all getting updated at the same time. If one is ever messed with, the other books would wipe out the problem and replace it with the correct entry.

(Tedtalk – Blockchain Massively simplified)

[https://www.mbcg.io/vision?pgid=kn921drf-2058f817-4ebc-4c29-8430-a667933ff044](https://www.mbcg.io/vision?pgid=kn921drf-2058f817-4ebc-4c29-8430-a667933ff044)

**What is proof of Work?**

First generation crypto currency worked of the concept of Poof of work. There, it is a race to solve a complicated math puzzle, and perform the block write operation. And as a reward get coin. “Mining.” Mining is slow. Bitcoin can only do 7 transactions a minute.

Of the thousands and thousands of machines out there racing to win the next block, only 1 at a time wins. That means the others have literally wasted their energy via compute CPU and GPU cycles. Bitcoin used more energy than Argentina last year.  
But its not all bad. POW is still the oldest and most battle tested consensus algorithm, and many ague more secure because of it. 

[https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/proof-work.asp](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/proof-work.asp)

[https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-56012952](https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-56012952)

**What is proof of Stake?**

Proof of Stake works on different types of newly developed “Consensus” algorithms. Ouroboros protocol, created by IHOK and Cardano, along with a team of PHDs and mathematicians, is the first of its kind. They created a secure “lottery” consensus mechanism to “elect” the next “slot leader” to write the block. Here each Stake pool can get a chance to be elected by winning the lottery. Each Ada coin represents 1 lottery ticket. When you delegate to the pool, you give that pool your ticket, not your coin. If the pool wins, you get the reward along with everyone in the pool, and the operator. Because there is no more complicated math puzzle, and no more computers racing to solve the puzzle, its much much faster, and much much cheaper. Cardano nodes can be run on Raspberry Pi.. A lot of nodes out there run on Solar energy. It’s so good, Ethereum, who is proof of work currently, is moving to this model as part of their ETH 2.0 migration. Hopefully this summer with the ""merge."" In efforts to reduce gas fees and energy concerns. Pokodot created its own Consensus algorithm. Called Grandpa. Tezos has its Emmy+, and the list goes on. 

Each other their own way of doing things. But “gen 3” is not Proof of work.

What you should remember is that for both POW, POS, and others, they are all a means of incentivizing the actual people that run the computers hosting the blockchain code. Without them, there is no “decentralized network of immutable ledgers.” Which is because that’s just fancy talk for machines running our code to support the blockchain.

**What is Market Cap and coin supply and why should we care?**

Market Capitalization is equal to Price of Coin times Supply of Coin. That is, it. But very important.

BITCOIN has a fixed supply. It is not all mined yet. Not until 2140. But it does have a finite amount, 21 Million.

Here is why you can see a 65K or even 100K bitcoin, but you’ll probably never see a 100 dollar DOGE, or even a 30 Dollar Ada (not soon anyway)

Currently there are  18,929,200 BTC out there at a cost of 43,087.16.

That means, the market cap is 43,087.16 x 18,929,200  = 815,605,469,072 (815B)

Cardano, has a fixed coin supply as well. But it is 45 Billion. There are currently 33,526,814,681. So you see the max is 2500x more. Likewise, with 130B DOGE vs 18M BTC - it’s \~6700X more. DogeCoin also makes 10,000 new coins a minute.

At a price is 1.26 that means the market cap for Cardano is 1.26 X 33,526,814,681 = 42,243,786,498.06 (42B)

You’ll need 136B market cap to reach a 1-dollar DOGE in the next year.

132,670,764,300 + ((10,000\*60\*24\*351) = 137,725,164,300 (Supply of DOGE in 1 year from now)  
137,725,164,300 \* 1 = 137,725,164,300

You'll need an almost 1 Trillion Market Cap for Cardano to hit 3032,127,627,594 \* 30 = 963,828,827,820

To give you some reference. Here is the Market cap of some big names.

Visa – 499B

Adobe – 250B

Amazon – 1.7T

It’s very confusing because every coin has their own supply. Their own way of creating coins and at what cadence. Some even “burn” coins. So, know what yours does and how it works.

**How can I “get in early?”**

First. We are all early. You might not have gotten in on the first floor, but we’re only halfway up the stairs to the second flight.

Global wealth is estimated at 1 quadrillion. All the Market Cap in crypto is at 2.05 Trillion. That’s only 0.21% of the world’s wealth.

When looking for “what could be the next big thing” find something with a low market cap, regardless of coin price, that has a strong chance of doing well because of team and tech, the two Ts.

Also ask yourself.

What are these coins use cases?

Who is their target audience for adoption?

Who is funding them?

Who is their team building it? What is their history?

Do they have a good plan?

[https://river.com/learn/how-much-worlds-money-in-bitcoin/#:\~:text=Global%20wealth%20is%20estimated%20at,represents%200.09%25%20of%20global%20wealth](https://river.com/learn/how-much-worlds-money-in-bitcoin/#:~:text=Global%20wealth%20is%20estimated%20at,represents%200.09%25%20of%20global%20wealth).

**What are your goals?**

Crypto is really split into 4 worlds.

Day traders, H.O.D.L.’ers, Whales, and weak hands.

Day traders realize that this market is very volatile, now, and historically. Good ones, can capitalize on quick gains by buying low and selling high, waiting for a dip, then buying back in, and selling high again, cyclically.

Then there are those that “Hold On for Dear Life.” These people tend to find something they really are passionate about, and never sell. They keep buying. If they see their coin dips, below at what they bought it at, and have some extra funds, they buy more, to ""Average Down."" Or Dollar cost average (DCA) by buying a set amount on a regular cadence. They only “take profit” buy selling a small portion when price is really high.

Whales, are investors that come in with millions and billions of dollars. They often “test” the market buy either buying or dumping millions and billions in hopes to manipulate the market to their advantage. If you’re reading this, you’re probably not in this category, but you should know they exist and effect this marketplace.

Then there are “weak hands.” Do not pick this one. These people buy high and sell low. They only invest based on emotion, and nothing else. When things start going bad, they panic, and sell at a loss. Its much better to let your coin go to .000000001 cents, and just hold on to it in the hopes of a rally years later, then it is to ever sell at a loss. Never do this. Never.

Each has its own risks and rewards.

Day trading can rack up dollars quick, but you can lose them just as quick. And there are tax implicates with trades. Some unknown, and constantly changing.

HODL, might take years, but if you do, the chance of your Return on Invest improves significantly in crypto.

Pick what works best for you but have a plan.

**What are things to look out for?**

**Do your own research**. There are now more then 4K types of crypto currencies. You can create your own in about 30 minutes with the right free tools.

The mortality rate of new coins is super high this year. Lots of people trying to do Pump and Dumps.

There is nothing in life that goes up for no reason, if it does, it’s a Ponzi scheme.

**What is the difference between storing on an exchange or in a wallet?**

A lot.

First, you must remember what the dream of crypto is really offering.

Its offering a way for us to break away from banks. Forever.

Centralized banks that can print money, is a problem. Blockchain solves this.

But not if the new bank ends up being Binace or Coinbase. In fact, keeping your coin in exchanges puts us all at risk of market manipulation by them.

When a certain 1 person or group owns too many nodes, they can make choices that would benefit them. The attack vector is called a 51% attack or sybil attack.

Today however, you need exchanges to on ramp and off ramp FIAT. FIAT money is government-issued currency that is not backed by a physical commodity, such as gold or silver.

But it will not be like that forever. Chains like ADA and DOT will be interoperable with legacy banks and will eventually cut out exchanges.

Personally, I despise BNB coin and binace. They already take high fees, and now they want the control and the rewards too. Coinbase isn’t much better. Again though, a necessary evil, for now.

But more important than the “dream” is that they can be hacked.

They are a website. Not a blockchain. They hold the keys to your wallet, and let you use them with a weak password and no mfa if you like. Its literally like storing your money in a bank. So know your bank. Good thing, like a bank, SOME, are federally insured up to a certain amount. But some are not, and people have lost millions and billions in the past this way.

Lastly, there is the notification of “passive income” and “interest.”

With POS systems, delegators are incentivized to “stake” their coin by earning interest.

With POW systems, like bitcoin, you’d have to stand up your own machine, configure it, and let it use your energy in your house. With withs like Cardano Ada, and ETH 2.0, you can now pull your coin off the exchange, put it in a wallet, delegate to a pool, and earn interest. All while maintaining full control of your coins.

**What are Smart Contracts? (This one will blow your mind if you are a developer)**

First let us start with what most people say.

“Smart contracts are self-executing contracts with the terms of the agreement between buyer and seller being directly written into lines of code.”

Which is true for sure. It helps build trust and removes the cumbersome third party “trusted agent” like a bank.

But what smart contracts really are is “ANY Code” that can be written to a blockchain and NEVER be changed, forever.

ANY CODE. You can write your own coins and put them into the block. It happens a lot.

Games, sure, put in the chain. Check out CryptoKitties.

In the future ALL business will be blockchain businesses. Every transaction, every process in the building and distribution, will be written to a magic book that can’t be messed with.. Ever..

**What are NFTs?**

NonFungible Tokens is metadata attached to an asset. 

The metadata is things like who created it, and when. Along with the most important piece the link to the asset. 

The asset is what most people think of when they talk about NFTs.   
Its a digital file. Like a jpg or a mov file.   
But its not stored in the blockchain like most assume.   
Instead they are stored, most often, in IPFS storage.   
IPFS is very cool, but its not blockchain, and thus not ""immutable."" 

So what’s the big deal? I can upload a gif to the internet today.

The big deal is twofold.

First, you are not uploading anything to the “internet.” That whole thing we call the internet is flawed. Tracked, centralized, monitored, and gated.

What you are doing is creating an EARLY entry, in a book that will never change for the rest of time.

Let us sit and think about that for a second.

De Beers is going to have to get new slogan. “A ~~diamond~~ NFT is forever”

Right now, it is some awful GIF of a dogecoin. But it is not what it is. It is what it represents.

It is the next chapter in Art history. What is created will last longer than the Mona Lisa. Someday you will have blockchain archaeologist that comb though chains.

Plus, taking away the cool factor, they create a place that you can now prove you did it first.

Artist could upload lyrics as an NFT, and later sell them, without the fear their art might be stolen before a contract is in place. People could attach their house deed to a chain, and ever again dispute who owns the land after a conflict.

Besides gaming, NFTs are frequently used to sell a wide range of virtual collectibles, including NBA virtual trading cards, music, digital images, video clips and even virtual real estate in [Decentraland](https://decentraland.org/), a virtual world.  


That of course is the rosier outlook on NFTs.   


Unfortunately, in practice there are many gaps today.   


The first I already mentioned. The asset is not stored in the blockchain.   
What that means is that the IPFS provider could ""unpin"" your asset, and if its not saved anywhere else, you'll end up with an NFT that has metadata that points to a url that has nothing there.   


The second problem, is that there are thousands of blockchains. People can take your asset, because its publicly pined, and then go create an NFT on another blockchain, and then claim theirs is in fact the original. You'd have to check every chain that supports NFTs to ensure it was in fact the first first.   


Or people have taken hard artwork, like paintings, and then minted and sold them as NFTs.

Merge Status Update and Checklist,"People are asking ""when merge"" daily. These links give the best answer as no one knows for sure. Progress is being made although June seems unlikely. During the final testnets I'd suggest everyone join to put the network under load so that the merge is properly tested. We will post when that happens closer to the date of the merge with instructions how to join.

Everything About Ethereum's Triple Halving in Q2,"# What's a halving? 

New Bitcoin are issued each time a block is mined. In 2009 the reward was 50 BTC for mining a block. Every 210,000 blocks the reward is *halved*. It takes about 10 minutes to mine a block so a **halving** event occurs every 4 years. 

The last halving was May 11, 2020 when the issuance dropped from 12.5 BTC per block to 6.25 BTC per block, or 1800 new BTC per day to 900 new BTC per day. 

In 2032 there will be 0.78 new BTC per block, just 12.5% as much as today. 

# Ethereum Triple Halving 

The miners producing blocks on Ethereum are receiving approximately 14,000 new ETH per day. The chain's inflation rate is somewhere around 4.5% annually and has no fixed supply unlike Bitcoin. 

This year [around Q2](https://ethereum.org/en/eth2/merge/) the POW chain is being shut off forever and being replaced with a more efficient POS chain. Instead of miners, validators (stakers) will receive ~1,400 new ETH per day. The chain's inflation rate will drop to 0.5% annually, just 10% as much as today! 

# That's cool, what about gas fees? 

Two things. 

One is an upgrade from last August, EIP1559. All base fees are burned. Since then about 3% of the annual supply of ETH has been burned. With EIP1559 and the POS merge the total issuance will be around -2.5% per year. **Ethereum will become deflationary**. 

And two... Contrary to popular belief POS will not reduce gas fees. It's only meant to reduce the amount of new ETH being created. Gas fees will likely rise to uncomfortable levels and maintain until sharding potentially ~6 years out. 

# Welcome to Rollup-Centric Ethereum 

Rollups reduce gas fees by 100-1000x essentially by *rolling* 100-1000 transactions into one single transaction. Some with the ability to use a mix of on and off-chain data computation.  

**The more congested the network is the cheaper it becomes** since there are more people to split the one gas fee with, opposite of what we have today. 

It would take a whole seperate post to get into how different rollups function but it's a massive bandwidth upgrade..

# Why? 

Ethereum's monetary policy has always been ""minimum issuance to secure the network"". 

POW attacks are ineffective for POS chains. 

First you'd have to control 51% of the staked ETH. To do so you'd need to buy ~5-16 million ETH drastically increasing the price. Then you can only spin up so many validators per day. Then you'd probably cause ETH's value to drop from any manipulation. Other validators can vote to have your stake slashed from bad behaviour drastically increasing the financial burden to attempt a second attack. 

There's very little incentive to destroy the value of a currency you have a majority stake in. There are stronger incentives to keep the network secure and healthy. 

# What else should I know? 

After the merge staked ETH issuance is locked until another upgrade next year. That means no *new* ETH will be sold on any market for ~6 months, only ETH that came from POW. 

All the numbers I listed for ETH are variable. They depend on how much ETH is staked and how much gas is used. Right now 9M ETH are staked so the POS inflation rate is 1,400 ETH per day, with 20M ETH staked the inflation rate would be 2,000 ETH per day. Since EIP1559 the burn has averaged 3% but only counting today it's 5%. www.Ultrasound.money has a pretty good graph and calculator to simulate the different variables. 

Don't feel sitgma moving your assets to L2. It's cheap to bridge from L2 to L2 and in the near future bridges will become integrated into wallets and all exchanges. Layer 2's are able to provide gas-free environments, social recovery wallets (forgot your password?), and allows developers to secure their tokens in novel semi-centralized ways - like ingame economies, everything too data intensive to be run off an L1. www.Layerswap.io Let's you transfer from your centralized exchange account to another CEX account which is typically free to do, and that amount gets deposited into your L2 wallet. You can also buy into L2 directly using debit/credit with services like www.ramp.network which keep increasing support for L2's. 

ZkEvm is around the corner and soon L2's will be able to plug into dApps like Uniswap or Aave and Opensea. Currently they're limited to specific use cases. 

# What after? 

The price of Ethereum will likely lose a lot of its volitility and become more stable after three halvings, akin to BTC in 2032. 

Things like NFTs won't be ""bad for the environment"" under POS and there may even be fewer GPU shortages in the future. Things like ERC1155 will make more sense with L2. 

The incentives change in POS. With POW you would typically sell your rewards to cover the ever increasing electricity and hardware costs. With POS the incentive is to restake for compounding interest. This means there will be much fewer ETH for sale in the future, in a time when demand (mostly securing apps/rollups) has never been so high. 

The tips that go to miners now will go to stakers. Ethereum will offer about 10-20% APR for staking after The Merge.. at a time when banks offer 0.05%. This will decrease as more validators join, or if *everyone* leaves L1 for L2 and gas usage decreases.

**Frequently Asked Questions**

**Where's the best place to buy ETH?**

There are many centralized exchanges that support Ethereum. If you live in the US, the most popular exchanges are Coinbase, Gemeni and Kraken. Coinbase users can use Coinbase Pro for lower fees.

**When is Eth2 launching?**

Eth2 is a marketing term used to represent a number of updates to Ethereum. The Eth2 proof-of-stake chain first launched in December 2020. ""The Merge"", which is the event that will fully switch Ethereum's consensus to proof-of-stake, is estimated to be ready in early 2022, although there is no exact timeline. Other updates, such as data shards, will follow that update.

Visit [ethmerge.com](https://ethmerge.com/) to learn more about ""The Merge"".

**Do I need to do anything to update to Eth2? Will Eth2 create a new token?**

No, ETH holders *never* need to take any action to keep holding ETH. Ethereum users will be unaffected by the Eth2 upgrade. And the Eth2 updates will not create any new tokens.

**How can I stake my ETH?**

There are two ways that you can stake your ETH: by running your own validator, or providing your ETH to a staking pool.

* Running your own validator requires a modern computer and 32 ETH. Visit /r/ethstaker for more details
* Staking pools accept any amount of ETH. We recommend [Lido](https://lido.fi/) or [StakeWise](https://stakewise.io/)

**Why are Ethereum transaction fees so high?**

Like most blockchains, Ethereum fees are determined by supply-and-demand. The large demand to use Ethereum has pushed transaction fees quite high (however, fees were just a few cents only 2 years ago). Fees are especially high during market volatility, and during NFT drops.

**What is being done to lower Ethereum transaction fees?**

Ethereum fees are reduced by using layer-2 rollups. Rollups are scaling solutions that allow for significantly cheaper transactions, while still maintaining Ethereum's security.

Additionally, Eth2's data shards will make rollups even cheaper.

While rollups are cutting-edge technology being actively developed, a number are already live on Ethereum mainnet. Visit [l2beat.com](https://l2beat.com/) to learn more about rollups.

**What's the best wallet for Ethereum?**

The most popular tool for using decentralized applications is Metamask. However, for security reasons, we recommend using a hardware wallet such as a Trezor or Ledger.

The Merge - June 2022,"I was browsing Ethereum's source code in [github](https://github.com/ethereum) and came across the term [TERMINAL\_TOTAL\_DIFFICULTY](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/6816df86d006c1db4df91f88c574c27aa4d937c5/EIPS/eip-3675.md#definitions). My brain started thinking about the [difficulty bomb delay](https://blog.ethereum.org/2021/11/10/arrow-glacier-announcement/) to June 2022.  Maybe it was already obvious to everyone but this looks like the date of the merge to me.

"Summary of Hoskinson DApps and Development talk, 2022-01-02","Full video is here: [Whiteboard: DApps and Development - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yt4Sg6rs80Q)

New year:  Fun, lots will happen, lots to build and do.  IOG will be building a new studio, and more education will be happening.  This talk is a whiteboard session.  \[This summary does not include Hoskinson’s drawings, but rather just the gist of his talk.]

To learn about the Cardano development experience, start with docs.cardano.org.  For a deeper intro comparing the Ethereum programming model with the Cardano (extended) unspent transaction output (eUTxO) model, see: [\[2003.14271\] UTxO- vs account-based smart contract blockchain programming paradigms (arxiv.org)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.14271).  EUTxO lends itself to more of a functional, as opposed to imperative, programming style.

At this point, Hoskinson moved into the meat of his talk, beginning with a discussion of expressiveness.  At one end, the minimal end, of the expressiveness scale is Bitcoin Script (based on UTxO).  At the other end are full run-time environments like the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) that can run entire applications, like Minecraft.  In the middle, but more towards the JVM end, is the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), which possesses great expressiveness and power but needs (for security and other reasons) to be restricted in various ways.

But is a model as expressive as Ethereum's needed for things like NTFs, oracles, smart contracts, and DeFi?  Or will something less expressive (in which it is easier to scale, verify, predict costs, and secure), work as well?

In contrast to the Ethereum model, the Cardano eUTxO model starts with something leaner, more towards the Bitcoin Script end of the expressiveness scale.  At that end of the scale, it is easier to be sure things like smart contracts do what they purport to do without unexpected side effects.  Cardano starts with this more restrictive model and dials it forward as needed via mechanisms like Cardano Improvement Proposals (CIPs), rather than the reverse, that is, to start out very expressive and powerful, but then dial back and limit that power as problems turn up.  The same is also true about centralization (it is better to start out *de*centralized then move towards more centralization, e.g., on sidechains, than to try to retrofit a centralized system for decentralization).

Cardano is very concerned with things like predictability, e.g., with how much a transaction will cost (*deterministic cost,* virtually unattainable in account-based models).  Speed is another issue, and it is being gradually ramped up in a number of ways, for example, through block-size increases and through both network and core-node optimization.  All this work happens within the limits of a propagation goal (or limit), namely that new blocks added to the chain must reach 95% of nodes within five seconds.

Because blocks are not created continuously, but at specific intervals, like a heartbeat, another way to optimize is to do work between these heartbeats (“pipelining”).  One can, for example, create multiple blocks in parallel, between the heartbeats, then merge them in (part of the Ouroboros consensus protocol design).  All chains are thinking about these same kinds of optimizations, and they operate under the same basic constraints.  These constraints are network propagation speed and optimism (balancing trust and increased size and velocity against the need to stop and validate the extra blocks).  On the Cardano blockchain, this involves *input endorsers,* which are being worked on\*.\*  Parallel block creation, if you can achieve it, is a kind of blockchain “holy grail.”

All this optimization work is ongoing.  The scientific design is in place, and the relevant papers and specifications are mostly done.  It’s now more of an engineering and coding problem.

Hoskinson spoke of three additional, specific optimizations.  The first is Hydra, i.e., using separate payment state channels.  The goal is to have some version of Hydra running on the Cardano main network (mainnet) this year.  A lot of smart contract and microtransaction work can be done in these channels.  The second additional optimization is off-chain computing, where a result is returned to the main chain in a way that allows proof that the off-chain computation was done correctly.  This method requires identifying trusted parties, and maps well both to the delegated SPO model, and to the eUTxO model.  Finally, optimization can be done via sidechains (an “endless river,” as Hoskinson called it).  Ouroboros builds a strong root of trust, and once you have that you can pick a subset of SPOs engaged in consensus and use that subset to bootstrap separate side chains optimized for speed.  Each sidechain is centralized, permissioned (i.e., not just anyone can join), and potentially very fast, but backed and verified by the strong root of trust provided by the main decentralized, permissionless chain.

Speaking more generally, Hoskinson noted that microsummits are being planned to bring people together working in various areas, like DeFi.  New CIPs will come (there are three already, like one for read-only eUTxO).  DeFi Alliance will also be meeting.  Developer Discord has over 11,000 members.  Heavy investments will continue to be made in the Cardano ecosystem.  Hoskinson believes in a multi-model world in which there can be a mix of imperative and functional programming, and he understands that the latter (functional, in the eUTxO context) is new and therefore hard.  But he is committed to providing developers with tools, tutorials, SDKs, video content, and communities they will need.  Over the longer term, in terms of cost, security, throughput, and predictability, the Cardano model will prove cheaper than the Ethereum, and other account-based, models.  Hoskinson threw a number of barbs at Bitcoin and other maximalists, asking for collaboration.  And he offered a number of pleas for developer patience and recognition of the cold, hard truths about the right way to develop decentralized, secure blockchain models.",84.0,2022-01-03 23:44:28,0.95

What are your biggest non-price predictions for 2022?,"What are your biggest crypto technology and crypto community-related predictions for 2022?

Serious predictions only. Please **do NOT post price predictions** or shill specific coins.

A few of mine:

* Bitcoin, being super conservative, will not have any large updates.
* Ethereum's beacon chain merge will happen mid-year and be largely uneventful. The focus will shift even more to rollups.
* Ethereum Layer 2 will still be very fragmented. Shared liquidity across Layer 2s will begin to form late 2022 but will not have significant implementation before the end of the year.
* Meme coins will not be as popular in 2022 as in 2021. SHIB in particular will still not have a use case (especially given gas costs).
* At least one major CeFi or DeFi lending platform will be heavily investigated on suspicion of fraud or self-dealing.
* NFTs will still be disliked by everyone outside of the crypto community.
* The US SEC will not pass any major crypto regulation. At most, they'll classify a select few cryptoassets as securities as examples, and rest will decentralize to regulate themselves.
* Fewer US crypto investors will use non-stablecoins for crypto debit card purchases, mainly due to how much of a giant pain it is to do accounting for crypto taxes. More people will change their trading behavior simply to avoid the complexity of US taxes.
* At least one new minor country will adopt cryptocurrency as legal tender, and one major country (probably Turkey) will ban it.",50.0,2022-01-03 03:28:43,0.79
Crypto.org Chain vs Cronos,"So I've been reading up about the [Crypto.com](https://Crypto.com) ecosystem and I've been trying to figure out what exactly the point of having both of these products is. As far as I can tell the Main [Crypto.org](https://Crypto.org) chain is planning to become a direct Ethereum replacement/competitor whereas Cronos is an EVM Sidechain that is a temporary stand in until the main chain supports all the same functionality.

Does that mean Dapps like VVS will eventually be moved over to the Main Chain via some sort of merge or will they manually have to create a second version (copy/paste) on the other chain and try to get people/liquidity to switch.

"My bull case and why I'm all in on Ether, tell me how I'm wrong!","TLDR; Vitalink says he doesn't care much about price but the current roadmap certainly seems designed to increase the value of ETH.

1) **Eth price is driven by supply.** At least for ETH/BTC, current supply/demand seems to be a very good predictor of price. This is seen very clearly on the [halvings](https://coinmarketexpert.com/bitcoin-log-chart-analysis-a-thorough-investigation/) impact on bitcoin price. Predictable events drive up bitcoins price, simply because there is not enough coins to meet demand.

2) **Mining adds a lot of ether to supply.** POW mining is a commodity business. These industries tend to have very low margins(because competition is very fierce). This means most miners will have costs(hardware, operations and electricity) very close to the rewards they currently get. I believe most miners sell almost all of their mining rewards to cover these costs – adding supply. Currently adding \~4.6 million ether per year(ETH inflation is 4%).

3) **The merge will stop this supply** As the merge happens, mining will suddenly stop. Thus removing the biggest contributor to ether supply,

3.1) Another way to think of this is, Ether is currently paying for POW, once this is no longer needed, this value will instead contribute to ethers price.

4) **Ether is going to become a better store of value.** If ether goes deflationary due to high burn-rates, this will make ether a more interesting asset to hold. Further reducing supply in circulation.

5) **A lot more ether will be taken out of supply as trust in staking increases.** Since staking generates returns, I believe more ether will go in to staking over time. This may increase inflation of ether, but also removing ether from circulation. According to [this](https://medium.com/@business_40259/ethereum-2-0-may-achieve-1-deflation-every-year-despite-slow-upgrade-progress-9bc34f488a4b) article, 100 million ether staked would still generate 1.8% yearly returns to stakers. The central banks are starting to warm up to higher interest rates, but right now, this kind of ROI is not that easy to come by for liquid assets. If 100 million ether are staked, that would be 85% of all ether in existence.

7) **Increased costs of transactions will reduce supply.** I haven't been able to figure out how this works exactly, but my understanding is, increased transaction costs on the base layer will either be burned – decreasing supply or awarded to stakers –Increasing ROI on staking. This in turn will increase the number of staked coins, and that will also decrease supply.   

8) **Scaling ether will increase transaction-costs(on the base-layer)**. Contrary to popular belief, sharding and other scaling solutions will first alleviate congestion on the base-layer. But as transactions get cheaper, more transactions will happen. Currently, we see people are willing to pay 20-60 USD for transactions. Over time, we will see the same thing on layer 2(though possibly a bit lower fees due to price elasticity). 100s of layer 2 transactions can then be bundled and all their fees will be used to create a single transaction on the base-layer.

I've been struggling find good data on amongst others, daily burn rate, staking rewards and mining rewards. If someone can share that with me, I could quantify some of these statements better. I'd also love to know what i've gotten wrong here.",188.0,2021-12-27 20:47:04,0.91

"Discussing the obstacles of LRC, and why people think its a shit coin","Hello hello,

I recently saw a post over at r/ethereum and naturally dove into the comments. The top comment...

>**Hard facts:**  
>  
>**1.** **Loopring doesn't support smart contracts**  
>  
>**2. ""Ethereum 2.0"" is a deprecated name**  
>  
>**3. The merge won't affect scaling at all**

and others really showed the pessimism and shillish side of why people consider LRC a shit-coin. Besides the fact that some people just hate LRC b/c of GME-ties, I'm curious to know what the other factors are?

Other people mentioned that you can't build on LRC (yet) and that they are way behind in comparison their competitors (Arbiritum, ZKSync) in terms of development of zkrollup and so forth. 

Without being too bias, what do you think the real obstacles of LRC are? I always read good things  about LRC so would like to know the current weaknesses as well.

I'm pretty smooth btw, so go easy on me. ELI5 :) Thanks!

Those who stake their ETH now will be immensely rewarded this spring when the APR shoots up,"I think there is a misunderstanding concerning the rewards you currently get by staking ETH on the Beacon chain.

I've encountered quite a few people on this sub that were hesitant to stake their ETH, because of the low APR (currently around 4.5% for those who stake with a CEX) and the impossibility to sell if the price suddenly go up. I understand those concerns, but they are misguided, in my opinion. If you are planning to hold ETH long-term, it absolutely makes sense to stake it *right now*, before the merge.

Why? **Because the APR will go up dramatically immediately after the switch to proof-of-stake, and those who aren't staking already will have to wait several weeks, maybe even months, to join the party**.

You see, once the Ethereum blockchain switch to PoS, every tips will go to validators instead of miners, therefore growing their rewards. It's hard to estimate what will be the APR right after the switch, because we don't know what will be the network congestion in a few months, but current estimates vary between 8% and 25%.

Yeah, that's right, staking rewards will, at the very least, double.

Of course, many people will see this as an opportunity to grow their stack, so they will rush to stake on their CEX, or even with a decentralised protocol like Rocket Pool. Maybe a tiny fraction will even go the solo-staking route! But here is the problem : there is a daily limit on the number of validators that can get on the Beacon chain. I won't dive into the details, but in the past few weeks, you had to wait around 10 days to get your validator online.

This means that, when the APR goes above the double-digits, those who already staked their ETH will collect insane rewards, while those who waited will have to watch from the outside while the queue clears up.

Naturally, when the queue does clear, the APR will go down. But for a few weeks/months after the merge, stakers will have the time of their life. I think you should plan accordingly.

TL;DR : **Stake your ETH right now if you plan to hold long-term to get crazy high PoS rewards next spring.**

"Could Ethereum Hit $10,000 in 2022?","Here's how it could happen.

Key Points

\+ Ethereum could have several catalysts that could enable it to reach $10,000 in 2022.

\+ However, there are also multiple obstacles that could get in the way -- including delays with its big upgrade.

\+ The odds are likely against seeing Ethereum hit $10,000 next year, but not overwhelmingly against it.

It's been a great year for Ethereum (CRYPTO:ETH) even with the recent pullback. The price of the blockchain's ETH native token has soared more than 440%. With a surge in the final days of December, there's a good chance that Ethereum could end the year well above $4,000.

The cryptocurrency probably won't more than quintuple again in the new year. But could Ethereum hit $10,000 in 2022? 

What it would take

To reach $10,000 next year, Ethereum would need to soar more than 150%. That would put the cryptocurrency's market cap at over $720 billion. By comparison, Bitcoin's (CRYPTO:BTC) market cap currently stands at a little under $900 billion. 

So what would it take for Ethereum to deliver that kind of gain? One obvious potential catalyst is the major Ethereum 2.0 upgrade that's on the way. The merge of the blockchain's mainnet with the beacon chain is expected to complete in 2022. This will fully transition Ethereum from a proof-of-work model to a proof-of-stake model. 

A significant increase in the adoption of the Ethereum blockchain could also boost its token to $10,000 or more. Ethereum already ranks as the most widely used blockchain for smart contracts. It's not a stretch to envision the upcoming upgrade attracting a lot more developers over the next year.

Bad news for one or more of the top rivals to Ethereum could also help on this front. For example, a massive security breach or extended downtime for Cardano or Solana just might encourage developers to switch to Ethereum.

Key obstacles

There are plenty of things that could get in the way of Ethereum's price rising to $10,000 next year. For one thing, the general environment for cryptocurrencies must remain strong. A broader sell-off would almost certainly pull Ethereum down in its wake.

The shard chain phase of the Ethereum 2.0 upgrade has already been pushed back from 2022 into 2023. Any further major delays in the upgrade could prevent Ethereum from moving significantly higher in the new year.

There's also a possibility that Ethereum could lose ground to other blockchains even if the upgrade isn't delayed. Other blockchains also support smart contracts but with much faster transaction speeds and much lower gas fees.

Don't overlook the scenario where Ethereum's platform experiences a major security breach or lengthy technical problems. A bug in Ethereum's software was exploited only a few months ago. It wasn't the first time and might not be the last. 

Weighing the odds

So what are the chances that Ethereum will actually hit $10,000 in 2022? My best guess is that the odds are against it -- but not overwhelmingly so.

Since its launch in 2015, Ethereum has delivered gains of more than 160% in all but two years. Historically speaking, that might seem to make the cryptocurrency's prospects of reaching the target level pretty high. However, the bigger a cryptocurrency gets, the harder it becomes to grow as rapidly.

But the ingredients definitely exist to fuel another impressive year for Ethereum. Billionaire Mark Cuban predicts that the blockchain will be a monster winner in 2022 as new apps are built on it. He could very well be right. I suspect that Cuban could be right. Even if he's not, Ethereum could still deliver solid returns for investors over the long term.

ELI5 percentage staking rewards now and post-merge,"Hi all,

Maybe not an ELI5 per se, as I feel I understand some parts already, let's say an ELI15 :')

I joined rocketpool staking shortly after the launch because I've been interested in the non custodial liquid staking it provides as opposed to staking via centralised exchanges. I feel this fits the Ethereum ethos of transparency and decentralization I also value. 

I've monitored the stats, but am still not sure about how it all works, and I'm hoping some the more tech savy people here can clarify some parts or validate my assumptions.

I understand the APR percentage we get for normal staking (no node, simply getting rETH for our Eth) is lower than running a node ourselves because some of the profits go to the nodes as extra incentive. I've seen an APR of about 4,77% lately, but today I see it at 4,33%. I believe this is due to the fact that the commission rate is now at 20%, as opposed to 10% earlier, so incentivese nodes. In other words, the protocol wants more nodes, so the incentives are higher. Is this theory correct, and will APR go higher again once more nodes join and the commission goes back to say 10%?

Next to that, after the merge the APR is expected to go up due to tips and possibly MEV going to stakers next to regular issuance we now have. Will this immediately reflect in Rocketpools APR, or is there some mechanism in place where some of this will only go to nodes as extra incentive?

Thanks in advance for any responses!",21.0,2021-12-21 08:33:27,1.0
I joined Kintsugi today & this is my experience to run validator.,"Hi! etherstaker. I am validator.
Today, I joined Kintsugi testnet(Goodbye my weekends 🤣), so I wanna share my experience.

First, I am running on Cloud Environment.I have my validator's server, But I didn't want to be affected by Kintsugi. That's why I  chose cloud server.

# System spec

This is cloud server system spec.

Cloud : AWS 
EC2Instance : t2.large  
OS : Ubuntu 20.04 LTS  
CPU : 2 core  
Memory : 8GB memory  
SSD : 30GB

After install EL+CL Engine, System status.

CPU : 10 \~ 30% used  
Memory : 1.0 \~ 1.2GB used  
SSD : 17GB used (6GB is EL+CL data, 11GB is cache from build tools)

# Build

I basically follow this guide on my cloud environment & Ubuntu 20.04 LTS.   
(I use Geth+Prysm/LightHouse)

[https://hackmd.io/dFzKxB3ISWO8juUqPpJFfw](https://hackmd.io/dFzKxB3ISWO8juUqPpJFfw)

&#x200B;

**1. When you build go-ethereum, you need go version more than 1.15 version.**

I built go-ethereum(I don't use docker), I installed go using apt-get command.but this go version is 1.13. this version have issue when you build go-ethereum.

*""hash/maphash: missing dot in first element""*

I update go version, go1.17.5, I solve this issue.

&#x200B;

**2. When you Run Prysm Beacon : please check genesis.ssz & config.yaml file path.**

if you are running prysm beacon chain in other folder, you would have this error message.

*""Failed to read chain config file. config.yaml: no such file or directory""*

genesis.ssz & config.yaml is in ""/merge-testnets/kintsugi"" folder.please check this file path.

&#x200B;

**3. Connect Metamask to Remote Server(EC2)**

Geth basically open 8545 port only local port([127.0.0.1:8545](https://127.0.0.1:8545)).But I used EC2, so I need remote 8545 port to connect from Metamask(desktop, not cloud server)If you want to open public 8545 port, you can you this option on GETH.

*"" --http.addr* [*0.0.0.0*](https://0.0.0.0) *--http.corsdomain ""\*"" ""*

after this, you have to set RPC URL in your metamask.  
[http://127.0.0.1:8545](http://127.0.0.1:8545) \--> [http://18.210.110.30:8545](http://18.210.110.30:8545)    
([18.210.110.30](https://18.210.110.30) is sample IP, please input your ec2 instance ip.)

also please don't forget edit ""Inbound rules"" on your AWS EC2 settings.

Protocol : TCP, port Range : 8545, Source : [0.0.0.0/0](https://0.0.0.0/0)

It will allow connect to your desktop metamask to connect EC2's geth 8545 port.

&#x200B;

**4. When you install ethereal for validating, you need a 1.13 go version.**

I updated go version 1.17 to install geth, but I was installing ethereal for validation,

""GO111MODULE=on go get [github.com/wealdtech/ethereal](https://github.com/wealdtech/ethereal)""

it needs go version 1.13. if you have kind of this error message, please check your go version.

*go get : installing executables with 'go get' in module is deprecated.Use 'go install pkg@version' instead*

&#x200B;

**5. After Deposit, you have to use wallet folder created by ethereal tool.**

if you want to be validator, you need to create wallet using below command.

*# eth2-val-tools keystores --source-max=1 --source-mnemonic ""your mnemonic""*

after this command, eth2-val-tools makes assigned\_data folder,there are each 5 CL engines wallet folder.just copy this file, and use it.also if you are prysm user, --prysm-pass you have to use it for prysm wallet password.

&#x200B;

this is just my experience to run Kintsugi testnet on CloudServer(EC2). of course, almost my issue is already explained by doc, but I just wanna share my issue to prepare Kingsugi.

Finally, ETHDev, Thank you for giving grate opportunity to join ""First Merge Pubilc Testnet"".I run Kingsugi today, it seems working well. I can't imagine how dev work so hard.And We are staker, Now It's time to join Kintsugi Testnet!

**Frequently Asked Questions**

**Where's the best place to buy ETH?**

There are many centralized exchanges that support Ethereum. If you live in the US, the most popular exchanges are Coinbase, Gemeni and Kraken. Coinbase users can use Coinbase Pro for lower fees.

**When is Eth2 launching?**

Eth2 is a marketing term used to represent a number of updates to Ethereum. The Eth2 proof-of-stake chain first launched in December 2020. ""The Merge"", which is the event that will fully switch Ethereum's consensus to proof-of-stake, is estimated to be ready in early 2022, although there is no exact timeline. Other updates, such as data shards, will follow that update.

Visit [ethmerge.com](https://ethmerge.com/) to learn more about ""The Merge"".

**Do I need to do anything to update to Eth2? Will Eth2 create a new token?**

No, ETH holders *never* need to take any action to keep holding ETH. Ethereum users will be unaffected by the Eth2 upgrade. And the Eth2 updates will not create any new tokens.

**How can I stake my ETH?**

There are two ways that you can stake your ETH: by running your own validator, or providing your ETH to a staking pool.

* Running your own validator requires a modern computer and 32 ETH. Visit /r/ethstaker for more details
* Staking pools accept any amount of ETH. We recommend [Lido](https://lido.fi/) or [StakeWise](https://stakewise.io/)

**Why are Ethereum transaction fees so high?**

Like most blockchains, Ethereum fees are determined by supply-and-demand. The large demand to use Ethereum has pushed transaction fees quite high (however, fees were just a few cents only 2 years ago). Fees are especially high during market volatility, and during NFT drops.

**What is being done to lower Ethereum transaction fees?**

Ethereum fees are reduced by using layer-2 rollups. Rollups are scaling solutions that allow for significantly cheaper transactions, while still maintaining Ethereum's security.

Additionally, Eth2's data shards will make rollups even cheaper.

While rollups are cutting-edge technology being actively developed, a number are already live on Ethereum mainnet. Visit [l2beat.com](https://l2beat.com/) to learn more about rollups.

**What's the best wallet for Ethereum?**

The most popular tool for using decentralized applications is Metamask. However, for security reasons, we recommend using a hardware wallet such as a Trezor or Ledger.

Ethereum network upgrade (Hard fork) Arrow Glacier is happening tomorrow.,"In roughly 31 hours after this post is submitted, there will be a network upgrade (Or, a hard fork) happening on the Ethereum network. The last one of these was back in August 2021.

A live countdown can be seen here: https://ethernodes.org/arrow_glacier

This network upgrade will ship EIP-4345 (Which was proposed in October 2021) which will push the difficulty bomb delay to June 2022. This will ensure the network has enough time to ship the merge where the PoW chain will be depreciated and everything will be moved over to the PoS chain.

The difficulty bomb was put in place to ensure the PoW chain gets harder and harder to mine until it reaches a point where it can no longer be mined at all, essentially freezing the network as no blocks will be produced and forcing everyone off of it. It was put in place a long time ago to ease the transition from PoW to PoS.

This will be the 5th difficulty bomb delay to date, and most likely the last one as the merge gets closer to being completed.

**I am a node operator, what do I need to do?**

* Upgrade your execution node before the countdown shown in the before mentioned link is finished if you want to stay on the correct chain.

**I hold ETH, what do I need to do?** 

* Nothing! This is a non-contentious hard fork meaning *everyone* will be participating. There is no action required on your behalf. No matter where your ETH is before, it will continue being there after, and no you will not be getting any ""free"" tokens.",27.0,2021-12-08 12:26:17,0.86
Syscoin smart chain contract goes LIVE uniting top security and Decentralisation,"https://invezz.com/news/2021/12/06/syscoin-smart-contract-chain-goes-live-uniting-top-security-and-decentralization/

Phase 1 of the NEVM launch of Syscoin is now complete. The platform’s Bitcoin-secured Layer 1 for EVM smart contracts reached mainnet on block 1,317,500 today, Invezz learned from a press release.

Community members can now enjoy Bitcoin’s (BTC/USD) POW security and smart contract flexibility on a modular chain, developed with the objectives of infinite decentralization, affordability, and scalability.
The most secure foundation for all EVM Layer 2 advancements

Are you looking for fast-news, hot-tips and market analysis? Sign-up for the Invezz newsletter, today.

Syscoin’s unique approach deals with the main criticism of Bitcoin and Ethereum (ETH/USD). Its POW security is essentially a green energy solution thanks to merge mining. It reuses resources, which are being spent on Bitcoin’s gold standard security.

Syscoin will make it possible for all EVM-based projects to benefit from Syscoin NEVM’s scalability and low fees through solidity and full EVM compatibility, making ETH 2.0 promises unnecessary.
ETH projects can migrate to Syscoin and save on fees

Projects running on Ethereum can migrate to the Syscoin Platform and save on almost the full amount of transaction fees, passing the savings on to their users.

Jagdeep Sidhu, Syscoin’s Lead Core Developer, commented:

    Syscoin will utilize the best features of the top two cryptocurrencies, namely Bitcoin and Ethereum. Hence, Syscoin will provide the security offered by Bitcoin while maintaining the programmability of Ethereum. Scalable applications will be mounted on this system via ZKPs which will introduce our proposed decentralized cost model on Ethereum gas fees.

Phase 2 to bring lightning speeds through ZK rollups

Phase 2 of the NEVM launch of Syscoin will bring ZK rollups and an impressive boost to speeds of up to 210k TPS in the first quarter of next year. In Q3, the platform will introduce its proprietary Validium technology as part of phase 3. It will achieve a speed of 4 million TPS, ensuring the Syscoin Platform remains viable over the long term.
Partnerships with leading digital platforms

Among Syscoin’s partners in the NEVM initiative are Gold Standard DAO, a decentralized reserve currency backed by gold, Luxy, a powerful and intuitive NFT marketplace, Pegasys, the first DEX & AMM built on Syscoin’s NEVM, Orai, the world’s first AI Oracle blockchain, and more.",38.0,2021-12-07 06:58:43,1.0
"Smart Contracts Coming to Syscoin, Team Reveals Next Phases","The blockchain provider and development platform – Syscoin announced that its Layer 1 for Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) smart contracts has reached mainnet on block 1,317,500. With that development, it has fulfilled Phase One of the NEVM launch.

## Syscoin Combines Bitcoin And Ethereum

According to a press release seen by *CryptoPotato*, this upgrade will allow users of the platform to enjoy more benefits, such as enhanced security and flexibility of smart contracts on a modular chain. The Syscoin team added that this advancement laid the foundation for supporting the next EVM Layer 2.

The advancement happened when the platform reached its 1,317,500 block. The Syscoin team posted the news on Twitter, informing the public that the whole process will be completed in a couple of hours. It also warned users to refrain from sending SYS (the native token of the protocol) during the update.

>.[@syscoin](https://twitter.com/syscoin?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw) block 1,317,500 has now been reached.  
All miners will now shut down and upgrade to 4.3. This will take a couple of hours to complete.  
When the [\#smartcontract](https://twitter.com/hashtag/smartcontract?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw) chain is deployed successfully, we will update everyone.  
Please refrain from sending [$SYS](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24SYS&src=ctag&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw) during the update  
— Syscoin (@syscoin) [December 6, 2021](https://twitter.com/syscoin/status/1467805315118759937?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)

The team outlined that its POW security has a green focus thanks to the merge-mining technology of both Bitcoin and Ethereum. With the help of its Solidity and EVM compatibility, Syscoin managed to set the stage for all EVM-based projects, including Ethereum itself.

As a result of the development, projects running on Ethereum can migrate to the Syscoin platform and save almost all transaction fees. In turn, those savings could be passed on to their user bases. Jagdeep Sidhu – Syscoin’s Lead Core Developer – gave further details:

Subsequently, Syscoin explained that the upcoming Phase Two will bring ZK-Rollups, which could boost the speed to 210K TPS in Q1 of 2022. Phase Three should follow in Q3 with the implementation of Vanadium technology, which could enhance the number to 4 million TPS.

## Syscoin Provided Stablecoin Bridge

At the end of last year, the project [partnered](https://cryptopotato.com/trusttoken-and-syscoin-partner-on-a-stablecoin-bridge/) with the stablecoin platform – TrustToken. The goal of the collaboration was to speed up payments and provide other solutions to Ethereum’s blockchain. Additionally, the five stablecoins of TrustToken (TUSD, TGBP, THKD, TCAD, and TAUD) started running on Syscoin’s network and became available for users.

"Smart Contracts Coming to Syscoin, Team Reveals Next Phases","***Smart contracts are set to go live on Syscon, while the team reveals details of its upcoming phases.***

The blockchain provider and development platform – Syscoin announced that its Layer 1 for Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) smart contracts has reached mainnet on block 1,317,500. With that development, it has fulfilled Phase One of the NEVM launch.

## Syscoin Combines Bitcoin And Ethereum

According to a press release seen by *CryptoPotato*, this upgrade will allow users of the platform to enjoy more benefits, such as enhanced security and flexibility of smart contracts on a modular chain. The Syscoin team added that this advancement laid the foundation for supporting the next EVM Layer 2.

The advancement happened when the platform reached its 1,317,500 block. The Syscoin team posted the news on Twitter, informing the public that the whole process will be completed in a couple of hours. It also warned users to refrain from sending SYS (the native token of the protocol) during the update.

>.[@syscoin](https://twitter.com/syscoin?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw) block 1,317,500 has now been reached.  
All miners will now shut down and upgrade to 4.3. This will take a couple of hours to complete.  
When the [\#smartcontract](https://twitter.com/hashtag/smartcontract?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw) chain is deployed successfully, we will update everyone.  
Please refrain from sending [$SYS](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24SYS&src=ctag&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw) during the update  
— Syscoin (@syscoin) [December 6, 2021](https://twitter.com/syscoin/status/1467805315118759937?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)

The team outlined that its POW security has a green focus thanks to the merge-mining technology of both Bitcoin and Ethereum. With the help of its Solidity and EVM compatibility, Syscoin managed to set the stage for all EVM-based projects, including Ethereum itself.

As a result of the development, projects running on Ethereum can migrate to the Syscoin platform and save almost all transaction fees. In turn, those savings could be passed on to their user bases. Jagdeep Sidhu – Syscoin’s Lead Core Developer – gave further details:

>”Syscoin will utilize the best features of the top two cryptocurrencies, namely Bitcoin and Ethereum. Hence, Syscoin will provide the security offered by Bitcoin while maintaining the programmability of Ethereum. Scalable applications will be mounted on this system via ZKPs, which will introduce our proposed decentralized cost model on Ethereum gas fees.”

Subsequently, Syscoin explained that the upcoming Phase Two will bring ZK-Rollups, which could boost the speed to 210K TPS in Q1 of 2022. Phase Three should follow in Q3 with the implementation of Vanadium technology, which could enhance the number to 4 million TPS.

## Syscoin Provided Stablecoin Bridge

At the end of last year, the project [partnered](https://cryptopotato.com/trusttoken-and-syscoin-partner-on-a-stablecoin-bridge/) with the stablecoin platform – TrustToken. The goal of the collaboration was to speed up payments and provide other solutions to Ethereum’s blockchain. Additionally, the five stablecoins of TrustToken (TUSD, TGBP, THKD, TCAD, and TAUD) started running on Syscoin’s network and became available for users. Speaking on the matter was once again Jagdeep Sidhu:

**Frequently Asked Questions**

**Where's the best place to buy ETH?**

There are many centralized exchanges that support Ethereum. If you live in the US, the most popular exchanges are Coinbase, Gemeni and Kraken. Coinbase users can use Coinbase Pro for lower fees.

**When is Eth2 launching?**

Eth2 is a marketing term used to represent a number of updates to Ethereum. The Eth2 proof-of-stake chain first launched in December 2020. ""The Merge"", which is the event that will fully switch Ethereum's consensus to proof-of-stake, is estimated to be ready in early 2022, although there is no exact timeline. Other updates, such as data shards, will follow that update.

Visit [ethmerge.com](https://ethmerge.com/) to learn more about ""The Merge"".

**Do I need to do anything to update to Eth2? Will Eth2 create a new token?**

No, ETH holders *never* need to take any action to keep holding ETH. Ethereum users will be unaffected by the Eth2 upgrade. And the Eth2 updates will not create any new tokens.

**How can I stake my ETH?**

There are two ways that you can stake your ETH: by running your own validator, or providing your ETH to a staking pool.

* Running your own validator requires a modern computer and 32 ETH. Visit /r/ethstaker for more details
* Staking pools accept any amount of ETH. We recommend [Lido](https://lido.fi/) or [StakeWise](https://stakewise.io/)

**Why are Ethereum transaction fees so high?**

Like most blockchains, Ethereum fees are determined by supply-and-demand. The large demand to use Ethereum has pushed transaction fees quite high (however, fees were just a few cents only 2 years ago). Fees are especially high during market volatility, and during NFT drops.

**What is being done to lower Ethereum transaction fees?**

Ethereum fees are reduced by using layer-2 rollups. Rollups are scaling solutions that allow for significantly cheaper transactions, while still maintaining Ethereum's security.

Additionally, Eth2's data shards will make rollups even cheaper.

While rollups are cutting-edge technology being actively developed, a number are already live on Ethereum mainnet. Visit [l2beat.com](https://l2beat.com/) to learn more about rollups.

**What's the best wallet for Ethereum?**

The most popular tool for using decentralized applications is Metamask. However, for security reasons, we recommend using a hardware wallet such as a Trezor or Ledger.

Decoupling of Crypto from Stocks | 12.1 Crypto Market Update and Investing Report," OVERVIEW

* Market Insight: Decoupling
* Market update (BTC, SOL, LUNA, EGLD)

# Market Insight: Decoupling

Crypto markets continue to chug along while the stock market struggles. The S&P 500 is down -5.06% since hitting new highs on Nov 22nd. Stocks have been hit hard with news of monetary policy change and Omnicron, the newest Covid variant. A 5% decrease in stocks is considered a significant drop. Volume is increasing significantly during the selloff which adds to the intensity of the drop. The volatility index (VIX) is up to 31.13 in a 9-month high.

In the same period TOTAL (Total crypto market) has remained flat. Some major Altcoins have been strong in the past week. (LUNA +50%, ALGO +5.6, ETH +5.4%, MATIC +12.6%).

&#x200B;

[S&P 500 1D chart](https://preview.redd.it/o5fz2v9zy2381.png?width=705&format=png&auto=webp&s=6d1fe815b061ba9327f45b471027cac1f561ccd4)

Breaking from historic fashion, the crypto market is continuing to show strength despite stock market lulls. It may be too early to talk about decoupling of the stock market and crypto, but the past week has added a lot of promise to the proposition. There is growing evidence that some investors are seeking alternate investment vehicles due to stock market fears and other markets such as real estate are reaching extreme valuations. It’s early but the signs are promising. If more investors start entering the space, prices and volatility could increase quickly. Below is the SPY vs TOTAL chart (total crypto market), which will be an interesting chart to keep an eye on for the upcoming weeks. The downtrend on this chart began in Mar 2020, showing crypto as a better investment since that point. A break in this trend could help signal when a crypto bull market is over.

# Market Update

* · Bitcoin (BTC) continues to fluctuate between the 59k resistance and a well-tested trendline that currently sits around the 56k area. BTC currently at 56.8k
* · Ethereum (ETH) is showing signs of being oversold on the daily charts after a 15% run-up in 5 days. A lot of news has been coming out of ETH recently and volume seems to be increasing. ETH has high potential of reaching new highs if the strong market continues. Expect a possible retest of the trendline at 4.2k in the short term
* · Solana (SOL) is up 27% since Friday and is testing the $220 resistance. Stochastics is in the oversold area on the 4H charts. Just like ETH, a retest of the trendline could be in its short-term future
* · Total Market Cap (TOTAL) is down -.69% to $2.56T. TOTAL has tested 2.63T three times in the past three weeks.
* · TOTAL3 (TOTAL – ETH/BTC) is flat today showing more funds are moving into altcoins vs BTC
* · Elrond (EGLD) is showing a strong breakout of a downtrend on the 4H charts but the stochastic is reaching oversold area. EGLD has gone down 31% since Nov 22nd after a large runup due to the release of the Maiar Exchange. This could create an entry opportunity.
* · Notable Gainers/Losers from watchlist:
* o LUNA +7.4%

# NOOBIES: Dr. Gavin Wood

Dr. Gavin James Wood is a British computer engineer and the co-founder of Ethereum alongside Vitalik Buterin. He laid the first stone in smart contracts through the creation of Solidity, which to this day, is the most widely used language in crypto. He described Ethereum as “one computer for the entire planet.” It was rumored he engineered Ethereum in a matter of weeks.

His recent work in crypto includes the creation of Polkadot and founding the Web3 Foundation. Polkadot, which has recently gone live, is described as an interconnected internet of blockchains which will facilitate the exchange of information in a trustless manner. Wood designed Polkadot after seeing the flaws in Ethereum. [This past report goes deeper into Polkadot](https://medium.com/p/ef1f6ea1833b/edit).

Web3 was created to redefine the structure between blockchain and the web. It aims to work towards decentralizing web architecture and returning the internet back to the users. Grants are awarded to projects that facilitate the grounds to a decentralized web through the Web3 foundation. Web3 foundation with the aid of Polkadot is positioned to bring on a new future with the integration of blockchain technology and the web.

Wood remains of the most influential personas in crypto and one that I recommend our community follows. If you would like to learn more about Dr. Wood, check out his self-written [Zoolander-like webpage](https://gavwood.com/). After a good laugh, check out his some of his insightful speeches on Youtube.

I want to remind everyone that I am not here to shill any coins or projects. I wish they paid me good money to shill legit projects but that is not the case. I am going to have preferences but this in no way means these projects will outperform others, I merely mention them to bring them to your attention in hopes that you do deeper research.

Don’t forget to share what you find and help add value to our community.

What is Ethereum? A guide for beginners,"I wanted to create this post as we often get told that BTC and ETH are safe investments. However, I believe that if you put your money into something you should understand the underlying technology behind this asset. This is some research on the Ethereum network and it's native ETH token aimed at giving beginners a primer. I'm uploading this to ascertain my own degree of knowledge so if anyone sees any issues or over-simplifications please let me know! I hope to do this with other popular networks. A lot of this information was gathered from reading various articles on the web. Special mention for the section on Layer 2 scaling solutions - most of this information was gained from watching the Finematics Youtube channel. 

**Ethereum Network** 

* Decentralised, open source blockchain with smart contract functionality 
* Can be through of as 3 layers built on top of each other:

1. Ethereum blockchain layer 
2. Smart contracts which use the programming language Solidity 
   1. For example this could include: Mark and Bob send 5 Eth to Jack, if this occurs then automatically send 2 Eth from Jack to Alice 
   2. Smart contracts may also be leveraged to create new tokens 
   3. An issue with smart contracts is that since the code is visible to all, bugs are obvious and are not quickly fixed. This has been exploited once before in the 2016 attack on DAO 
3. dApps, DeFi, etc. which Ethereum users can interact with 

* It currently runs using a PoW blockchain which is slow and has resulted in high transaction fees – this is currently being remedied with the Ethereum 2.0 update which will transition to a PoS system
* Each node within the Ethereum network communicates with a small number of nodes within the network known as its peers
   * When a node wants to include a new transaction in the blockchain it sends the transaction to its peers and this is then propagated throughout the network 
   * Certain nodes (miners) maintain a list of all new transactions and use them to create new blocks, which are then sent to the network 
   * As the network is non-hierarchical a node can receive competing blocks, which may form competing chains 
   * The network achieves consensus by following the “longest-chain rule” – stating that the chain with the most blocks at any given time is the canonical chain 
* *Ethereum Virtual Machine* = Runtime environment for transactions executed in Ethereum, enabling network Conesus 

&#x200B;

**Ethereum 2.0** 

* This is a major upgrade to the Ethereum network set to be released by \~2022 
* The main purpose is to increase transaction throughput for the network from its current \~15 transactions/second to up to \~10,000/second 
* It aims to achieve this via *SHARDING* – the process of splitting work into multiple blockchains and then having them all share a common PoS blockchain. This means that any malicious tampering with any singular chain which would require tampering with the common consensus from the main chain (too difficult) 
* It will be launched in 3 phases:

1. Phase 0/Beacon Chain = Launched on 1/12/2020 with creation of the Beacon Chain, a PoS blockchain that will act as the central coordination and consensus hub of Eth 2.0 
2. Phase 1/The merge = Merge of the Beacon chain with the current Eth network, transitioning the consensus mechanism from PoW to PoS 
3. Phase 2/Shard chains = Implementation of shard chains with Eth 1.0 set to become one of the shards of Eth 2.0, with a total of 64 blockchains 

&#x200B;

**Gas** 

* This is a unit of account within the EVM which is used in the calculation of a transaction fee (the amount of ETH that must be sent to pay the miner who includes the transaction on the blockchain) 
* The higher the gas price the more incentive the miner has to include the transaction in their block 
* Gas prices are denominated in Gwei (1 Gwei = 10-9 ETH) 

&#x200B;

**Applications** 

* ERC-20 token Standard 
   * This allows for the creation of fungible tokens on the Ethereum blockchain 
   * It utilises smart contracts and provides functionality such as transferring tokens between nodes
   * Fees to send ERC-20 tokens must be paid with Ether 
* NFTs 
* DeFI
   * Offers traditional financial instruments in a decentralised way, free from any one centralised authority 
   * These can be accessed via web-based extensions such as MetaMask, allowing the user to directly interact with the Ethereum blockchain 
   * Examples include MakerDao, Compound, Uniswap 

&#x200B;

**Layer 1 vs Layer 2 scaling** 

* Layer 1 vs Layer 2 Scaling 
   * Layer 1 represents the base consensus layer of the algorithm, and Layer 2 solutions don’t require any changes in the consensus layer, but by anchoring to Layer 1 they leverage its security 
   * Layer 1 of Ethereum can process \~15 transactions/second, layer 2 solutions could expand this to 2000-4000 tx/second 
   * The benefits of layer 2 solutions is that they greatly improve transaction speed and transaction throughout whilst reducing gas fees \\

&#x200B;

* Channels 
   * These allow participants to exchange multiple transactions off-chain whilst submitting only two transactions to the base layer 
   * The most popular type = state channels (and their subtype payment channels) 
   * There are 2 problems with channels - 1) they don’t offer open participation, 2) channels are application-specific and cannot be used to scale general-purpose smart contracts 
   * The main project leveraging state channels on Ethereum is Raiden 

&#x200B;

* Plasma 
   * This is a framework for building scalable applications on Ethereum 
   * It leverages the use of smart contracts and Markle trees to enable the creation of unlimited numbers of child chains (copies of the parent Ethereum blockchain) 
   * This offloading of transactions increases throughput + speed 
   * An issue with this - 1) people have to wait a long time to withdraw their funds from Layer 2, 2\_ cannot be used to scale general-purpose smart contracts 
   * OMG network have their own version of Plasma known as MoreViable Plasma
   * Polygon is another example of a platform using their own version of Plasma

* Sidechains 
   * These are Ethereum-compatible, independent blockchains with their own consensus mechanisms and security 
   * Interoperability is possible by using the EVM, meaning that contracts deployed to the Ethereum base layer can be directly deployed to the side chain 
   * An example is xDai 

&#x200B;

* Rollups 
   * These provide scaling by bundling/“rolling up” side chain transactions into a single transactions and generating a cryptographic proof 
   * This proof is known as SNARK (Succinct non-interactive argument of knowledge) 
   * Only the SNARK is submitted to the base layer 
   * Rollups allow all transaction + execution states to be handled in the maintain, whilst the Ethereal maintain stores the transaction data 
   * 2 types - Zk rollups & Optimistic Rollups 
   * Zk rollups are faster and more efficient, but do not provide an easy way for existing smart contracts to migrate to Layer 2. The 2 major Zk rollups = Loopring + Diversifi 
   * Optimistic Rollups run an EVM-compatible virtual machine (OVM) which facilitates the execution of smart contracts that exist on the Ethereum base chain. Major one = Optimism",91.0,2021-12-02 01:30:09,0.88

Rollup-centric Ethereum roadmap: November 2021 update,"Overwhelming demand for the Ethereum network combined with by-design constrained supply has in recent months led to skyrocketing gas fees. This has had a knock-on effect with rollups also seeing significant increases. Currently, AMM swaps cost \~$5 on optimistic rollups and \~$1 on zk rollups — which is too damn high. Do note that these are still very early beta & unoptimized rollups. Neither Optimistic Ethereum nor Arbitrum One have implemented data compression. With compression, we could see these fees go down by 10x. ZK rollups do have very efficient compression implemented, but early rollups have a different issue — not enough activity. The good news is as activity goes up, the transaction fees on zkRs will decrease significantly — especially STARK rollups. But optimizations and building activity will take time, and even then, it’s not enough. 

Back to Ethereum, the long-term solution has always been data sharding, but with the community and developers opting to prioritize The Merge instead, has been pushed back to late 2023. We need shorter-term solutions. Vitalik’s details an update to [how we can unlock as much data availability for rollups as quickly as possible](https://notes.ethereum.org/@vbuterin/data_sharding_roadmap). For details, please read that. Here, I’ll just state my quick (PS: lol, maybe it’s not so quick after all) opinion & speculation on the matter. 

With rollups, especially ZKRs, the whole “TPS” thing is irrelevant. But for illustrative purposes, I’ll add what the average TPS at each step would be for a ERC20 transaction. For dYdX transactions, multiply this number by 3. (Yet another point of evidence that TPS is useless — one would have thought highly complex derivative trades with cross margin, oracle updates multiple times a second etc. would cost less than a simple ERC20 transfer.)

# Step 1: EIP-4488/90

You can read about [my thoughts on EIP-4488 here](https://polynya.medium.com/why-calldata-gas-cost-reduction-is-crucial-for-rollups-30e663577d3a). Since then, [we also have EIP-4490](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/pull/4490), which is a simpler alternative. These have broad community support, and the timeline is ASAP. On Friday’s Core Devs call, both will be discussed. EIP-4488 is the preferred solution, but a little more complex, so client implementers will have to decide if it will impact The Merge timelines. If it turns out that EIP-4488 will delay The Merge at all, the alternative is EIP-4490, which is a one-line change. Let’s wait and see, but I’m optimistic one of these will happen pre-Merge. As for timelines, we’ll also find out tomorrow. My best guess would be Jan/Feb 2022. 

EIP-4488 will decrease calldata costs by 5.33x (EIP-4490 is 2.66x), though throughput only sees a minor bump to 5,000 TPS. How much this will decrease fees by is a complex matter (see my post above), but at constant demand, we should expect \~5x for optimistic rollups. 

# Step 1.5: Optimized rollups

This is not part of the Ethereum roadmap, but more about the rollups side. Still, it’s crucial information. Through the course of 2022, I’d expect rollups to continue developing. Arbitrum Nitro will introduce the first implementation of calldata compression. No timelines are given, but I’d speculate Nitro is coming early 2022. Optimism is also working on compression. I’d expect both to continue iterating, and delivering mature compression by the end of 2022. As mentioned above, this can lead to a 10x further decrease in cost over EIP-4488. So, we’re looking at a 50x reduction in a year’s time. 

With ZKRs, things are a little more complicated — it totally depends on how much activity there is. If we see a ZKR take off in a big way, the verification costs will essentially be amortized to negligible, and the calldata costs will dominate. So, your dYdX transaction will cost only 16.1 gas, and the baseline ERC20 transaction 48 gas. 10x is definitely possible — especially for STARK rollups, so once again, we’re at 50x from today. 

# Step 2: Few data shards

Instead of implementing to full data sharding spec, we’ll first start off with a fewer number of shards, e.g. 4 shards. As a side note, I’ve talked about this off and on in casual comments, and [wrote a short post about it](https://ethresear.ch/t/gradual-sharding-rollout/10320). 

With 4 shards, in addition to EIP-4488/90, we’re now looking at \~10,000 TPS. As for cost, we’ll see dedicated fee markets on data shards starting from zero, and I expect transaction fees to more than halve. It’s unclear to me how the execution layer’s calldata market will work in tandem with the new shards, though. Speculation on timelines: it’s implied to be similar in scope to Altair. Given that, I’d say early 2023 is a reasonable target. 

# Step 3: 64 data shards

This is the good old data shards v1 spec as we have come to know and love! We’ll see capacity increase all the way to 85,000 TPS, or 250,000 TPS for dYdX type transactions. This is where almost all rollup calldata is settled on data shards with dedicated fee markets, and I’d expect transaction fees to absolutely plummet. It’s hard to say by how much, so let’s take a conservative 8.5x (to go with capacity). 

When does this happen? Again, totally speculating here: late 2023 is possible, but conservatively, it could be early 2024 due to Step 2 coming first. 

This means, at constant demand, we can expect transaction fees on rollups to plummet by over 1,000x from the status quo on rollups today. But, of course, this is a very naïve illustration. It doesn’t mean that fees are going to be $0.0001 or something — of course there’ll be massive demand induced by these lower fees. On the flip side, a lot of the overwhelming demand for Ethereum is due to speculative activity in a bull market, which will almost certainly vanish in a bear market. Indeed, just 5 months ago, gas price was 10 gwei, and swaps even on unoptimized rollups were $0.30 or so. So, it’s really hard to say where thing settle. But the important thing to know is that we’ll have massive capacity with very low fees on rollups in a couple of years.

# Step 4:  Data availability sampling

DAS is a magical solution that lets you verify data availability with only a fraction of the data. So, to verify a 1 MB shard block, you only need to download a few kBs! This greatly increases security to the point that even a 51% attack is insufficient. Expect DAS to roll out through 2024 in stages. After this step, sharding is done!

# Speculative steps: Expanding data shards

This is obviously much more speculative, and not part of Vitalik’s post. After DAS, sharding is done. But, just like Ethereum has increased its gas limits incrementally, we can expect each shard’s capacity to increase over time as bandwidth improves. According to Nielsen’s Law, we should expect 50x bandwidth — I don’t quite buy that, but the point is there are massive gains to be had over time. Additionally, as the networking layer matures, as we have more validators, and it gets cheaper to run the Beacon Chain (ZK-Beacon Chain, anyone!?), we can also add more shards. As we have speculated before, we could have dozens of millions of TPS by the end of the decade, and this does not even account for various new breakthroughs. 

(For those wondering — what happened to “Ethereum 2.0” execution shards? My speculation is those will never happen, and Ethereum shards will be data-only. Rollups & data sharding in tandem are simply a far superior solution than execution sharding. Instead, the Ethereum execution layer will head straight to zkEVM sometime mid-2020s, and then, if required, we can have zkEVM-shards in late-2020s. Totally speculating here, though. I know some still want to make execution shards happen.)

# Elephant in the room: volitions

 But, of course, the beauty of the modular architecture means that ZKRs need not wait for Ethereum’s roadmap to unfold. They can simply use alternative DA solutions — at a trade-off to security, of course. Decentralized validium options are still more secure than sidechains and alt-L1s. So, zkSync 2.0 will have zkPorter in early 2022. StarkNet will also have a range of DA options, including permissionless & decentralized solutions unlike the current StarkEx DAC. The volition system for StarkNet will be introduced in January 2022, though we don’t know when the first in this “range of DA options” will roll out — probably later in Q1 2022.

# Endnotes

There’s a lot more in Vitalik’s blog post, including how expired history will be handled in a data sharded world. Highly recommend it! I’m more excited than ever for Ethereum’s massively ambitious rollup-centric roadmap — as I’ve said many times before, in collaboration with rollups and alt-DA layers, this is the ONLY WAY the blockchain industry scales to global ubiquity. However, it’s worth remembering that the transition to rollup-centric Ethereum remains a years-long journey. While that may seem like a long time, remember that this is the absolute bleeding edge of blockchain tech, and in the new paradigm, we’re still early. We’re now at the same point with rollups & data shards where Bitcoin was in 2009 and Ethereum was in 2015. Enjoy the ride!",294.0,2021-11-25 21:06:43,0.99
Why calldata gas cost reduction is crucial for rollups,"We will be discussing the draft EIP to decrease calldata gas costs: [Call data gas cost reduction with total calldata limit — HackMD](https://hackmd.io/@vbuterin/rollup_data_space_extension). (PS: [EIP-4488 it is](https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/eip-4488-transaction-calldata-gas-cost-reduction-with-total-calldata-limit/7555)!) I’m not going to dive into technical and implementation details, but I’ll definitely dive into what this means for rollups and the end users. Please note that everything here is purely my personal opinion on the matter.

First, a brief recap of rollups. They execute transactions, generate proofs, and compress transaction data to commit to Ethereum. For all rollups running at scale, the compressed transaction data component becomes the dominant gas cost as the primary bottleneck. (Addendum: the definition of “at scale” varies by the nature of rollup and their respective fixed batch costs. More on this later.) This is what is committed to Ethereum as calldata, and as a result, reducing cost of calldata has a dramatic impact on the end users’ transaction fees on rollups.

**Tl;dr**: this EIP will reduce transaction fees on rollups by \~5x, while the limit will ensure that it remains safe. Given how transaction fees & blockchain demand work, I believe the net impact will be far greater than 5x. 

There’s been a lot of talk about reducing calldata this week. [Louis from StarkWare](https://twitter.com/GuthL/status/1462658814226882565) has a great thread about it, responding to a prompt from [@PhABCD](https://twitter.com/PhABCD/status/1462750431961128968). I had [briefly covered the cost implications](https://twitter.com/epolynya/status/1462766347373318146), but will dive into it more here. 

Over the last year or so, we have seen exponential demand for Ethereum smart contract transactions, whether it be DeFi, NFT or memecoins, which has led to skyrocketing gas prices. Unfortunately, because rollups must compete with these use cases, there’s been unnecessary contention, leading to calldata being overpriced in absolute terms. This draft EIP effectively subsidizes rollups so they can make better use of Ethereum blockspace. With significantly lower costs on rollups, this will also reduce the cost of DeFi, NFT, memecoins and other smart contracts on rollups, hopefully incentivizing more people & developers to migrate from Ethereum mainnet to rollups. This will, in turn, lead to reducing demand and gas prices on mainnet, which in turn will further decrease transaction fees on rollups. Hopefully, this will kickstart a positive feedback cycle and incentivize transition to rollup-centric usage of Ethereum. 

The question then becomes — but this will surely **lead to a bloated chain, right?** This is where the cap on the max calldata there can be per block comes in. Today, the average target for calldata is 937,500 bytes, assuming the entirety of Ethereum is calldata and nothing else. With this EIP, the max calldata is capped at 1,048,576 bytes. So, really, when we consider worst-case scenarios, nothing much changes from now. What will happen is the ratio between calldata and other transactions will increase, thus leading to larger blocks. But as covered, this is still within bounds, and history expiry as proposed by [EIP-4444](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4444) will mitigate this in the future. I’m oversimplifying, of course, please read the EIP for more details. 

The other concern to be addressed is — **will it delay The Merge?** The early feedback I’ve seen is that this is a relatively simple change, not much more complex than [Arrow Glacier’s bomb defusal](https://blog.ethereum.org/2021/11/10/arrow-glacier-announcement/) so it should not impact The Merge’s timeline — [which is getting close to spec freeze](https://blog.ethereum.org/2021/11/22/finalized-no-32/) — by more than a week or two. Of course, there’ll be a lot of discussion about this in [the upcoming Ethereum Core Devs call](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=js4HLK4MyQI), and we’ll see clarity around timelines emerge then. But generally, it’s possible we can have this EIP rolled out as early as Q1 2022, before The Merge. The other possibilities are with The Merge itself, or the fork after The Merge. But given the urgency of the situation, we should try to make the pre-Merge fork happen. Personally, I’d argue that reducing transaction fees on rollups by 5x actually has a much greater impact in the short term, so any small delays in The Merge will be well worth it. What do you think? 

**How much will transaction fees on rollups reduce?** Tl;dr: by 5x or so, but this is a complex topic. If you want to get into the weeds, read on, otherwise feel free to skip this section. 

Fees on rollups have three components broadly: fees by the rollups, batch/verification fees, and transaction data (as calldata). Only the calldata will be affected, but as mentioned above, for a rollup running at scale, this will be 99% of the fees. But, of course, rollups are not yet running at scale, so let’s look at a few examples. 

The last [Uniswap V3 trade on Optimistic Ethereum](https://optimistic.etherscan.io/tx/0x64c67e9771e8d8c824d01ccda2911ebf133a80b13230c4e8717750e17a30b49d) had a total transaction fee of $2.95 (I’m using OE as their recent EVM-equivalence upgrade makes comparisons easier). The L2 component is relatively negligible. While they don’t break it down, I’ll assume the L1 gas is largely calldata at 6,290 gas (this is not strictly accurate, but for illustrative purposes in this post, I’ll make the assumption). At the time of this transaction, this amounted to $1.95. As an early rollup, they have a buffer, where each transaction is charged 1.5x to mitigate gas price volatility etc. I believe this is far too high, and will reduce down to close to 1x over time as rollups scale up and mature. Given that, after this EIP, the cost for a transaction fee could potentially reduce to only $0.36. 

Now, of course, that’s a naïve illustration. In reality, the matter is far more complex. For example, if we see more developers & users move from Ethereum to Optimistic Ethereum to benefit from this massive reduction in costs (from $50 swaps to $0.5!) we could see gas prices reduce on Ethereum, which could ignite a positive feedback loop as discussed above. On the other hand, at sub-$0.5 there’ll surely be higher demand from outside the Ethereum ecosystem. As long as within the rollup’s limits, this won’t impact the L2 fees. However, the rollups could start bidding up the gas price if they start using a significant amont of calldata, but on the fourth hand, rollups’ batched transactions will be far more efficient than users directly interacting on Ethereum. On the fifth hand, I haven’t even mentioned calldata compression techniques, which ORs like Optimistic Ethereum & Arbitrum One have yet to implement, which could lead to another 10x reduction in costs. So, potentially, **with compression, we could have AMM swaps on ORs sub-$0.05**! Arbitrum has their first implementations of calldata compression rolling out with Nitro, and the Optimism team is also working on it. Anyway, the point is — there are many dynamics at play! It’s nigh impossible to predict where fees and demand will finally land, but you get the picture — much lower transaction fees on rollups!

Things get a little more complicated when we consider ZK rollups. While optimized ORs have a relatively low batch costs, it’s more expensive to verify the validity proof. Especially for STARKs, this costs \~5 million gas. If we look at the case of dYdX, we’ve seen batches with 13,000 transactions. This leads to a 384 gas cost per transaction. (Note: for the user, dYdX has zero gas fees, as it’s abstracted from the user, but there’s a gas cost that dYdX pays.) Due to ZKRs’ highly efficient compression techniques, and the nature of dYdX making it particularly compressible, the calldata cost is actually only 86 gas. With this EIP, this calldata cost will reduce to 16.1 gas. But overall, the transaction fee will reduce from 470 gas to 400 gas. At the time of writing this post, that would be from $0.15 to $0.125. Not the most dramatic improvement, but here’s where things get interesting. The batch cost is poly-log, so practically fixed. If dYdX’s activity increases 100x, the batch costs will decrease to only 4–5 gas per transaction, in which case the calldata reduction would have a huge impact. If dYdX did do 100x the TPS they are doing today, the total on-chain cost will reduce to only 21 gas, which is $0.007. At this point, the bottleneck becomes prover costs for the ZKR as much as on-chain gas fees! I should also note that PLONK-rollups like zkSync have much lower verification costs, with a fixed batch cost of \~0.5M gas, so they need less \~10x less activity to amortize the batch cost. On the other hand, they do have higher prover costs, and STARKs have other benefits, and as demonstrated above at scale the gas costs become negligible any way. More on [this fascinating topic here](https://polynya.medium.com/the-dynamics-around-validity-proof-amortization-519e9ae291c1). E**ither way, the point is — as ZKRs start ramping up activity, we’re easily looking at $0.0X transaction fees post this EIP.**

**What about capacity?** If we assume that Ethereum is 100% rollup transactions, then the peak capacity for rollups is not going to change much. In line with the max calldata limit as per the EIP, we’re looking at a \~12% increase. So, for optimized, compressed 16 byte transactions, this is 5,000 TPS across rollups. For highly compressive usecases like dYdX, 15,000 TPS. I believe this is a ton of headroom given all blockchain activity combined is less than 1,000 TPS (not counting consensus votes and such). 

By the way, I’ll point out that monolithic blockchains are struggling to keep up even with this tiny, tiny level of activity. [Rollups & specialized DA layers like data shards](https://polynya.medium.com/why-rollups-data-shards-are-the-only-sustainable-solution-for-high-scalability-c9aabd6fbb48) are inevitable. Since I wrote that post, Polygon PoS has bumped their gas floor 30x, Solana has occasional instability (usually short-lived, but up to 18 hours downtime), Binance Smart Chain is in meltdown, Avalanche C-chain gas prices tend to skyrocket when blocks are full etc. All of these projects have seen any real activity for only a few months, there's zero chance they can sustain over decades. The evidence is mounting, at this point I have zero doubts about the rollups, volitions, data shards & DA layers being pervasive throughout the blockchain industry. Sorry, you know I had to mention it! 

Anyway, back to rollups. Even if we saturate 5,000 TPS, further, we have StarkNet & zkSync 2.0 releasing volition systems in early 2022 with alternative DA solutions, which are much, much easier to parallelize and scale than stateful blockchains. Not as secure as rollups, to be sure, but still more so than centralized L1s. So, we have plenty of throughput left to exploit. By the way, here’s a nice site to follow along where [Ethereum sidechains & rollups activity is at](https://ethtps.info/). 

**The long-term solution remains data sharding**, of course. That’ll get us 10,000x scale [incrementally over the next 4 years](https://twitter.com/drakefjustin/status/1462365131761983494), and [speculatively 1 million x over the decade](https://twitter.com/epolynya/status/1462384086614298624). In the short-term, though, this EIP will be a huge boon that’ll have an outsized impact in bootstrapping adoption for rollups. When data sharding does release, rollups will be ready. 

I hope you will all join me in supporting this EIP! If you have any questions & concerns, please do post them here.

How does ethereum keep the size of the blockchain manageable after the merge?,"One of the challenges of decentralization is keeping the size of the blockchain small so that nodes are not too expensive to run. This is why we don’t just keep increasing the block size.

Eth 2.0 is supposed to increase the scale of ethereum by using a different consensus mechanism, which allows blocks to be added much more quickly, but how does the network not suffer from having a blockchain that explodes in size, requiring nodes to use more storage, and thus causing node centralization? How is moving to proof of stake any different from just increasing the block size in that respect?",31.0,2021-11-23 07:37:51,0.94
Impromptu technical AMA on history expiry,"Currently, one of the biggest bottlenecks in scaling the Ethereum L1 is hard disk storage. Even at current gas limits, the chain is only a few years away from being too large for many people's hard drives (including my own) to store. [Statelessness through Verkle trees](https://notes.ethereum.org/Yn_mwNa2SeeQHnKsRgekKg), and potentially [state expiry](https://notes.ethereum.org/@vbuterin/state_expiry_eip), allow validators and nodes to run either without storing any state or at least storing an amount of state that stays constant instead of growing over time.

**History expiry** is the idea of doing the same with blockchain history: instead of all full nodes having to download and serve the full chain from genesis, and needing to have ever-increasing technical complexity to deal with both old and new versions, the core Ethereum protocol would only be responsible for holding and serving the most recent ~1 year of historical blocks, transactions and receipts/logs. **This can reduce code complexity and reduce storage requirements for nodes, paving the way for more decentralization.**

**Older blocks, transactions and receipts/logs would still be accessible through dedicated sub-protocols** (eg. [the Portal Network](https://github.com/ethereum/portal-network-specs)) or externally developed protocols (eg. [TheGraph](https://thegraph.com/en/)), in addition to a much smaller but still sufficient number of volunteer nodes and block explorers. Note that many dapps are already moving their historical data queries to TheGraph and similar protocols for efficiency.

There are two realistically implementable history expiry proposals (which are not mutually exclusive; we can do both):

* **One-time expiry of pre-merge history**: a few months to a year after the merge, Ethereum nodes stop downloading or serving the pre-merge PoW chain
* **Regular rolling expiry (EIP 4444)**: see [the EIP 4444 documentation](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4444), and [Matt's Twitter thread](https://twitter.com/lightclients/status/1462576116359569411) explaining the importance of doing something like it.

The EIP 4444 authors and myself are happy to answer any questions on history expiry, what the benefits are, and how existing users and applications that depend on older history can adapt.",458.0,2021-11-22 21:04:09,0.98

**Frequently Asked Questions**

**Where's the best place to buy ETH?**

There are many centralized exchanges that support Ethereum. If you live in the US, the most popular exchanges are Coinbase, Gemeni and Kraken. Coinbase users can use Coinbase Pro for lower fees.

**When is Eth2 launching?**

Eth2 is a marketing term used to represent a number of updates to Ethereum. The Eth2 proof-of-stake chain first launched in December 2020. ""The Merge"", which is the event that will fully switch Ethereum's consensus to proof-of-stake, is estimated to be ready in early 2022, although there is no exact timeline. Other updates, such as data shards, will follow that update.

Visit [ethmerge.com](https://ethmerge.com/) to learn more about ""The Merge"".

**Do I need to do anything to update to Eth2? Will Eth2 create a new token?**

No, ETH holders *never* need to take any action to keep holding ETH. Ethereum users will be unaffected by the Eth2 upgrade. And the Eth2 updates will not create any new tokens.

**How can I stake my ETH?**

There are two ways that you can stake your ETH: by running your own validator, or providing your ETH to a staking pool.

* Running your own validator requires a modern computer and 32 ETH. Visit /r/ethstaker for more details
* Staking pools accept any amount of ETH. We recommend [Lido](https://lido.fi/) or [StakeWise](https://stakewise.io/)

**Why are Ethereum transaction fees so high?**

Like most blockchains, Ethereum fees are determined by supply-and-demand. The large demand to use Ethereum has pushed transaction fees quite high (however, fees were just a few cents only 2 years ago). Fees are especially high during market volatility, and during NFT drops.

**What is being done to lower Ethereum transaction fees?**

Ethereum fees are reduced by using layer-2 rollups. Rollups are scaling solutions that allow for significantly cheaper transactions, while still maintaining Ethereum's security.

Additionally, Eth2's data shards will make rollups even cheaper.

While rollups are cutting-edge technology being actively developed, a number are already live on Ethereum mainnet. Visit [l2beat.com](https://l2beat.com/) to learn more about rollups.

**What's the best wallet for Ethereum?**

The most popular tool for using decentralized applications is Metamask. However, for security reasons, we recommend using a hardware wallet such as a Trezor or Ledger.

"The Ethereum One Lane Highway, and how loopring fits into the Picture","# Preface

ALRIGHT APES LISTEN UP, IF YOU WANT TO CHANGE THE WORLD THIS IS HOW WE DO IT. THE POST MAY BE DENSE BUT IT'S WORTH IT.

(my poor attempt to memeify this cause I'm not a typical ape, just a nerd lol)

I made this post over on Ethereum and was going to cross post here, but it wouldn't let me.  So I wanted to share it with all of the Apes who are new to the Ethereum space so I could help everyone understand how Loopring and other Layer 2 protocols can improve our system we call Ethereum.  This post is not motivated by a desire to pump the price, but a desire to change the world, and we change the world by sharing knowledge with each other.  If you're not sure how Ethereum is going to change the world, then I'm not sure why you're investing in loopring and I encourage you to do some more research. But if you do understand how Ethereum can change the world but don't understand how Loopring fits into the equation,  we have to start by understanding the current problems with Ethereum and how we can fix them.  I now present, The One Lane Ethereum Highway metaphor.

# The One Lane Ethereum Highway

I've seen a lot of users talk recently about gas fees that are ridiculously expensive and keeping them out of Defi and all the other Dapps that exist in the ethereum ecosystem. Let me just start by saying, I understand and feel your pain. I've been in the space since 2017 and had tons of time to play and experiment with smart contracts when they were new and cheap, including some of the first DEXs like etherDelta/forkDelta. When I was using those primitive smart contract systems or claiming my first Gods Unchained cards, the future that we currently live in with hundreds of thousands of people trying to use ethereum seemed at least 10 years away. But here we are now 3-5 years later, and tons of people are trying to use Ethereum which is great, but gas fees are not.

I think it's important to mention this stuff because in this metaphor I'm about to use Ethereum is sort of like a highway system. A highway system that is really really popular and has has tons of cities (dapps) springing up around it! This is what is causing the problem with our current gas fees and prices.

If we continue with this sort of metaphor in explaining the gas fees, you could imagine that Ethereum is actually only a one lane highway, that allows 12-15 cars at a time, built on top of infrastructure that needs to be updated. We cannot go fast or reliably get everyone to where they want to go unless we update this infrastructure, expand the amount of lanes, allow more cars onto the highway, and then build a carpooling system that allows everyone to split the gas.

Lucky for us these things are all being done right now! It's just going to take time. To go a little deeper, let me continue on with this metaphor so that we can talk about each piece inside of the system.

# Infrastructure

The low level infrastructure that holds up the highway is our consensus tool that we use, Proof of Work. The builders know that in the long run, we can finding a better stronger system that has a lower point of entry and is energy efficient by implementing Proof of Stake. This is currently being worked on now and is ultra delicate because our consensus it's what holds up the entire network currently. Since people are using the highway right now, if our consensus fails, everything goes to zero. Or in the language of the metaphor, the highway falls and the cities stop working.

# Lanes

Once the infrastructure has been built, the next thing to do is expand the number of lanes. In Ethereum that means sharding. Each lane (shard) on Ethereum is essentially a new blockchain, and each of these lanes is built on top of the Proof of Stake infrastructure (this coordinates all lanes to make sure they're going the same direction). The current plan last time I checked is to add 1024 lanes (shards) that are all capable of 10-15 cars (transactions) per second. If you do the math, in this new multi-lane highway, we're now going from a capacity of 10 to 15 cars (transactions) per second to a capacity of somewhere between 10,000 and 15,000 cars per second.

# Capacity Problem

Wowzers! We just multiplied our transactional capacity by an insane amount! This is great, but now we have another problem, each of the cars (transactions) per lane on the highway can only facilitate one person at a time. This might be okay for a small town or city, but **we're trying to build the highway for the world people**! If everyone is trying to hop in a car to get where they're going, demand is going to soar and gas/rider prices are going to go up! That is bad. It is currently what's happening in our singular chain system and will also happen in a sharded system when enough people enter the space.

# Carpooling

We fix this and improve the capcity of each car (transactions) by carpooling. In Ethereum, this means layer 2 (optimistic rollups/zkRollups). Essentially a zkRollup batches together a lot of riders (users and their transactions) so that they can hop in the car together and split the gas cost. These systems don't only allow 2-3 persons per car though. They provide thousands of seats per car (optimistic rollups), and the really fancy ones provide tens of thousands of seats (zkRollups). While each car (transaction) in the lanes may still be paying a high gas/rider fee, the cost is split proportionally by all the riders in the car. So hypothetically if one car pays a gas fee of $150 for using the lane, when it's split by by 10k riders per car, we're looking at a .01c cost per rider and this cost goes down as more people carpool. My numbers may be slightly off here on the transactional scaling capacity, but this is the general idea. There's a lot more nuance to how optimistic/zkRollups batch transactions, but from my understanding and looking at the chart from [Vitaliks post on Rollups](https://vitalik.ca/general/2021/01/05/rollup.html) **he mentions a max scalability gain of x570 per batch at peak performance.**

\-Note, the max scalability gains here is exactly what Loopring is working on.

# Overview and our ability to carpool now!

Today, we have the One Lane Ethereum Highway with thousands of users trying to fight over who gets to ride in the car. We have a long way to go if we want to build the Ethereum super highway, but the good news is that right now, some people are already carpooling via platforms like **Optimism, Arbitrum, Loopring** etc. Even though the carpool system (layer2) is not yet easy and seamless now we can to teach people how to use it as we slowly make it more intuitive/easy. With the proper systems, carpooling (layer2) will be the standard. With these temporary gains upfront via layer 2, we can ease the passenger burden temporarily until we manage to overhaul the main infrastructure. Once all of the infrastructure has been built, everyone will already know how to carpool, and we begin our life on the Ethereum superhighway and change the world.

# Conclusion

Life right now on the One Lane Ethereum Highway is hard. But the future is bright, and the important thing is that people want to use the highway! I think its easy to get caught up on the gas fees and look for short term solutions with other chains, but the process of building the Super Highway is slow because it is delicate (due to the value it secures) and because it is being built in a decentralized fashion. **This is a collective effort, not a centralized effort**. We have all sorts of [teams](https://eth.wiki/eth2/clients) grinding away day after day to build the proof of stake infrastructure system. Once they finish there, they're going to start on expanding the number of lanes. Simultaneously, we have teams working tirelessly on the carpooling solution, like [Optimism](https://www.optimism.io/), [Arbitrum](https://offchainlabs.com/), and [Loopring](https://loopring.org/#/).

**We** ***will*** **get there, but it will take time**. If we want Ethereum to change the world and bring equality and power to the people, it needs to be done right, not fast. Fast is the enemy of a good product. 3-5 years for these scaling solutions may seem a long way away, but that's what I thought in 2018 in regards to the onboarding of users. Before you know it, Layer 2 will be here. Then Proof of Stake will be here, then Sharding will be here. Once those things happen, the Web2 world as we know it of centralized communities, finance, potentially governance will collapse and give way to a more democratic, emergent and egalitarian system.

Our ability to coordinate using DAOs, and decentralized consensus could be the tool that in my mind unlocks the true cooperative potential of the human race. No longer will we be bound by Governing and Corporate structures. We will live in a highly emergent society with overlapping communities that self govern and build. Data can be recaptured and monetized by the users that generate it. A constantly evolving society that incentivizes collective action and positive growth is something that I believe grows from true and decentralized society. That is how we change the world.

# Final Thoughts

With our charge into the future of Web3, it is important to think about and discuss about how we can build a better world for all of us. Discussion and education is critical to onboarding the mass of users and convincing them that the world could be better with a system like Ethereum. That is my goal here. I may not be right on all of the technicalities of building the Ethereum Super Highway , but from my understanding, this is what it looks like. That being said, if anyone wants to chip in their thoughts on where this metaphor might be incorrect, please let me know and I can update this post.

For all other laymans, *ask questions, get involved, try new systems*, *especially Layer 2 solutions!* We are only as strong as our collective ability to discuss these problems, and address them. I believe we have that capability and Ethereum will only enable us to strengthen that collective trait.

# The One Lane Ethereum Highway

I've seen a lot of users talk recently about gas fees that are ridiculously expensive and keeping them out of Defi and all the other Dapps that exist in the ethereum ecosystem. Let me just start by saying, I understand and feel your pain.  I've been in the space since 2017 and had tons of time to play and experiment with smart contracts when they were new and cheap, including some of the first DEXs like etherDelta/forkDelta.  When I was using those primitive smart contract systems or claiming my first Gods Unchained cards, the future that we currently live in with hundreds of thousands of people trying to use ethereum seemed at least 10 years away.  But here we are now 3-5 years later, and tons of people are trying to use Ethereum which is great,  but gas fees are not.

I think it's important to mention this stuff because in this metaphor I'm about to use Ethereum is sort of like a highway system.  A highway system that is really really popular and has has tons of cities (dapps) springing up around it!  This is what is causing the problem with our current gas fees and prices.

If we continue with this sort of metaphor in explaining the gas fees, you could imagine that Ethereum is actually only a one lane highway, that allows 12-15 cars at a time, built on top of infrastructure that needs to be updated.  We cannot go fast or reliably get everyone to where they want to go unless we update this infrastructure, expand the amount of lanes, allow more cars onto the highway, and then build a carpooling system that allows everyone to split the gas.

Lucky for us these things are all being done right now!  It's just going to take time.  To go a little deeper, let me continue on with this metaphor so that we can talk about each piece inside of the system.

# Infrastructure

The low level infrastructure that holds up the highway is our consensus tool that we use, Proof of Work.  The builders know that in the long run, we can finding a better stronger system that has a lower point of entry and is energy efficient by implementing Proof of Stake.  This is currently being worked on now and is ultra delicate because our consensus it's what holds up the entire network currently. Since people are using the highway right now, if our consensus fails, everything goes to zero.  Or in the language of the metaphor, the highway falls and the cities stop working.

# Lanes

Once the infrastructure has been built, the next thing to do is expand the number of lanes.  In Ethereum that means sharding.  Each lane (shard) on Ethereum is essentially a new blockchain, and each of these lanes is built on top of the Proof of Stake infrastructure (this coordinates all lanes to make sure they're going the same direction).  The current plan last time I checked is to add 1024 lanes (shards) that are all capable of 10-15 cars (transactions) per second. If you do the math, in this new multi-lane highway, we're now going from a capacity of 10 to 15 cars (transactions) per second to a capacity of somewhere between 10,000 and 15,000 cars per second.

# Capacity Problem

Wowzers! We just multiplied our transactional capacity by an insane amount!  This is great, but now we have another problem, each of the cars (transactions) per lane on the highway can only facilitate one person at a time.  This might be okay for a small town or city, but **we're trying to build the highway for the world people**!  If everyone is trying to hop in a car to get where they're going, demand is going to soar and gas/rider prices are going to go up!  That is bad.  It is currently what's happening in our singular chain system and will also happen in a sharded system when enough people enter the space.

# Carpooling

We fix this and improve the capcity of each car (transactions) by carpooling.  In Ethereum, this means layer 2 (optimistic rollups/zkRollups).  Essentially a zkRollup batches together a lot of riders (users and their transactions) so that they can hop in the car together and split the gas cost.  These systems don't only allow 2-3 persons per car though. They provide thousands of seats per car (optimistic rollups), and the really fancy ones provide tens of thousands of seats (zkRollups).  While each car (transaction) in the lanes may still be paying a high gas/rider fee, the cost is split proportionally by all the riders in the car. So hypothetically if one car pays a gas fee of $150 for using the lane, when it's split by by 10k riders per car, we're looking at a .01c cost per rider and this cost goes down as more people carpool.  My numbers may be slightly off here on the transactional scaling capacity, but this is the general idea.  There's a lot more nuance to how optimistic/zkRollups batch transactions, but from my understanding and looking at the chart from [Vitaliks post on Rollups](https://vitalik.ca/general/2021/01/05/rollup.html) he mentions a max scalability gain of x570 per batch at peak performance.

Edit - I think its important to clarify, that Layer 1 as an expensive layer for transacting will always be the case.  This expense is what promises the security of the network.

"""It Takes Money To Buy Whiskey"" - Ryan Cohen","\*\*I tried posting this last week but it got mod blocked for some reason\*\* Trying again. Thought it would be a good time with all the option drama. Morale of the post is the NFT market place will reach far beyond gaming. The gaming marketcap is not what RC has his eyes on. He is looking to take away the middle man in nearly every industry allowing indie people to actually make money on their value. Imagine a talented musician able to crowd source money for creation of an album by offering 50% of the final product as an NFT. The people holding the NFTs do not mind because they know the NFT goes up if album is good and the artist then takes home 50% profit instead of a 10% profit they would have gotten from an agency.\*\*

# It takes money to buy whiskey

So, the below article goes into details regarding an NFT fund that is used to buy stakes in whiskey producing. The NFT’s are backed by actual whiskey. So as the whiskey ages the NFT’s gains value.

Before we dig into the meat and potatoes of this let’s get the tits jacked. See below piece. Notice anything????

You NEED MONEY TO BUY THE WHISKEY NFT. I think he was leading us to this article to help us understand what the hell GameStop will be doing, and it is freaking amazing and genius and every other good word that is in the dictionary.

[https://www.insidehook.com/article/booze/blockbar-nft-crypto-spirits-wine-marketplace](https://www.insidehook.com/article/booze/blockbar-nft-crypto-spirits-wine-marketplace)

# Why the hell would I want to invest in a whiskey NFT?

Tokenized whiskey? WTF is going on here? Well you see the whiskey starts off at 750-900$ per barrel then it can double, triple, quadruple, ect.. as time go by. So a group buys into the NFT to make the barrel and as time goes on the whiskey appreciates in value and so does your NFT. You can sell your stake in the whiskey process midway and double your money. The next person can sit on it for a few months and make gains as well.

So he is trying to tell you that you can do the same thing. To easily understand this, you can invest in an NFT game with a group of investors. Let’s say you and a group of other investors raise $100,000 for the project and you believe the game will be a huge success so you hold onto to your NFT while the game is being produced. Well at any time in production you can sell your stake in the game for a profit. The game will age just like whiskey. If it’s from a good producer, it will be a great investment.

Well, what does GameStop bring to the table in this regard? They will be the marketplace for game developers to sell their NFTs so they can work independently with crowdsourced money. As the whiskey article explains, the NFT allows the asset to be more liquid which brings in more investors. You may not want to invest in an NFT project if it may be hard to sell out at anytime due to limited buyers but with GameStop’s NFT marketplace you will be able to trade your stakes in these NFTs at anytime through this interconnected hub with millions of other investors or collectors. The liquidity is what will drive in investors in droves knowing it’s easy to backout if you don’t think it is going anywhere and it will be easy for investors who think the project will be going to the stars to buy in from someone with a more bearish opinion then them. This will be a place where diamond hands thrive.

# Flappy Bird (forgot this in orginal post)

Remember the game Flappy Bird? That game was a huge success and made by one developer. It was making 50 grand a day with advertisements alone. So, imagine investing in some random developer to make a game. You and ten other investors invest a grand and receive an NFT as your token of ownership of the game. The game developer owns a portion of the NFTs and GameStop owns some portions of the NFTs. This game then becomes a huge success like flappy bird. You may have just turned your 1000$ into a million dollars. And the brilliant game developer that no one recognizes gets to walk away with bank due to crowd sourcing. He would have never gotten the chance if it wasn’t for you.

# Music

Let’s take this to another layer. Say a musician wants to create an album but needs funding to do so. Instead of signing a crappy ass record label and getting screwed in the long run, they can sell a piece of their ownership of the final product to the marketplace crowd. The music creator says I need 50K to get this album out the door. I will give 50% ownership of this album to whoever pays me 50 grand. Multiple investors can chip away at this piece of the pie. GameStop will be the mediator that allows investor to meet creator and take a small gain to keep the market place growing.

# Art, Film, Clothes Designing, New Ideas, ect…

So you see where this is going? This is much bigger than games. If they secure a marketplace that is fluent and attracts a lot of people, brilliant minds will stop going to companies that f\*ck them for money but will negotiate with everyday people for fund sourcing for their dreams. They will not have to please their bosses but would rather please their fans and be able to be createlike never before. AKA power to the creators. And the beauty of an NFT is that they can remain completely anonymous while they do this. GAME ON ANON.

# GameStop Merger

GameStop has been posting bullish job postings with M&A requirements (merger and acquisitions), ERP transitions, carve outs, ect… Some People were speculating a spin off by I don’t agree.

See below the two job postings I found real quick from searching.

https://preview.redd.it/aaj83jqyc2081.png?width=812&format=png&auto=webp&s=fd90bca039ab5f2dcbcc755ad1b337779394a3ad

One shows a system carve out which some pointed out to as being a split off aka GameStop NFT splitting off and becoming it’s own company but I don’t think this is the case. Remember guys Power to the players is GameStop. Their NFT website says Power to the creators, Power to the players and Power to the collectors. This absolutely leads me to believe that they are not splitting off. The below snip is from [https://www.gambit.de/en/carve-out-en/](https://www.gambit.de/en/carve-out-en/). It explains how a system carve out is also needed in a merger.

https://preview.redd.it/441h1kh6d2081.png?width=887&format=png&auto=webp&s=57903faf8c3e0f9a2dc8ce0ca39deface282458a

# What do both job postings listed above have in common? Merger and acquisition.

I work for a business that recently did a merger and I can give our timeline to estimate a GME merger timeline. Employees were informed of the merger in March of 2020. The CEO of the company we merged with talked with us and talked about the merger process. He had been knowing about the merger since the summer before. So, there was ongoing negotiations for 3-9 months prior to the announcement.

We know GME hired Matt Finestone in early Summer so if there was negotiations with Loopring, they would be well underway. I’m not saying Loopring is the absolute choice but I know it’s who I would pick.

Gme merging with LoopRing would benefit both GameStop and Loopring. GameStop has the loyal supporters and large customer base. Loopring has the intellectual property which would prevent anyone from copying GameStop’s system. Both together would dominate the future. GameStop is ahead of where everything is going and Loopring has the key to lock up the market for years.

Back to the merger. Following the announcement, the shareholders would have to vote on yay or nay on the merger.

Once shareholders vote yes on the merger, the companies would then set a date on when the merger will be official. The value of both companies will be combined, and there will be a new price per share. It’s possible there could be share splits or reverse splits for GameStop owners. GameStop could also elect to change the name of the company if they would like.

So once they announce the merger, there is a period of time before the merger actually happens. People will be flocking to GME stock left and right to be part of the future. Buy what you can now if you like the company. We may never see 200$ or even 300$ again after the announcement.

# TLDR: POWER TO THE PLAYERS, POWER TO THE CREATORS, POWER TO THE COLLECTORS

This is the most genius slogan I can think of. GME is about to literally change the way shit works. Say goodbye to the mainstream. They are putting the power into the people rather than the big shitty corporations.

They will connect everyone, and this slogan says it all. Think about it. How do you cater to different players of games? Some people want a sports game but would also maybe like to have guns and sharks with laser beams in it. Well maybe they pitch the idea in GameStop’s marketplace. A creator comes in and says if the players can raise “x” amount of capital, they will create it for them. The collectors see this and think wow let me get a piece of that because that may be valuable one day. The creator makes it; the players and collectors pay for it and the game ages like fine whiskey. It takes money to buy whiskey!!!!! The below link is to an article explaining how investors can buy an NFT of whiskey and watch it appreciate over time. The whiskey is backed by actual aging whiskey like how GME NFT will be backed by actual projects such as games, music, art, new ideas ect…The article also explains how investors have to put up a lot of money for the project but can be rewarded up to five times they paid in a couple years.

[https://www.insidehook.com/article/booze/whiskey-fund-tokenize](https://www.insidehook.com/article/booze/whiskey-fund-tokenize)

This extends to art, music, movies, whiskey, etc… The NFT aspect attracts all investors since it is easy to buy and sell or aka have liquidity. GameStop works with LoopRing and gains exclusive access to their patents which makes Ethereum usable in a marketplace and also eliminates front running which attracts every day investors since they know they will not be fx'd over. Talented game developers work independently with maybe other creators and can make maximum profit rather than shitty CEO’s and executives taking the money. They are more motivated which equates to better games.

**PS:** I believe Gamestop will merge with LoopRing. I think the contract is underway and that will be the first thing that will be announced. I’ve just been through a merger, and I can feel it in my balls that GME and LoopRing are currently negotiating. It takes a lot of planning for a merger but they usually announce it months before it actually happens. Negotiate for 3-6 months then announce the merger. The actual merger can take up to another 6 months to actually take place. People will be buying GME shares like crazy to be a part of the new company forming before it happens.

With that I will say we do not need to worry about a catalyst to force shorts to cover because GME business transformation is the actual golden ticket. I’m not going to speak for you but I would respect GameStop much more for spending their money and time wisely creating the new frontier that will dominate the global market rather than an NFT that will not secure their future. Other companies are building metaverses such as Facebook. To you Ryan Cohen and GME personnel, do what you gotta do to beat the competition.

GME at a 2 trillion market cap would make you 200 times the amount of money you are seeing in your portfolio. The MOASS will happen along the way but also know that GameStop doesn't need shorts to bring it to the moon because they are doing it behind the scenes without the fuckup that shorters created.

**Where's the best place to buy ETH?**

There are many centralized exchanges that support Ethereum. If you live in the US, the most popular exchanges are Coinbase, Gemeni and Kraken. Coinbase users can use Coinbase Pro for lower fees.

**When is Eth2 launching?**

Eth2 is a marketing term used to represent a number of updates to Ethereum. The Eth2 proof-of-stake chain first launched in December 2020. ""The Merge"", which is the event that will fully switch Ethereum's consensus to proof-of-stake, is estimated to be ready in early 2022, although there is no exact timeline. Other updates, such as data shards, will follow that update.

Visit [ethmerge.com](https://ethmerge.com/) to learn more about ""The Merge"".

**Do I need to do anything to update to Eth2? Will Eth2 create a new token?**

No, ETH holders *never* need to take any action to keep holding ETH. Ethereum users will be unaffected by the Eth2 upgrade. And the Eth2 updates will not create any new tokens.

**How can I stake my ETH?**

There are two ways that you can stake your ETH: by running your own validator, or providing your ETH to a staking pool.

* Running your own validator requires a modern computer and 32 ETH. Visit /r/ethstaker for more details
* Staking pools accept any amount of ETH. We recommend [Lido](https://lido.fi/) or [StakeWise](https://stakewise.io/)

**Why are Ethereum transaction fees so high?**

Like most blockchains, Ethereum fees are determined by supply-and-demand. The large demand to use Ethereum has pushed transaction fees quite high (however, fees were just a few cents only 2 years ago). Fees are especially high during market volatility, and during NFT drops.

**What is being done to lower Ethereum transaction fees?**

Ethereum fees are reduced by using layer-2 rollups. Rollups are scaling solutions that allow for significantly cheaper transactions, while still maintaining Ethereum's security.

Additionally, Eth2's data shards will make rollups even cheaper.

While rollups are cutting-edge technology being actively developed, a number are already live on Ethereum mainnet. Visit [l2beat.com](https://l2beat.com/) to learn more about rollups.

**What's the best wallet for Ethereum?**

The most popular tool for using decentralized applications is Metamask. However, for security reasons, we recommend using a hardware wallet such as a Trezor or Ledger.

watchtheburn.com has a new Insights Page,"[watchtheburn.com](https://watchtheburn.com) has a new Insights Page. The base fee graph buckets per period (1h/1d/1m) the min/max/median/90th percentile, so it can help you make decisions whether to submit that transaction. As usual, this is all free and open source (from the UX to the Daemon to the Data)!

Interesting trends:

* base fee is increasing month after month, which means, Ethereum is active users is increasing record numbers
* We are almost coming to a negative issuance of ethers per whole month. Ultra sound
* You can easily see which days have the most tips, once the merge to PoS happens, this will all go to the proposers!

ETH Supply (discussion requested),"Apparently r/ethereum isn't very active and can't post to r/CryptoCurrency

I am surprised there is not more discussion about the coming ETH supply shock post merge.

I'm  not sure what the short term implications on ETH price and gas fees are  going to be. But long term, the issuance will have to equal average  burn rate; as there is not an infinite supply to keep burning.

The  estimated ETH issuance will be around 1,600/day. Currently we are  burning around 10k ETH a day (current issuance 14-15k). With the current  ETH burn structure from EIP-1559, burning 1,600 ETH/day would require  an average base fee of 16.......with half full blocks that is only  606,000 transactions per day.

Using  the current network demand of $60,000,000 in fees per day; for 600k  transactions to produce $60 million in fees, the ETH price would be  $37,500 with an average transaction cost of $99.00.

&#x200B;

EDIT:

Once ""ETH burn"" == ""ETH issuance"" (\~1,600 a day), the price of ETH will need to increase by $625.00USD/ETH for every $1,000,000 USD network demand.   If layer 2's are willing to spend $100 million USD for block space, the price would need to be $62,500 per ETH.

&#x200B;

EDIT 2: 

Issuance rate can be adjusted by increasing the amount of ETH staked (also, I think sharding will also increase the issuance independent of ETH staked, but not 100% sure)",67.0,2021-11-09 15:14:39,0.97
Crypto haters will cause ETH prices to explode within the next 6 months,"I'm sure many of you, like me, live and breathe crypto during most of their waking hours. I'm living in a bubble where basically everyone is into crypto, so I was amazed at the amount of negative reactions on Twitter/Reddit at Discord announcing an Ethereum login feature (and possibly using your NFTs as a profile pic). 

It's just a feature, no one is forced to use it, but a lot of people where very vocally opposed to it, even saying that they would cancel their subscription and encourage their friends/communities to move to a different platform. Apparently there is quite a large group of (young) people who are deeply opposed to crypto. 

Their arguments where basically:
- Bad for the environment (most important reason)
- It's just hype no real value 
- Bad for artists (NFTs empower artists so I don't get this one) 

Here is the alpha. Their main argument (bad for environment) will completely evaporate within the next 6 months. Sure most of them won't immediately become pro crypto, but there will be a large group who were on the fence, but who were swayed by all the hate, that will. 

More importantly there will be a ton of companies who will start using Ethereum. Think of all the big brands that would love NFTs but don't dare to burn their fingers on the environmental concerns. They will all jump in. 

The ""hype no value"" argument will be destroyed by all these big brands legitimizing the space and the ""bad for artists"" argument will disappear as people get more educated on the subject.

My guess is that we will see increasing ETH prices as investors and funds try to frontrun the merge. Then a misguided ""sell the news"" event directly after the merge, followed by a true boom as new people and companies pile in and we hit true mainstream. Let's go!",39.0,2021-11-09 10:33:39,0.83

Ethereum PoS Merge Countdown,"Hi all,

I have spent some time creating a website that shows a countdown to the Ethereum Mainnet merge with the PoS upgrade. I wasn't able to find anything like that so I made a one. Currently the website counts down towards 1st of June 2022 which is the speculative merge date, however, I am able to amend this on the fly. Don't take this literally!

There are four sections to the website- main page with the countdown and a subscription box to get notified when the merge happens (done via MailChimp), about page, ticker symbol and a source where I do posts/updates. I might do some improvements to the timer so it displays better on mobile and so on but in the meantime it is what it is. If you have any suggestions, I am open to them.

The long term bull case for ETH - Part 2: The flippening," (“Part 1: The Merge” is a must read to understand the effects of the Merge and understanding why the flippening has a high chance of happening once the Merge is live. I won’t explain in detail some concepts already covered in part 1 | [Link to Part 1](https://techmaxi.medium.com/the-long-term-bull-case-for-eth-part-1-the-merge-understanding-the-change-in-market-dynamics-b6e8c51315a7) )

&#x200B;

The flippening is the most hyped event in the history of blockchains, the moment in which ETH becomes the top crypto by marketcap, taking Bitcoin’s spot. It was close to happening in 2017, and every time ETH has a big run on the ETH/BTC pair (also called the ratio) all the ETH holders get excited about it and the drums of the flippening can be heard across the internet, only to fall short as the ratio goes down and the flippening fails.

There’s a sentence which gets repeated every time the ratio makes a big run: this time is different. Is this time different and will the flippening finally happen? 

To answer this question we need to analyze the main reasons which explain why the flippening was very hard to achieve and the “solutions” that have been slowly coming online. The Merge will be the final stone to allow a successful flippening, solving multiple of these issues at the same time.

There are four main reasons which are holding the flippening back:

1. High sell pressure

2. Lack of fee capture

3. Not enough scale

4. Insufficient demand

&#x200B;

1.High sell pressure

Under PoW the Ethereum network has been massively overpaying for security by having a high ETH issuance, it’s overpaying by a factor of x10 compared to the issuance there will be under PoS. Having a high issuance is the same as having a high sell pressure which causes the ratio to go down, as miners must sell most of the ETH gained to cover costs. To compare it with BTC, ETH has a far higher security budget (including into the calculation priority fees and MEV) than BTC while having less than half of its market cap. 

The problem of an excessive sell pressure is being fixed by two big changes; the first change has been EIP 1559 which went live in August. What EIP 1559 does is burning most of the gas fees (the base fee gets burned while the priority fee still goes to miners), instead of the full fees going to miners, which reduces the sell pressure. Since EIP 1559 went live, around 80% of total fees get burned.

The Merge is the second big change which will heavily reduce sell pressure, expected to go live around Q2 2022. Once live, the issuance of new ETH will be reduced by 90%. Additionally the issuance won’t go to miners anymore, under PoS the issuance will go to validators, which are less likely to sell the ETH gained as validators have much lower costs compared to miners.

A similar network usage as we have been seeing since EIP 1559 went live combined with PoS will make ETH be deflationary.

A massive reduction of the sell pressure through EIP 1559 and the Merge will make the ratio go up as long as demand remains the same.

&#x200B;

2. Lack of fee capture

Until very recently the Ethereum network didn’t benefit from increased usage, all the fees paid to make transactions or interact with smart contracts would go to miners which would be mostly sold. ETH holders didn’t benefit directly from network usage, only miners did.

EIP 1559 changes this, now that most of the fees are burned, the value of those fees burned go to ETH holders, it acts as a buy back mechanism.

To visualize this buy back mechanism lets imagine ETH has a supply of 100 ETH, each of them with a value of $1, the market cap would be $100. We now imagine that in 1 year ten of those ETH get burned due to a high usage of the network, there’s now 90 ETH, but the market cap is still $100, the tokens get burned but the value doesn’t. The value goes to ETH holders, now one ETH is worth around $1.11 instead of the $1 it was worth at the beginning, every token holder has benefited from the high usage of the network and has gained around 11%.

As of now ETH is set to burn more than $10b in fees annually, all of it going to token holders. In the future as ETH scales with L2s and data shards, more and more fees will be burned, making ETH more and more valuable. EIP 1559 acts as buying pressure which will push the ratio up.

&#x200B;

3. Not enough scale

Historically runs on the ratio have happened during bull markets. The fees start low as we leave the bear market but quickly go up as prices and speculation ramps up. Users start to discover all the things that can be done on the ETH network, only to be hit with high gas fees due to a lack of scale. Most users end up being priced out from using the network and end up moving to other L1s which can offer more scale and low fees by disregarding decentralization and security. A big number of these users not only will leave the network, but they will also sell their ETH and instead buy the token of the network they moved to. 

While block space has been going up these last years, the demand has increased exponentially. However in recent months layer 2 solutions (L2s) have started to come online, which is one of the two “technologies” ETH will use to scale. A layer 2 solution allows execution to be done off chain, L2s post a proof to the layer 1 (by doing so the L2 is as secure as the L1 it posts the proof to) of the transactions that were made. By doing this a L2 can scale orders of magnitudes higher than L1 and have much lower fees. ETH on layer 1 can do around 15 transactions per second (TPS) while a layer 2 can do up to 1000 TPS. Optimism and Arbitrum are L2s which have gone live in recent months and are slowly scaling their systems to reach 100s of TPS and eventually up to a 1000 TPS. In the next months more and more L2s are expected to go live, such as zkSync and StarkNet, and many more will be coming online in the next years. Some of these L2 solutions will combine a zk-rollup posting proofs to the L1 with the possibility of using off-chain data (this kind of hybrid solution is called a volition). Volitions are much more scalable (by sacrificing some security when using off-chain data) and will be able to offer 1000s of TPS before data shards are live.

In the future L2 solutions will be combined with data shards, which will provide a big amount of block space to post transaction proofs. A single L2 using data shards will be able to scale to tens of thousands of transactions per second, and the full scale of all L2s combined using data shards will be in the millions of TPS by the end of the decade.

L2s being able to offer low fees with the security of ETH is very important as most of the users don’t have enough capital to be able to afford transactions on the layer 1. These users will now be able to use ETH “directly” and won’t need to move to other networks. With a bigger amount of users ETH can support, more of them will invest into ETH to use as a collateral into DeFi, to yield farm, to stake or just to hold as an investment. It’s also important to note that all these L2s pay transaction fees to be able to post the proofs on the layer 1, these fees are burned, going to token holders through EIP 1559, adding more upward pressure on the ratio.

&#x200B;

4. Insufficient demand

DeFi and NFTs are very young, before 2020 the ETH network was mostly empty, ETH demand was fundamentally very low. We saw very high demand for ETH in 2017 to invest into ICOs but after that not much could be done with it except buying and holding waiting for the price to go up. 

Nowadays this couldn’t be further from the truth, ETH allows you to participate in 100s of different dapps such as Compound and Aave which allow you to put ETH as a collateral and borrow assets against it. You can use your ETH to provide liquidity at AMMs like Uniswap and Sushiswap and gain fees from doing so. You can use your ETH to buy all kinds of NFTs, from profile pictures, to in game assets for games like Axie, to NFTs that will grant you exclusive benefits such as access to a DAO. You can use your ETH to yield farm. You can use your ETH to swap tokens on chain, trade with leverage and buy options.

Something equally as big or even bigger as the demand for DeFi and NFTs is the possibility of staking your ETH to help secure the network and gain a yield from it, made possible by the switch to PoS.

ETH locked in DeFi protocols has gone from less than 5 million at the beginning of 2020 to more than 35 million in 2021. While the amount of ETH being staked has hit more than 8 million, before the Merge has gone live. The number is expected to increase much faster once the Merge is live, as the execution risk will be lifted and withdrawals of the ETH gained will be enabled shortly after. 

We have gone from not being able to do much with ETH in the years prior to 2020, to be able to do all kind of things with it. It’s possible to never have to sell ETH by generating a yield from it or getting a loan against it.

The demand for ETH has been going up year after year, more and more users are buying ETH as a long-term investment, once again adding significant buy pressure on the ratio. The move to PoS will accelerate this trend.

&#x200B;

Why is the Merge so important?

It helps solve two of the four issues, the first one being the most important. The high pressure ETH has before the merge makes it very hard for the ratio to sustain a high number, and almost impossible to maintain the flippening if it were to happen. Once the Merge goes live the sell pressure will be mostly eliminated, and the four issues will finally be all solved and allow the flippening to happen. Something else which is equally as important is the massive demand the Merge will enable for ETH, millions and millions of ETH will be bought and accumulated to be staked.

There’s of course a lot of work remaining, especially in the scaling side but the four main points don’t need to be perfectly solved for the flippening to happen. Solving the scaling issue will be fundamental for ETH to become the global settlement layer, which will be the focus of part 3.

&#x200B;

TLDR

Four main reasons were making the flippening very hard to achieve:

\-High sell pressure, fixed by EIP 1559 burning most of the fees and the Merge reducing new issuance by 90% plus replacing miners with validators, which are less likely to sell their ETH. With almost all the sell pressure eliminated, the ratio can go up much more easily.

\-Lack of fee capture, fixed by EIP 1559, all the fees burned act as a buy back mechanism, billions and billions of dollars in fees burned going to ETH holders acting as upward pressure on the ratio.

\-Not enough scale, fixed by L2s. Users with small to medium amount of capital are now able to use ETH directly, ETH will be collecting more fees and gaining huge amounts of ETH investors.

\-Insufficient demand for ETH in previous years, fixed by DeFi, NFTs and the demand to stake ETH.

&#x200B;

As usual everyone loves predictions, so here is mine, the flippening has a very high chance of happening in the next 6 months after the Merge has gone live.

"Is a bet on Loopring a bet against ""The Merge"" or ""Ethereum 2.0""?","New to crypto, learning all I can, but do not (yet) see how all the available coin options can logically coexist.  Per the Loopring docs: 

""Loopring is capable of settling more than 2,000 trades per second on Ethereum 1.0.""

But isn't Ethereum progressing toward ""The Merge"" to ""2.0"" (the scare quotes are because I know these are oversimplifications-- the move from proof of work to proof of stake) in the coming years that should increase the speed, reduce the gas fees (and the miners), and eliminate the need for L2 platforms built on top of 1.0?   So, does Loopring essentially bet that it's going to be a long time and a lot of needed transactions before there is the next iteration of Ethereum? 

Phrased differently- It seems to me the value proposition of Loopring is that processes on Ethereum 1.0 have gotten so unwieldy that there needs to be a good L2 platform, and it is fitting that current niche.  But isn't ""2.0"" supposed to eliminate the niche?

Thank you for the tolerance as well as the flames.",21.0,2021-11-03 17:02:41,0.93
Correction for something I said allowed an attack during the merge,"I want to make a correction, because previously I said there was an attack vector in the ethereum merge.

&#x200B;

What I said was... if the merge happens at a specified block, and since eth2 doesn't validate blocks, it has no way of knowing if the eth1 chain is passing them the true blockchain during the merge... Someone would be able to mine a false block at the merge and eth2 would have no way of knowing if it was correct or not.

&#x200B;

Yesterday I learned how this attack is avoided. The merge spec was updated to include a defense to this attack. Instead of the merge happening at a specified block height, it will happen at a specified difficulty level. Since no one can determine when that difficulty level will be reached, no one can pre-pack a false block and re-write the eth1 chain and send it to eth2 at the time of the merge. It's a pretty smart solution.",27.0,2021-11-03 04:06:13,0.79
GameStop NFT Platform + Loopring --> Ethereum L2 Ecosystem COVERED!!! **OPINION & EDUCATION**,"Hi Fellow Apes – I am sure you have been hearing a lot about Loopring and their LRC Coin but it may be fuzzy as to how they COULD fit into the picture. I am hoping to help by digging a bit deeper than surface layer exploring. If this looks too long and you want to skip to the Meat, jump down to Ethereum Layer 2 Ecosystem. You will want to read that one.  Also, I like using a single data source and feel that Coin98 does a nice job, by no means is this a plug of their service.  None of this is Financial advise, my black lab is my Financial Advisor.

There are a lot to choose from, but from all indicators it appears GameStop is going with Ethereum. I LOVE this choice, for many reasons, so let’s compare the Top-Tier.

I underlined a few categories that Ethereum blows away the competition. Seriously, just look at Total Value Locked (TVL) – yes, that is with a B for Billion. The best part, where Ethereum does not have an advantage (say Proof-of-Stake vs. let’s say Binance (BSC), after the MERGE in early 2022 they will have these features. So, not too far in the distance all other advantages will be negated.

Not surprising, Ethereum is the 4th popular blockchain platform in this space. One main reason is GAS. With Loopring, that is about to change so do not get stuck here, keep reading 😊. Oh, if you need a bar chart to make you smile, here is one.

**Total Validators**

Why are Validators Important – yeah, they are an essential part of the Proof of Stake consensus mechanism, they are essentially the moderators of the staking system and have the EXTREMELY important job of authoring new blocks on the chain. In other words, greatest variety of staking options for the community and protects the system by preventing the chain from being controlled by one very wealthy individual. Cough #KennyLies

What is a Layer 2 Scaling Solutions again? Essentially, they increase throughput without tampering with any of the original decentralization or security characteristics that are integral to the original blockchain.

I would NOT be surprised if GameStop uses a combination of Layer 2 Solutions, for example I would be a bit shocked if GameStop did not use Polygon (Mantic in the above) for Gaming. One reason is that Polygon extends plug-and-play software development kits (SDKs) for developers such as Ubisoft, Electronic Arts, others, enabling them to integrate blockchain attributes into non-blockchain games.

My research for Ethereum energy consumption after the merge,"Hello ethfinance community,    
as some of you might have read in my posts in the daily I just finished a postgrad research project on Ethereum energy consumption under Proof-of-Stake. I wanted to share this with those of you interested.    
[You can find the full report here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/f1nle6ioiyz5wbf/%E2%80%98Proof-of-Stake%E2%80%99%20as%20a%20solution%20to%20the%20blockchain%20energy%20problem.pdf?dl=0)    

**For all others, I'll quickly summarise the results:**

[Ethereum (mining) is currently estimated to use around 80 TWh of energy annually.](https://digiconomist.net/ethereum-energy-consumption)
 
I tried to model energy consumption for Proof-of-Stake.    
Currently there are about 250,000 active validators. I split validators into two categories: private stakers and institutional stakers. Private stakers are people running a setup from home (or hosted on a cloud server). Each staker currently runs 5.4 validators on average. Because they probably don't have setups optimized for energy consumption, I estimated every staker to use 100W of energy, so about 18.52W per validator.
For institutional stakers, such as exchanges, I used 5 W per validator, as suggested by [Carl Beekhuizen from the Ethereum foundation](https://blog.ethereum.org/2021/05/18/country-power-no-more/). Currently about half of validators seem to be run by each category. **This puts the current estimated energy consumption at 2.94 MW or 25.754 GWh annually.**    
For the future I have considered a limit of 524,000 validators as proposed by Vitalik in the past. I made one model assuming the share of private vs institutional stakers remains 50-50 and one that assumes a shift towards circa 25-75, since there will probably be more people using staking services rather than setting up new own validators in the future. **The last scenario, which I find to be more likely, puts power consumption at 4.31 MW or 37.756 GWh annually** (the 50-50 scenario would mean 6.16MW / 53.98 GWh annually).    

**Overall, the transition to Proof-of-Stake represents a decrease in energy consumption by at least 99.93 to 99.95 percent compared to current PoW**    
So instead of using as much power as the entire country of Chile, Ethereum will only use the equivalent of between 710 to 1650 average Australians in the future.    

Of course those numbers could change slightly in case the maximum number of validators ends up significantly higher or the stake needed for a validator were to change, but this model at least is able to demonstrate the magnitude in difference for power consumption between PoW and PoS.    

PS: Please don't be too harsh on my report, the main focus was on the environmental impact of Ethereum and the technical details are very simplified. If you want to share my report somewhere, please dm me.",191.0,2021-11-02 11:53:24,0.99

**Frequently Asked Questions**

**Where's the best place to buy ETH?**

There are many centralized exchanges that support Ethereum. If you live in the US, the most popular exchanges are Coinbase, Gemeni and Kraken. Coinbase users can use Coinbase Pro for lower fees.

**When is Eth2 launching?**

Eth2 is a marketing term used to represent a number of updates to Ethereum. The Eth2 proof-of-stake chain first launched in December 2020. ""The Merge"", which is the event that will fully switch Ethereum's consensus to proof-of-stake, is estimated to be ready in early 2022, although there is no exact timeline. Other updates, such as data shards, will follow that update.

Visit [ethmerge.com](https://ethmerge.com/) to learn more about ""The Merge"".

**Do I need to do anything to update to Eth2? Will Eth2 create a new token?**

No, ETH holders *never* need to take any action to keep holding ETH. Ethereum users will be unaffected by the Eth2 upgrade. And the Eth2 updates will not create any new tokens.

**How can I stake my ETH?**

There are two ways that you can stake your ETH: by running your own validator, or providing your ETH to a staking pool.

* Running your own validator requires a modern computer and 32 ETH. Visit /r/ethstaker for more details
* Staking pools accept any amount of ETH. We recommend [Lido](https://lido.fi/) or [StakeWise](https://stakewise.io/)

**Why are Ethereum transaction fees so high?**

Like most blockchains, Ethereum fees are determined by supply-and-demand. The large demand to use Ethereum has pushed transaction fees quite high (however, fees were just a few cents only 2 years ago). Fees are especially high during market volatility, and during NFT drops.

**What is being done to lower Ethereum transaction fees?**

Ethereum fees are reduced by using layer-2 rollups. Rollups are scaling solutions that allow for significantly cheaper transactions, while still maintaining Ethereum's security.

Additionally, Eth2's data shards will make rollups even cheaper.

While rollups are cutting-edge technology being actively developed, a number are already live on Ethereum mainnet. Visit [l2beat.com](https://l2beat.com/) to learn more about rollups.

**What's the best wallet for Ethereum?**

The most popular tool for using decentralized applications is Metamask. However, for security reasons, we recommend using a hardware wallet such as a Trezor or Ledger.

I made it,"So, I guess I “mi” - made it. I reached some quantitative goals (1 mill in the bank for buying a house, a “never-sell” stack with 1 mill stablecoins and a few ETH2 validators, and a play bag to increase my never-sell stack with, currently about another 1 mill), and my qualitative goal (desk shitting\*). Here’s my story. A huge caveat though; this is one big festival of survivorship bias. Due to timing and luck you can’t copy my strategy straight off.

What did I do? I got lucky with an investment I made in the company I worked at, and found myself with 100k. I studied ETFs, Bogleheads, and made a plan - and got bored. I realized that 100k on its own was pretty pointless. I would have to keep working the same hours, and lead basically the same life. My life quality with the 100k and without the 100k would be pretty much the same. If I had 1 mill though - now we’re talking! So I aped in on ETH and BTC in March/April 2019 with 100k, in a sea of red.

In order to keep an eye on my investment I read everything I could about crypto, especially the Ethereum ecosystem. I was trawling Twitter for macro risk and alpha every single day. When yield farming slowly started popping up in Q1 of 2020 I put some of my savings that I had in the bank in stablecoins in Andre’s early iEarn project, and Curve. I tried my hands at leveraged trading - and lost quite a few ETH on dydx in the early days. And I played around with everything DeFi, just to try things out, because it was fun.

You see where I’m going with this. Airdrops. Motherfucking airdrops everywhere. I must have gotten at least 0.5 mill out of Curve, vested over a year. 1 mill from Dydx, if we include all the trading rewards I made in the first epoch before the volumes were up. It was like stealing candy from babies, for every trade you made a fistful of Dydx tokens. Uniswap, 1inch, Badger, Tornado, Git-whatever; I have forgotten most of them. But so. Much. Free. Money. I remember telling my wife about Curve back in the days. “So, eh, I’ve been using this crypto protocol, and now they want to reward early users, so I’m getting a ton of free internet money and we may get rich”. She looked at me as if I was crazy, or getting scammed big time, or about to go to jail. 

Here’s what I learned:

You probably won’t make it until your second bull run. You need the first to dip your toes and make the mistakes, and you need the second to go in with conviction. 

The first rule is to have an exit plan, and to stick to it and not change it when euphoria hits. You need ultra-conviction focused on a narrow bag to develop your diamond hands to not sell too early. You marry that bag. You’ll get abused by that bag from time to time, but you smile, and hold its hands through the bad times. Then finally! Things get rosy, and your future looks bright. That’s when you need to do the difficult thing and dump it. And it’s horrible! You’ve spent so much mental energy to hold on, it’s part of your identity, and then you have to break its little bag-heart and dump it. The first time I sold off some of the Eth and Btc it felt like a huge betrayal.

The best way to maximize risk/reward is to find an edge. There is a lot of information asymmetry in crypto - learn to find it. The market is far from efficient. The halvings are never priced in. The merge certainly isn’t. Just learn to find those asymmetries, and exploit your edge with conviction. You don’t need leverage if you have time and high conviction.

Don’t underestimate memes, and people’s greed. I guess I don’t really have to say this, since you can see it in the top 10 list on Coingecko. The trick is to remember it when everything’s red though. It will happen again, and your chance will come.

So long. I’ll be back for questions, but it may take a while.

"If you hold Ethereum, you should be rooting for SHIB. Here's Why"," Fourth try to post this.

The reason Ether holders should be thrilled that SHIB has high trading volume is that SHIB is built on Ethereum as an ERC-20 token.

Since August, Ethereum devs implemented EIP-1559 which introduced the ""burn"" mechanism for Ethereum. In a nutshell, every time Ethereum processes a transaction, a part of the fee is burned.

This drastically reduces the supply of Ethereum(and will even further reduce it once Eth 2.0 comes out).

So, every SHIB traded back and forth means more Ethereum burned. Actually, according to [ultrasound.money](https://ultrasound.money/), SHIB is one of the top burners of Ethereum in the last month.

Once Ethereum becomes a Proof of Stake chain(2.0), Ether issuance will plummet to about half a percent per year. That combined with the burn mechanism will make Ether a deflationary asset.

The more Ether that's burned today, the less there will be come time for the merge to Proof of Stake.

Supply and demand.

SHIB traders, do your thing. We'll see you on the moon.",270.0,2021-10-30 03:01:24,0.71

"Layer 2 is the future of Ethereum scaling, says Vitalik Buterin","[https://www.investing.com/news/cryptocurrency-news/layer-2-is-the-future-of-ethereum-scaling-says-vitalik-buterin-2656471](https://www.investing.com/news/cryptocurrency-news/layer-2-is-the-future-of-ethereum-scaling-says-vitalik-buterin-2656471)

 While making a speech at the 2021 Shanghai International Blockchain Week, [Ethereum](https://www.investing.com/crypto/ethereum/eth-usd) co-founder Vitalki Buterin suggested that Layer 2 was the future of Ethereum scaling and the only way to safely scale the network while preserving decentralization.

Buterin revealed that the initial phases of Eth 2.0 would soon be launched, and the Eth 2.0 roadmap would offer scalability. However, base layer scalability for applications will come as the last major phase of the upgrade, which could be years from now.

>*Ethereum scaling is not just an idea, but a clear roadmap where many pieces of that roadmap have either been developed or already been released or are well in progress.*

Efforts to make Ethereum more scalable, secure, and sustainable have been going on behind the scenes, and the Eth2 upgrades are being deployed progressively.

The first Eth 2.0 upgrade, “Beacon Chain upgrade,” was implemented in December. It introduced staking to the Ethereum ecosystem, and the Ethereum mainnet’s merge with the Beacon Chain’s proof-of-stake system will signal the end of proof-of-work consensus. The Merge is scheduled to take place in 2022.

After the Merge, “sharding” is next on the development plan. It is a multi-phase upgrade to improve Ethereum’s scalability and capacity through the use of shard chains to spread the network’s load across 64 new chains.

Going further, Buterin admitted that the need to make Ethereum more scalable is a top priority, but Ethereum’s native scaling (sharding) would take a long time. Therefore, “Rollups,” a Layer 2 solution that handles transactions outside the main Ethereum chain (layer 1) but posts the transaction data on layer 1 was launched to cause a significant increase in scalability up to a factor of 100.

Layer 2 solutions that have been launched so far include Polygon Hermez, Loopring, ZKSync, Optimism, and Arbitrum One. Buterin pointed out that the current cost to transfer ETH on Polygon Hermez is $0.25 compared to $6.84 on Ethereum.

Buterin admitted that Ethereum had embraced rollups as a scaling strategy for the near and mid-term future, and optimistic rollups, which are easier to create, are likely to be preferred in the short term. However, ZK rollups, which are way more complex but more secure, were likely to be preferred for the long term.

Zero-knowledge rollups (ZK rollups) run computation off-chain and submit a validity proof to the chain, and are much faster than optimistic rollups, which can take about a week for withdrawals.

There is still a lot of work to be done despite the upgrade in technology and applications to rollups, and Buterin urged application developers to actively work on adopting rollups as soon as it is safe enough.

Finally, Buterin added that non-financial applications could switch to rollups to help reduce fees as users were growing weary of high fees.

Other applications that could benefit from rollups are NFTs, Ethereum Name Service (ENS), light-clients, and decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs).",117.0,2021-10-27 00:23:12,0.89
Vitalik Buterin: Layer 2 is the future of Ethereum scaling Ethereum’s creator explains why rollups can help scale Ethereum while preserving decentralization.,"Ethereum, the second-largest cryptocurrency after Bitcoin, crossed the US$500 billion market cap mark for the first time this month, according to CoinGecko data. Amid the explosive growth of decentralized finance (DeFi) and non-fungible tokens (NFTs), scalability has been a key issue for Ethereum as the applications and number of users continue to grow. 

Layer 2 is the future of Ethereum scaling and the only safe way to scale Ethereum while preserving decentralization that is so core to the blockchain, said Ethereum creator Vitalik Buterin in a speech today at the 2021 Shanghai International Blockchain Week.

The Eth2 roadmap offers scalability and the earlier phases of Eth2 are approaching quickly, but base layer scalability for applications is only coming as the last major phase of Eth2, which is still years away, Buterin said. 

Work has been underway to make Ethereum more scalable, secure and sustainable with the Eth2 upgrades taking place progressively. The Beacon Chain upgrade, implemented in December, marked the first of the Eth2 upgrades and brought staking to the Ethereum ecosystem. “The Merge” — Ethereum mainnet’s merge with the Beacon Chain’s proof-of-stake system — will mark the end of a proof-of-work Ethereum and is scheduled to take place in 2022. Sharding, a multi-phase upgrade to improve Ethereum’s scalability and capacity through the use of shard chains to spread the network’s load across 64 new chains, is planned to follow in 2022, after The Merge. 

Buterin acknowledged that there was an urgent need to make Ethereum more scalable but Ethereum native scaling (sharding execution) would take a long time. Rollups — a Layer 2 solution that handles transactions outside the main Ethereum chain (layer 1) but posts transaction data on layer 1 — had already been launched and could provide a significant increase in scalability up to a factor of 100.

Layer 2 solutions that have been launched include Polygon Hermez, Loopring, ZKSync, Optimism and Arbitrum One. The current cost to transfer ETH on Polygon Hermez is US$0.25 compared to US$6.84 for Ethereum, Buterin said.

The Ethereum ecosystem is all-in on rollups as a scaling strategy for the near and mid-term future, said Buterin, adding that optimistic rollups, which are simpler and easier to build were likely to be preferred in the short-term. 

In the long-term, however, ZK rollups, which were more complex but had strong security, were likely to be the preferred, Buterin said. ZK rollups — zero knowledge rollups that run computation off-chain and submit a validity proof to the chain — are much faster compared to optimistic rollups, which can take about a week for withdrawals.

Enterprise applications could also use ZK rollups — when the technology was ready — and enjoy low fees without the need to have a separate private blockchain, Buterin said.

See related article: Vitalik Buterin: Why Eth2 will propel Ethereum’s use in enterprise

Despite the progress in the technology and applications moving to rollups, a lot of work remains to be done. Buterin urged application developers to actively work on moving to rollups as quickly and safely as possible. Non-financial applications, in particular, could move to rollups to reduce fees as users were not willing to pay high fees for them. NFTs, Ethereum Name Service (ENS), light-clients, decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) could also move to rollups, Buterin said. 

Ethereum virtual machine (EVM)-compatible rollups provide scale while preserving user experience, developer experience and decentralization, Buterin said. “Ethereum scaling is not just an idea, but a clear roadmap where many pieces of that roadmap have either been developed or already been released or are well in progress.”

Over $2B in Ethereum Has Now Been Burned By EIP-1559,"About $2 billion worth of Ethereum (603,452 ETH) has now been burned by the Ethereum network, fueling the furnace that’s driven the cryptocurrency to its latest all-time high. 

Ethereum started burning ETH after EIP-1559 was introduced on August 5. The mechanism removes about $30 million ETH from circulation each day by sending it to a defunct address. This replaces the previous method of paying ETH to miners for validating transactions.

EIP-1559 was designed to hasten a long-anticipated upgrade called Ethereum 2.0. The upgrade verifies Ethereum transactions with proof of stake, an energy-efficient algorithm that replaces the computationally heavy proof of work mechanism.

While Ethereum is expected to “merge” with the proof-of-stake Ethereum 2.0 blockchain by early 2022, it will still take a few years before Ethereum 2.0 has the same smart contract capabilities that Ethereum has today

"Dear ETHTRADERS, Mark Your Calendars for Oct. 27","We all have been talking about ETH 2.0 and change of PoW to PoS. And things are finally coming in action. 
Ethereum developers are making an effort to cut down energy costs, as well as vastly improve performance. Indeed, Ethereum’s Merge will bring one of the largest overhauls the network has ever seen. As a way to ease into this major transition, the network is undergoing a “warm-up” upgrade on Oct. 27.

The upgrade, called Altair, will be what the development team calls a “a warm up for 2.0"". The purpose of this late October update will be to get its node operators and developers ready for the larger changes. As part of this, all node operators and validators have to update their version of the network’s client in order to participate in the new proofing consensus. In fact, those who abstain from updating can face fees imposed by the network. Users of the Ethereum blockchain do not have to do anything in anticipation of the upgrade.",38.0,2021-10-19 05:44:13,0.95

**Frequently Asked Questions**

**Where's the best place to buy ETH?**

There are many centralized exchanges that support Ethereum. If you live in the US, the most popular exchanges are Coinbase, Gemeni and Kraken. Coinbase users can use Coinbase Pro for lower fees.

**When is Eth2 launching?**

Eth2 is a marketing term used to represent a number of updates to Ethereum. The Eth2 proof-of-stake chain first launched in December 2020. ""The Merge"", which is the event that will fully switch Ethereum's consensus to proof-of-stake, is estimated to be ready in early 2022, although there is no exact timeline. Other updates, such as data shards, will follow that update.

Visit [ethmerge.com](https://ethmerge.com/) to learn more about ""The Merge"".

**Do I need to do anything to update to Eth2? Will Eth2 create a new token?**

No, ETH holders *never* need to take any action to keep holding ETH. Ethereum users will be unaffected by the Eth2 upgrade. And the Eth2 updates will not create any new tokens.

**How can I stake my ETH?**

There are two ways that you can stake your ETH: by running your own validator, or providing your ETH to a staking pool.

* Running your own validator requires a modern computer and 32 ETH. Visit /r/ethstaker for more details
* Staking pools accept any amount of ETH. We recommend [Lido](https://lido.fi/) or [StakeWise](https://stakewise.io/)

**Why are Ethereum transaction fees so high?**

Like most blockchains, Ethereum fees are determined by supply-and-demand. The large demand to use Ethereum has pushed transaction fees quite high (however, fees were just a few cents only 2 years ago). Fees are especially high during market volatility, and during NFT drops.

**What is being done to lower Ethereum transaction fees?**

Ethereum fees are reduced by using layer-2 rollups. Rollups are scaling solutions that allow for significantly cheaper transactions, while still maintaining Ethereum's security.

Additionally, Eth2's data shards will make rollups even cheaper.

While rollups are cutting-edge technology being actively developed, a number are already live on Ethereum mainnet. Visit [l2beat.com](https://l2beat.com/) to learn more about rollups.

**What's the best wallet for Ethereum?**

The most popular tool for using decentralized applications is Metamask. However, for security reasons, we recommend using a hardware wallet such as a Trezor or Ledger.

Ethereum Value Proposition: Short & Sweet Edition,"This is a follow up to the 2 **Ethereum Value Proposition** posts I did 6 months ago before the ETH price blew up from $1,900 ->$4,400. Am posting here once again as an update and and because things are looking like they are coalescing again for another significant run. So here we go:

**EIP 1559**: My previous post stated ""The current rate of ETH being produced daily is about 14,000 so that means we would cut the net issuance of ETH roughly by HALF in a short time AKA by this calculation EIP 1559 would be an instant halvening for Ethereum .""
Sure enough that is what we have seen, watchtheburn.com shows that we are currently burning 56% of the total issuance so we actually experiencing a GREATER than halvening effect since EIP 1559 has been implemented.

The implications of this cannot be understated. Every 4 years after bitcoin has undergone its own halvening, roughly 6 months after it has gone on its parabolic bull runs. EIP 1559 began August 5th, so January would be the 6 month mark......we are 2.5 months away.

**The Merge**: Guess what else happens in January/Q1 of 2022?
The Ethereum 2.0 merge to POS, where issuance (new coins minted) will be drastically cut by 90%. At the current levels of burning, ETH would actually be DEFLATIONARY burning 2% of its total supply yearly once the merge happens. See ultrasound.money for details. 

The price implications of this also cannot be understated. ETH could potentially be the world's first exponentially rare high yielding, multi-faceted, productive asset. 

If in 3 months we found out the world didn't have any more oil underground and we had to basically make do with what we have on hand, that would be the analogy for ETH. You can imagine what would happen to the price of oil.

**L2 Solutions**: this is a little bonus speculation Im throwing in. Right now the 2 big Ethereum scaling solutions are live, Optimism and Arbitrum, and together they have roughly 90-100 million locked up in TVL and this number is growing by the day. The 2 solutions are planning on scaling up their transaction speeds to 100's of transactions per second in the next several months, Arbitrum with its ""Arbitrum Nitro"" promising 20-50x current transaction speeds which will also dramatically lower fees and Optimism doing a steady rollout of increasing its TPS over time.

Once these 2 chains are more fully rolled out they will be processing 100's of TPS and all of this will be confirmed on the mainchain where guess what, more ETH will be burned in processing those tx's. 
If (more like when) this happens the number of transactions happening on Ethereum will dwarf the entire rest of the crypto ecosystem PUT TOGETHER and the value of the Ethereum network will be far far too significant to ignore.

There are plenty of other indicators/factors/developments at play that are extremely bullish for ETH: crypto gaming on the horizon, NFT's, traditional investors like Cathie Wood and ARK repositioning themselves heavily to ETH, projects like Rocketpool and Alchemix, etc but I just chose to cover the most basic bullish cases to keep things simple.

**TL:DR** ETH is becoming the best version of money the world has ever seen. But don't take my word for it. DYOR. See you in 6 months.",36.0,2021-10-14 20:27:04,0.91
2021's Top 3 Gamified Yield Farming Apps," 

Yield farming is the method of lending or staking crypto tokens so that high returns can be generated in the form of some additional cryptocurrency. I believe it really pushed DeFi up, what do you think? The idea behind gamified yield farming allows users to earn money from each in-game asset that they at the time own. There are other games as well, like live battles, betting and more. I believe it is a great way to destress and make money a little fun, what do you think? With high returns also comes greater risk, so always watch out for scams that can make you lose your money. Here is a list of some of the platforms that are trusted by many investors like us:

2021’s Best Gamified Yield Farms

1. ArenaSwap ArenaSwap is the very first Dex project to be on the Binance smart-chain. It is here to merge exciting NFT, gambling and gaming opportunities with yield farming. This decentralized exchange platform is one way that offers storytelling and gamification into the world of yield farming and gambling, accordingly helping in increasing the asset’s value.
2. PancakeSwap PancakeSwap is also a decentralized exchange. It functions in the same way as Uniswap but is on the Binance Chain instead of the Ethereum blockchain. More of its features are focused on gamification. PancakeSwap is a very interesting platform as you can indulge in BSC token swaps, interest-earning staking pools, a betting game where you need to predict the future price of BNB and even NFTs. It has been a great addition to the defi space.
3. ZooKeeper Zookeeper offers an experience of dual farming while implementing the prevalent crypto trend of NFTs. ZooKeeper(defi platform) basically is a yield farming app that offers gamification built on Wanchain. It is sure to provide you with a fresh experience as I have noted. ZooRena adds on this by offering in-game events, wagering, live battles, and NFT boosting that increases the interaction in the community. The $ZOO token being used in games has eventually seen a rise in its price too. It all makes Zookeeper an interactive and fun gamified platform with profit-earning potential.

I think these platforms have made token staking really fun. What are your thoughts on gamified platforms as an investment in yield farming",31.0,2021-10-14 20:21:11,0.82
The conversation is changing about Ethereum,"The more time I spend working in this space, the more I am amazed by all that is happening. It blows my mind!  


Recently I have had a lot of family and friends asking me about crypto. While some still ask things like ""X Coin is only 2 dollars should I buy it?"" many are starting to ask questions like, ""what are layer two solutions.""   


This is HUGE... When my best friend's 70-year-old mother asks me about Layer 2 solutions or what advantages Ethereum has over Polkadot, I realize that this ecosystem we call blockchain/crypto is no longer fringe.   


We are headed into the mainstream. This is fraught with difficulties, and we still have so much to overcome, especially with governments accepting it (regardless of our power to continue without their blessing).   


So anyone who knows more than someone else, do not treat others like they are dumb, consider yourself lucky, and offer your knowledge to others freely.   


When you help others understand, you grow at the same time.   


Things that get me excited in the near future:  
\- Fully launched Layer 2   
\- The Merge  
\- Countless projects spooling up now that they are able to utilize Layer 2  
\- Gaming on the blockchain  


Thank you all for what a ride this has been! We are just getting started :)

"""Why are fees so high?"" answered from first principles, including the long-term solution","My goal with this thread is to link it whenever the question comes up because it comes up *a lot*.

I think that simply answering ""Use L2"" isn't helpful for someone who's not be aware of what L2 is or why there's a need for rollups in the first place when they're asking ""why can't Ethereum just make the fees cheaper, [other blockchain] is cheap!""

And I find that a lot of the existing documentation on it can be estoeric and overwhelming for someone who doesn't know what gas actually is and all they see is the final number in USD quoted by MetaMask, so ideally I want each bullet point to easily follow from the previous one. Any criticism/nitpicking/questions are welcome.

* So first, what *is* gas? Conceptually, 1 unit of gas = 1 unit of computation. A ""transaction"" on Ethereum is just code being executed, so in theory a smart contract could just do an infinite loop and use an infinite quanity of gas. But whoever pays for that transaction would eventually run out of money.

* The simplest transaction uses 21,000 gas to transfer ETH from one accout to another. That 21,000 gas is basically the ""cost"" of verifying the digital signature to prove you own the address. There's gonna be that 21k gas overhead in all transactions.

* Transferring an ERC20 token from one account to another involves interacting with the token's smart contract, and the actual gas used will depend on the actual implementation. But in general it can be around 65k gas. Doing a token swap on Uniswap is even more expensive because there are a lot more checks involved regarding liquidity, swap fees, slippage, etc on top of the 65k gas transfers. So anywhere between 120-200k gas.

* See the comments below for a follow-up on the more techy aspect of gas with all the terms and calculations involved, but what you need to understand is that the more complex a transaction is, the more gas it'll consume. A transaction that uses 200k gas is ""twice as expensive"" to execute in terms of computation than one that uses 100k gas, so it'll be twice as expensive in ETH terms. If all transactions cost the same, an attacker could slow down the network by spamming it with transactions that are heavy in computation. But with this gas system, the cost scales with the computation, so such an attack can get prohibitively expensive fast.

* On average, a block has space for 15 million units of gas. (The hard limit is actually 30M but with a little caveat)

* And on average, there's a new block roughly every 13 seconds. This means 15 million gas / 13 seconds = only about 1.15 million units of gas are available every second.

* Everyone fights over this 1.15 million gas per second, to get their transactions confirmed as quickly as possible. High demand + low supply = high prices. This is especially apparent when there's an NFT drop, as suddenly everyone wants to be the first one to mint the NFT, which can cause a temporary huge spike in gas prices.

* **Potential solution**: Make every block have 15 billion gas instead of 15 million. You just increased supply of gas by x1000 so gas costs 1000 times less. Your egregiously expensive $100 transaction now only costs 10 cents!

* But now there's 1000 times more information in every block. Remember, every node has to sync the entire blockchain, so that's an x1000 increase in required bandwidth and required storage goes up faster than before. This means the nodes will centralize to data centers and the network becomes less decentralized (Imagine the US government forcing AWS to kill all ethereum nodes) and easier to attack (miners have a lot more overhead so they stop mining, so a 51% attack becomes easier)

* This is already a problem with a lot of nodes running on Infura or AWS. In an ideal world, the blockchain should be able to be synchronized and stored by a regular computer. Bigger blocks don't help with that aspect, they hurt decentralization for a short term decrease in gas fees, which will in the end become just as bad in a few years when Ethereum usage go up x1000. 

* **Potential solution**: Use a different blockchain. This is potentially a good solution for your immediate needs, but the problems described above apply to all blockchains. So when demand isn't as high, fees will be cheaper. Or another blockchain might make some tradeoffs regarding decentralization and security, like how Binance Smart Chain only has a few validators checking everything, or Solana having harsh hardware requirements to run a full node, or Polygon running on a 5-of-8 multisig where 5 people could potentially collude to steal funds, etc.

* There's always trade-offs made somewhere for cheap and fast transactions. Trade-offs that Ethereum doesn't want to make when they cause problems long term. But if you're fine with it, there's no problem, go for it! Just be aware that if everyone flocks to a specific blockchain, the gas fee problem comes back because it's just an inherent economic aspect of high demand + low supply = high prices. 

* **Potential solution**: Use gas more efficiently. If you can find a way to use a thousand times less gas for the same transaction, then the fee will be a thousand times cheaper, with no trade-off being made regarding decentralization and security. This is the solution adopted by Ethereum. 

* This is where *rollups* come in. Think of them as blockchains running on top of Ethereum that take a huge load off by batching transactions together. We call Ethereum's main network *Layer 1* (L1) and rollups are considered *Layer 2* (L2). Gas on L1 will always be expensive, L2 is all about cutting overhead and using L1 gas more efficiently. 

* In the rollup blockchain, people make transactions and then every few minutes, the rollup commits the data to Ethereum in one big transaction that uses a lot of gas. If one of those big batch transactions uses 1 million gas, it'll be very expensive; After all, 1/15th of a block is being used by that single transaction. But if it contains the information of 1000 transactions, then each individual transaction only used 1000 gas, which is pretty cheap! (Remember, the lowest gas per transaction on Layer 1 is 21,000)

* The beauty of rollups is that once the data is committed, even if the rollup gets hacked or goes down, you can still get your funds back because the data's all there on Layer 1, proving that you own the funds that were on the rollup. This is why we say that rollups inherit the entire security of Ethereum while still being able to scale with cheap fees. 

* Rollups are still in their infancy, though. It can still cost a lot in gas fees to bridge from Layer 1 to Layer 2. This is mitigated by the various bridges protocols that allow direct transfers of ETH and tokens from chains like Polygon, BSC, Avax, etc. to the various rollups like Arbitrum and Optimism. And as the ecosystem matures, exchanges will roll out ""Withdraw to Arbitrum"" that'll allow you to buy ETH/tokens and move them directly to Layer 2, completely bypassing the high fees of Layer 1. 

* The absolute holy grail in terms of Layer 2 rollups is zero-knowledge rollups (zkRollups) which take all of the execution off-chain and use magic moon math to prove the result of the computation.

* Think of it this way: an expensive computation can be executed by a single computer and take minutes to complete, but the resulting proof can be verified instantly by everyone else, instead of the current system where everyone verifies the result by running the computation themselves. The math works out so that batches will become more and more efficient the more people use these zkRollups. This completely solves the gas fees problem: higher usage will suddenly mean cheaper individual transactions! 

* But we're not quite there yet, these things take a lot of time to develop and get adoption. Which is why the ""use a different blockchain"" solution is still a good one for now.

* But also, this zero-knowledge holy grail is coming much sooner than we think: StarkNet is going on mainnet in November, zkSync just announced a [zkEVM](https://twitter.com/zksync/status/1447985691900530689) that'll allow developpers to easily port their existing dapps on zkSync by using the same Solidity source-code. This is a huge deal! To give you an idea, just 2 months ago these things still seemed to be 4-5 years away. It's taking a long time if you're focusing on wanting cheap gas fees right this instant, but in the grand scheme of things it's happening so freaking fast it's actually hard to keep up with all the news happening constantly in the ecosystem.

* As far as the actual core development of Ethereum goes, it's all about helping these rollups thrive, mainly through sharding, which will basically give these rollups a lot more space to commit their batches. This is why all the Core Devs are focused on the merge right now, as Proof of Stake allows the possibility of sharding. 

* Other than that, rollups are being developped by independant teams and they each compete with each other and whichever ones survive in the long run will be the ones offering the best user experience (fast and cheap transactions, mainly). Same way how blockchains compete with each other right now, except we're starting to reach the limits of what stand-alone or ""monolithic"" blockchains can do. 

* So to conclude: Yes, gas fees are high and it sucks for the average person who wants to play in DeFi with $100's worth of ETH. But you're not supposed to use Ethereum for that. Ethereum's goal is to become the global settlement layer, a decentralized ""source of truth"" for all these rollups to use. Other Layer 1 blockchains won't come close to what rollups can do when actual global demand for DeFi and crypto actually kicks in.",54.0,2021-10-13 13:22:05,1.0
"""There will be a massive dump of staked ETH when the ETH merge happens!"" Here's why it won't likely happen","I've seen a lot of post about how there is expected to be a massive ETH dump come the PoW -> PoS merge due to validators now able to withdraw their ETH (since it has been locked up). I'm here to tell you how it likely won't be the case.

 


**Entering Validation**


Some information that might help understand is knowing how validators enter for validation on the ETH PoS beaconchain. When one submits sufficient ETH into the deposit contract, they'll enter a [queue of a set size](https://notes.ethereum.org/@vbuterin/rkhCgQteN?type=view#Activation). After 4 epochs, they'll be processed and will begin validating and gain rewards. You can see # of pending validators currently directly on the [beaconchain](https://beaconcha.in/) site.

 


**Leaving Validation (withdrawing)**

^^Note: ^^Withdrawals ^^won't ^^be ^^enabled ^^instantly ^^when ^^merge ^^happens, ^^but ^^some ^^time ^^afterwards. ^^Thanks ^^to ^^comment ^^from ^^/u/sn0w_l30pard

Now how a validator will exit validation (in other words withdrawal) is very similar. They'll also [enter a queue of equal maximum throughput of the queue to enter validation](https://notes.ethereum.org/@vbuterin/rkhCgQteN?type=view#Exiting). This means theoretically *each exiting validator will be replaced with an entering validator that is in queue to join*. ETH that would be withdrawn to be dumped will be offset with ETH that is now in validating.

 


**""What if nobody wants to enter validating but everyone wants to exit?!""**

This is a good question! You can enter to become a validator at any time now but can only withdrawal after the merge; there is definitely a case where people are just itching to cash out their validator rewards immediately, BUT there is also reasons after the merge one would want to become a validator as well.

You see as of the time of this post, [ETH PoS rewards APR is 5.5%](https://launchpad.ethereum.org/en/) (and even lower if using a service such as Coinbase as they take [25% of that reward as commission](https://www.coinbase.com/legal/user_agreement/united_states#:~:text=Coinbase%20will%20distribute%20any%20earned%20rewards%20to%20you%20after%20receipt%20by%20Coinbase%2C%20minus%20a%2025%25%20commission.); but let me tell you that this APR will jump massively after the merge. Why? Tips (priority fee). 

On the current Proof of work chain Ethereum uses, the priority fee (tip) is given to the miner for the given transaction. Come the merge, these tips will now be rewarded to validators. Justin Drake, a Ethereum researcher, [predicts APR as high as over **25%** post merge](https://mobile.twitter.com/drakefjustin/status/1384124998084792324). I can see people tripping over themselves to become a validator to get a piece of this cake, as it'll drop slowly over time as more and more validators enter.

 


Hope this clears some stuff up. thank you for coming to my ted talk

 


^Addendum: ^Justin ^has ^an ^updated ^model ^on ^APR ^post ^merge ^[here](https://twitter.com/drakefjustin/status/1424039388548321283?s=21). ^It ^has ^the ^APR ^to ^be ^best ^guess ^~13% ^and ^lean ^optimistic ^20%",61.0,2021-10-11 18:25:40,0.88
"Little Q&A with Syscoin lead dev that happened in Telegram. Touches on the NEVM, PoW vs PoS and ZKrollupes.","X, Q:
Does this mean the NEVM chain is essentially like a layer2 for the syscoin's POW chain?


Jag, A:
Not really.. it hasnt been done before.
Without PoW chain, NEVM chain cannot exist, PoW chain is ultimate authority. 

Validation depends on NEVM chain as well as they are both tied to each other but mainly whatever PoW chain says NEVM chain will follow.

With sidechains the consensus is usually not tied together.. they are seperate and usually bridged.. this is different as its all part of one protocol basically.

Diogo, Q:
But there’s still a bridge between assets, since they are so tied, isn't there a way to automate this bridge?

Jag, A:
The bridge is decentralized and part of the protocol. It can be pretty simple.. but most people will be on NEVM layer. 

They will not even go to SYS layer unless they want to HODL long term.  

Then you might want to have your coins sit on the PoW layer on a change address (for quantum resistance). 
Pali wallet will make it easy to cross either way. The dapp https://bridge-testnet.syscoin.org/ is only reference. 

Diogo, Q:
I was thinking more of cases where you want SPTs and compliance but still want to use the NEVM.. isnt this bridging in/out all the time be costly?

Jag, A:
Yeah, if you want to leverage SPTs then to cross to NEVM will be just 1 block confirmation. 

There’s no risk because everything is rolled back on both chains together so you can move coins and use them after 1 confirmation. 

X, Q:
So, does it work like layer 2 solutions such as Arbitrum where they use Ethereum as their security and validation layer? That means, NEVM is like Arbitrum and the Syscoin chain is like Ethereum?

Jag, A:
No because those are seperate consensus systems not tied together at a protocol level, ETH does not know what arbitrum is. 

In ours Syscoin knows what NEVM is and NEVM knows what Syscoin is. 
In ZKRollups on NEVM, that will be similar to ETH and L2 Arbitrum. 

In Arbitrum if Ethereum rolls back a. block Arbitrum won’t know this and in Arbitrum if a rollback happens Ethereum won’t know. 

So you need more trust assumptions and security mitigations which creates risk. 

X, Q:
Ohh... I'm trying to understand this idea of ""tied together"". What does tied together really mean? Since Syscoin and NEVM are separate chains, when we said tied together, do we mean they are able to read state data in contracts between the chains?

Jag, A:
NEVM chain can read in the smart contract on the syscoin block hash of any last 50000 blocks. 

Syscoin chain knows all of the NEVM chain block hashes and merkle roots. 

The process follows my article, PoW miner wants to create a block, he sends a msg via ZMQ socket to nevm node (geth) to package up a new block, sends to sys node, propogates SYS block with NEVM block inside, every block validats SYS block and passes nevm block data via ZMQ to validate NEVM block.. if  all is good SYS block is valid otherwise its rejected. 

Then chainlocks create finality on the PoW chain external to this process via masternodes locking the PoW chain based on what majority of masternodes see as the tip of the chain. 

Diogo, Q:
Do you think fast L2's can be dangerous?

Jag, A:
Optimistic rollups yes, ZKrollups no. 

Diogo, Q:
Because of slower finalities?

Jag, A:
No in ZKrollups you are guilty until proven innocent and in optimistic rollup you are innocent until proven guilty. 

Even though you are guilty until proven innocent the verification is exponentially scalable as more users use it. 

Innocent until guilty means court system can miss some cases just like real life. 

Diogo, Q:
Never read much about optimistic rollups, but I guess the name already implies that

Jag, A:
Yup, optimistic in regular case, pessimistic when needed to be but requires someone to be watch dog. But requires long wait times to exit as a result since rollbacks arent tied together they are seperate chains and seperate consensus from l1->l2...

Diogo, Q:
Yeah, thats pretty bad too in extreme cases

Jag, A:
In Zkrollups the state only updates and things are verified on the spot... so invalid states cannot exist. 

X, Q:
Just curious, since it's on POW, would it actually be taking up a lot of energy? I suppose that was the argument Ethereum has for moving to PoS?

Jag, A:
Wellif you think about the vision of blockchain, we are programming it for extreme cases. 
It’s merge-mined with Bitcoin. 
So unless you think bitcoin is going to disappear, SYS won’t either. 

There is no value for blockchain in regular circumstances.. its value is derived from being secure from SHTF cases. 

It’s borrowing energy from bitcoin, no new energy.. but PoW is cheaper than PoW anyway. 

X, Q:
What does merge mined with bitcoin mean? Sorry, this is the first time I'm hearing this.

Jag, A:
If you mine Bitcoin you are solving for a nonce, the miner increments this number until the hash fits with so many 0's infront of it which is gauged by difficulty. 

With that same solution you can apply it to other chains proving you solved difficulty more than a child chain. So you can mine multiple chains at once. 

X, Q:
ohh... POW is cheaper than POS in what way?

Jag:

POW is cheaper when factoring in all costs, external, internal and theoretical. 

Mostly it matters when hyper inflated values affect the staked resource ie: ETH is traded against USD and USD hyper inflates.. ETH security falls in line with the inflation. 

X, Q:
Ohh... Interesting idea. Am I right to understand that this would mean we will need Bitcoin miners to also mine Syscoin at the same time, except that they don't really have to redo the computation they had done for Bitcoin. They can reuse the computation that done to solve for Bitcoin and also for Syscoin. So the Bitcoin miners will have to install the Syscoin mining software as well. Is that the idea?

Jag, A:
So what we offer is the non syntheziable energy consensus that is nakamoto PoW securing a very secure court system (NEVM) layer 1 chain.. and scaling that using ZKrollups which do not take away any security just enables scale for global adoption. 

If ZKrollups existed when Crypto Kitties started, they wouldn’t be moving to PoS most likely.. another reason Vitalik wants to move to PoS is mainly because of light client security.. it’s too hard to run a full node yourself as a light node and too many trust assumptions. 

I counter that with PCD and math solutions coming out soon that will enable you to create validity proofs of entire chains meaning light clients will work trustlessly and you can move between any chain without any agents in the middle without trust. 

So light client security, and scaling are both not reasons for us to move away from PoW.. the only argument left is energy consumption.. which is a PRO for using PoW over PoS not against.. because during times of panic and volatility the PoS system has a higher chance of failing causing permanent loss. 

X:

Thanks for the insight! Really interesting! I always thought PoS is the way to go since PoW requires wasteful computations by all the miners. I'm not quite sure about the part where how panic and volatility to the PoS system can cause permanent loss though. I thought it's only the stakers who are proven to have attempted to put a fraudulent block will lose their stakes?

Jag, A:

Well during times of hyperinflation energy based chains will flourish becaues you cannot synthesize energy. There is no ""nothing at stake"" issue. 

i dont know at what point ETH becomes so easy to attack but I look at the relations to one or the other.. maybe it will be hard to attack ETH unless we are talking about hyper inflation like USD going to $1b to buy piece of bread. 

The problem with PoS is.. once it is attacked they must fork to fix it. 

In BTC you attack and it self regulates itself. 

They added finality into the equation because of PoS you need to punish validators and slash them.. once finality is added in, now it can get stuck because of that finality. 

I haven’t done a full deep dive as to what exactly are the costs to attack that type of system, but I look at likeliness compared to PoW and it looks like it gets easier and easier in relation to the other.. if its practical or not is left to the scientists to model it out under different contexts. 

X, Q:

I'm pretty new to this so I may not know what I'm talking but I'm guessing based on what you have said so far, it sounds like PoS would be more vulnerable for attack when the network is smaller? Eth has a pretty massive network. So maybe it's more difficult for them to be attacked. Many new and popular blockchains coming out are all using PoS and perhaps that kinda gives an impression to most people that PoS is the way to go.

Jag, A:

Devil is the tiny details. Once PoS breaks its broken for good. Until the hand that feeds it will course correct. All of that should be factored into the costs. 

X, Q:

Ahh... So that means solidity smart contracts won't be able to get deployed on the NEVM chain?

Jag, A:

Solidity will work it is an EVM. 

X, Q:

Ohh... Amazing! So NEVM runs the smart contracts in an EVM environment? Cool!

Jag, A:

Yup, its best to read that medium article. 
It explains everything fully. 

X, Q:

That would mean the usual tools we use for developing solidity on Eth will also work on NEVM? Meaning, we only have to change the RPC endpoint to NEVM and it will work?

Jag, A:

Yes, ""stick to gold standards"".",24.0,2021-10-11 16:03:45,0.95

**Frequently Asked Questions**

**Where's the best place to buy ETH?**

There are many centralized exchanges that support Ethereum. If you live in the US, the most popular exchanges are Coinbase, Gemeni and Kraken. Coinbase users can use Coinbase Pro for lower fees.

**When is Eth2 launching?**

Eth2 is a marketing term used to represent a number of updates to Ethereum. The Eth2 proof-of-stake chain first launched in December 2020. ""The Merge"", which is the event that will fully switch Ethereum's consensus to proof-of-stake, is estimated to be ready in early 2022, although there is no exact timeline. Other updates, such as data shards, will follow that update.

Visit [ethmerge.com](https://ethmerge.com/) to learn more about ""The Merge"".

**Do I need to do anything to update to Eth2? Will Eth2 create a new token?**

No, ETH holders *never* need to take any action to keep holding ETH. Ethereum users will be unaffected by the Eth2 upgrade. And the Eth2 updates will not create any new tokens.

**How can I stake my ETH?**

There are two ways that you can stake your ETH: by running your own validator, or providing your ETH to a staking pool.

* Running your own validator requires a modern computer and 32 ETH. Visit /r/ethstaker for more details
* Staking pools accept any amount of ETH. We recommend [Lido](https://lido.fi/) or [StakeWise](https://stakewise.io/)

**Why are Ethereum transaction fees so high?**

Like most blockchains, Ethereum fees are determined by supply-and-demand. The large demand to use Ethereum has pushed transaction fees quite high (however, fees were just a few cents only 2 years ago). Fees are especially high during market volatility, and during NFT drops.

**What is being done to lower Ethereum transaction fees?**

Ethereum fees are reduced by using layer-2 rollups. Rollups are scaling solutions that allow for significantly cheaper transactions, while still maintaining Ethereum's security.

Additionally, Eth2's data shards will make rollups even cheaper.

While rollups are cutting-edge technology being actively developed, a number are already live on Ethereum mainnet. Visit [l2beat.com](https://l2beat.com/) to learn more about rollups.

**What's the best wallet for Ethereum?**

The most popular tool for using decentralized applications is Metamask. However, for security reasons, we recommend using a hardware wallet such as a Trezor or Ledger.

Why I believe Ethereum Validators Do Not Owe Income Tax Until Exit," 

Pre-req.  I am from the USA and am speaking from my knowledge of USA taxes. This  may or may not apply to your country. And I may or may not be correct. I  am simply sharing my inferences and asking for thoughts on this matter.  Seek out a local tax professional.

I am specifically speaking about validators paying income tax (I am  not talking about capital gains tax). And am trying to figure out at  what point does a tax liable event occur for a solo ethereum staker.

Here is the IRS crypto guidelines I am referencing. [https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-drop/rr-19-24.pdf](https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-drop/rr-19-24.pdf)

In previous posts I argued that ethereum validators do not owe taxes  until after eth2 is operational (after the merge, when withdrawals are  enabled) because they do not have possession of the crypto they earned  until then. This is in line with the IRS's guidelines on hard forks and  airdrops. That a tax liable event does not occur until you have dominion  control over the funds. In other words, you do not owe taxes until you  receive money.

To expand on this, I am now arguing/inferring/questioning that a  validator does not receive the eth earned from staking until they exit  the deposit contract. Either voluntarily or involuntarily. Therefore  there has been no realized income until exit of the contract.

Using the text from the link I provided...

""A taxpayer does not have gross income under § 61 as a result of a  hard fork of a cryptocurrency the taxpayer owns if the taxpayer does not  receive units of a new cryptocurrency.""

I am not sure if this is addressing hardforks specifically or  crypto/income in general. In general does a tax event not occur until  taxpayer receives funds? I would argue yes... you do not pay taxes on an  IOU until the event of money being received occurs. A bank giving a  loan does not owe taxes on the loan until money is received. A business  who does work in advance doesn't have a tax liability until the job he  did is paid for (partially or impartially).

The reason I am referencing IOUs and debt is because that is how I am  viewing ethereum staking rewards. It is my view that the ethereum  staking rewards do not exist until exit of the deposit contract. The eth  earned from staking is not available to be bought/sold on the market,  nor available for the user to trade until after exit of the deposit  contract. And a staker does not have control of this eth, until the  deposit contract is exited. That upon a validators exit (either  voluntary or involuntary) the contract executes code to create that eth  and pay it to the validator's address. This view that I am taking is  relying heavily on the withdrawal contract to execute a ""create and  transfer"" command.

Thereby, the eth in question is neither created nor received until the exit code is completed.

Additional text from the IRS guidelines:

""Under § 61, all gains or undeniable accessions to wealth, clearly  realized, over which a taxpayer has complete dominion, are included in  gross income.""

The eth staking rewards are not clearly realized until completion of  the deposit contract's exit code, because of what I said above. That the  eth is not created nor received until exit. And that the IRS does not  classify income that you do not receive as taxable income.

Additionally, that complete dominion does not occur (even after  withdrawals are enabled) because the validator is still subject to  involuntary exits. Which would occur due to a buggy client or a failing  ISP or power outage. Therefore, due to these events, which is completely  out of the control of the person/entity running the ethereum validator,  that person/entity does not have complete dominion.

This is something I believe should be addressed by the IRS (or  whatever tax authority your local country has) because the implications  are massive.

This would mean that a person running multiple validators does not  owe income tax on the eth received from any validators until they are  exited from staking.

For example, if Johnny starts running 10 validators in 2021. He can  choose to exit only one validator in 2023 and have a income tax  liability for only that one validator. Leaving his other 9 validators  with deferred income tax until they are exited.

Let's say that one validator is exited per year. He will have deferred income tax on his last validator for 10 years.",54.0,2021-10-11 04:41:04,0.9
"So, have at me, tell me why Syscoin isn’t worth my investment?","I’m really keen to know. It seems to be ignored on these forums, when I all I see is a huge investment opportunity.

They merge mine with Bitcoin and are on the precipice of offering PoW Ethereum smart contracts that will scale without losing being decentralised by q1-q3 next year. For DeFi to be fully fledged they will need this guaranteed gold standard of security in the merge mining with Bitcoin. So why is everyone sleeping on this?",26.0,2021-10-09 23:03:14,0.88
Every day for the last week 10k ETH was burned.,"Last week 70.435 ETH was burned for a dollar value of $253.616.898.

In total 486.720 ETH ($1.755.810.163) has been burned since the rollout of EIP-1559.

At this rate about 3% of the total supply would be burned a year. Currently miners get about 4% in new supply. Ethereum’s inflation rate thus has been slashed by 75% to 1% of total supply a year.

Once the merge goes out, and if this rate of burning keeps up, then ethereum will become deflationary with its total supply reducing by 2% a year.



Tldr. Burn, baby, burn!",27.0,2021-10-09 13:01:15,0.74
3 Upcoming Catalysts for ETH! (2021-2022),"Just a compilation of some upcoming bullish catalysts for Ethereum!

There are so many catalysts, do feel free to add in the comments!

# 1) The Merge (Transition to Proof of Stake)

**Estimated timeline: \~Q1/Q2 2022**

**Why is this bullish:** Plenty of reasons including,

* Tremendous energy efficiency
* Lower issuance (even lower inflation, makes existing ETH more valuable)
* Miner fees/tips will go to validators (increased staking rewards)

# 2) Sharding

**Estimated timeline: \~2022**

**Why is this bullish:**

* Improve Ethereum’s scalability and capacity
* Reduce gas fees
* Significantly more transactions per second (TPS)

# 3) Ethereum ETFs in US

**Estimated timeline: Shortly after Bitcoin ETFs (which could itself be in 2021/2022)**

**Why is this bullish:**

* Leads to more institutional buying and demand
* Adds even more legitimacy to ETH as an asset

Companies applying for ETH ETFs include:

* Bitwise
* Kryptoin

There are already Ethereum ETFs in other countries like Canada, so it's not a big stretch to assume it will eventually come in US as well!",25.0,2021-10-09 04:03:57,0.82
SML NFT World,"&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/tlf4rl94d6s71.png?width=1200&format=png&auto=webp&s=c0c66ad77093ecfe72c99035a2ea03f958bcf7c9

An [NFT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-fungible_token), or non-fungible token, is an irreplaceable, non-interchangeable entity that is unique and encoded into the blockchain. SML NFT World was born out of the necessity to introduce DeFi and blockchain technology to music.

**What is SML NFT World?**

SML (Super Music League) is the world’s first music entertainment NFT project, jointly established by the global crypto world technology team, music artists, and game creators. SML uses NFT technology to transform the intangible value of music, artists, and music lovers in real life into a unique asset in the crypto world. Cryptographic assets in the SML ecosystem are constantly decreasing under the destruction mechanism of application scenarios, and these crypto assets will generate incredible commercial value in the long term.

SML is not only an NFT game but also a pioneer in NFT expansion to [Metaverse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metaverse) music. The concept of Metaverse, a science-fiction successor to the Internet, refers to the “ultimate form” of the web. It describes a world in which people interact with software as avatars in three-dimensional space. SML has been entangled with Metaverse since its inception. Users in SML are not just passive players but can play, create, and trade on their own terms, just like in real life.

After the outbreak of novel coronavirus, music artists and the industry of traditional music have all been negatively affected by various restrictions. However, the rapid development of the NFT music market has bred significant business opportunities. SML Music Metaverse integrates elements such as music, DEFI, poker, and Monopoly, and collaborates with many music artists and traditional music entertainment leaders to create a complete Metaverse music scene, providing opportunities for extensive digital entertainment, social connections, and business development.

**How does SML NFT World work?**

SML NFT world has 1 million constant blind boxes. The blind boxes are divided into two levels: common and unusual. The prices are different for different levels. Each blind box is designed in the form of poker in four colors: spades, hearts, plum blossoms, and squares. There are 13 pieces of each color from A to K, giving 52 pieces in total. The four colors represent four music elements: *spades* correspond to music artists, *hearts* correspond to performance scenes, *plum blossoms* correspond to playing instruments, and *squares* correspond to music fans. The blind box needs to be purchased with SML. One NFT card of each blind box is randomly selected from 52. Each blind box can only be opened once, and the remaining 51 will be destroyed. One to ten blind boxes may be purchased each time.

Each NFT card has a specific music performance income value. The basic ticket income of different numbers is different and divided into 5 levels. The larger the number, the greater the ticket income. NFT cards can be purchased, sold, placed, replaced, and removed.

NFT cards can also be combined with card books to obtain SML tokens. The card books have a variety of specific combinations, and the basic ticket income of the combined card book’s NFT cards will take effect. Different numbers can also get different combination bonuses. Players with the card book can remove and replace the NFT cards in it. The replacement will change the total ticket income. If you don’t want to continue to hold the card book, you can remove it to dissolve the card book. Ticket income is calculated as follows: Total player ticket revenue = basic ticket revenue \* (1 + combination bonus + combined card bonus) + invitation bonus.

There is a linear relationship between the total amount received today and the amount destroyed yesterday. Players receive today = total personal ticket revenue / weighted average of total network ticket revenue \* total amount received today.

NFT cards can be purchased or listed for sale in the trading market. The premise of the listing is that the player has NFT card inventory in the card package. The premise of the delisting purchase is that the player holds SML token inventory, and the selling fee is 5%, purchases are feeless.

One of our proudest features is that 99% of all SML tokens consumed in buying blind boxes will be destroyed; the remaining 1% will be given to players as a reward and 100% of the transaction fee SML will be destroyed.

**Tips from the team:**

* Because BSC blockchain smart contract technology is used, your BNB will be deducted for each operation (we decided on BSC because of the cheaper gas fees relative to Ethereum).
* It is recommended to purchase 10 blind boxes at a time because the use-cost of blockchain for purchasing 10 and 1 is equal (every transaction has a fixed cost regardless of whether you buy 1 box or 10).
* Don’t underestimate the invitation bonus (inviting other players to join SML NFT World will get you an invitation bonus.).
* Try to buy unusual blind boxes, the income is significantly higher.
* Changing cards or forming groups among friends can multiply efficiency.

We recently had our smart contract audited by Know Chuangyu, an independent third-party company who reviews smart contracts to confirm their safety. Hence, our smart contract is verifiably secure and our users can enjoy our platform with the peace of mind that all associated data is safe.

**Present and Future:**

Since our launch, we have had explosive growth and community engagement! The community actively participated in the game, fully interacted with the SML team, and made several valuable suggestions. We owe many thanks and have sincere appreciation to the community for the support of our project. Because of the support and engagement, SML NFT World has recently formed a DAO, enabling public voting on community proposals and implementing resolutions as necessary based on these suggestions.

The team is proud to announce that we are now included on [TockenPocket](https://www.tokenpocket.pro/). As we continue on this journey to merge music with elements of NFT blockchain technology, DeFi, poker, and Monopoly, we are always striving to improve the user interface and spread the joy of our platform to the world. Learn more about us by visiting our website and following us on social media!

**Summary:**

We are proud of the progress we have recently delivered to our users and continue to work on improving our user experience on our platform. Our smart contract has been audited and determined to be safe by a third-party auditing expert.

# Why ETH will hit $20K

* [Original source here](https://newsletter.banklesshq.com/p/why-eth-will-hit-20k)

### What does Bitcoin's halving teach us about Ethereum's PoS merge?

>*When you look at current prices and you take into account the efficiency gains of removing proof-of-work after the merge, we’re looking at 13 billion dollars per year…of buy pressure relative to what we have today.  -* Justin Drake, Bankless

Token economics is a growing field of study that ties the programmatic emission of tokens with incentives to drive economic outcomes. It’s nascent and confusing. There are multiple ways to value a token, just like there are multiple ways to value equities (DCF, DDM, comparables).

Other factors will certainly matter like regulation, network usage, EIP-1559, but if all else were equal, we could oversimplify why Ethereum will be valued at $20,000 after proof-of-stake to just one reason: Issuance.

Issuance is the number of new coins that are created every day in a crypto network. However, it’s not necessary to understand why issuance exists to understand why Ethereum is grossly undervalued: simply take note that issuance is a necessary aspect of all cryptocurrencies and is associated with the cost of securing a crypto network. 

To keep things simple, the cost of keeping a crypto asset’s price stable is equal to the number of coins issued per day multiplied by the price per coin.

Let’s take Bitcoin, for example. In the case of Bitcoin, 900 new bitcoins are created every day. If each bitcoin is valued at $45,000 then the cost of keeping Bitcoin’s price stable is at around $40.5 million per day. By “stable” I mean that there must be $40.5 million in *new* demand to offset the increased supply from daily issuance.

Ethereum also has issuance, around 13,500 ETH are issued every day. At a price of an average of $2,000 per ether in 2021, it currently costs around $27 million per day to keep Ethereum’s price from dropping.

The big change that is about to happen is that Ethereum will undergo an upgrade that will reduce its issuance by 90%. I am [referring to](https://email.mg2.substack.com/c/eJwlkclOwzAQQL8mvhF5y9KDD5RVSIBALOop8jJ1TVI7sh1Q-XocKs0izaKZeaNlBhviScwhZbSaIZ9mEB5-0gQ5Q0RLgjg4Iyghm6YnHTKCG9I3PXJp2EeAo3STyHEBNC9qclpmF_zaQVpMGnQQioPscGtUT7VUjPR7aAnfKwPQA4XmPFcuxoHXIOAb4il4QJM45Dynil1W9LaICTrVNgQ7Qa3DsUTSHEGadADIaS0oSt5SNMos6T3M_OlBfX_dbdXz59v7z-7-4sFa8rIdX5qrvBsuxlIOxuWKMutMxa4xcoLicijGHcW456ymNTAFVLeMMs4IaFPPNDje_I4Vx0dL67SolKUe15VQFNcfN6-PNzvclrRd0fzHC5mh-OPiXT4N4KWawJyh5TP7f4yDBQ-x_MQMMhd-jLWsYy3FbHOGVKhySjdN1zeoDDahdHmhpB8nSOkPD2aaAQ) Ethereum’s full transition to proof-of-stake. Again, you don’t really need to understand what proof-of-stake is to follow my argument, just understand that it will reduce the number of new ETH created every day.  

This article predicts a fair long-term price of ether at $20,000 after the merge. The first part of my argument is very easy to understand: just simple algebra.

### The Algebra of Issuance Reduction

Today our daily issuance is: 

>*13,500 ether x $2,000 per ether = $27 million* 

This means that the cost of keeping the price of ether from going below $2,000 is $27 million per day. After the transition to proof of stake, we will have a reduction of 90% in issuance, bringing it down to around 1,350 new ether created per day: 

>*1,350 ether x* ***$20,000*** *per ether = $27 million* 

In other words, if the market continues to pump $27 million per day into ETH (*as it has been doing throughout 2021*) after proof-of-stake, the price of ether must increase to $20,000 per coin. 

How quickly will this happen?

The rest of this article answers this question using a method called the [inelastic market hypothesis](https://email.mg2.substack.com/c/eJwlkD1vhDAMhn_NZUTB-QCGDJV63bp0qNQJhcTHRUCCklBEf33DIVm2bMt6_bxGZxxDPNQaUiZn6vOxovK4pxlzxki2hLF3VkFdd6KtG2IVt3UrWuJS_4iIi3azynFDsm7D7IzOLvjzopa0FuSpKJONQNO1DQPZPTgDazQiGhikkEZfunqzDr1Bhb8Yj-CRzOqZ85pu7O0GHyX2fa_8gLEKcSztqleM6ZxD28mGOAW0PElpA5S2nFVQIRsQjGTAOKvR2GqF4Lj4m26cLiNUaRtS1maqTFhIVO_f96_P-w-VZT2eWK95oepLXTbv8tGj18OM9gLOl28vC_oRPcbip-11LuyMSdYwCZR1F2BxhAN0omkFKcI2lCuvBu2nGVP6B17AgmM). This hypothesis, developed by professors Xavier Gabaix & Ralph S. J. Koijen, puts forth the idea that markets respond inelastically to investors’ flows.

Using Bitcoin’s past halving cycles, I measured the inelasticity of the Bitcoin market and extrapolated it to Ethereum. The inelasticity factor found for Bitcoin was 20, which means that every dollar invested in Bitcoin makes the market cap increase by 20 dollars. Using this inelasticity factor, I predicted that, after proof-of-stake, Ethereum’s price should increase at an average rate of 8% per month due to the reduction of issuance alone.

## Inelastic Market Hypothesis: A Brief Background

Two months ago, an interesting piece began circulating in Crypto Twitter from Xavier Gabaix and Ralph S.J Koijen titled “[In Search of the  Origins of Financial Fluctuations: The Inelastic Market Hypothesis](https://email.mg2.substack.com/c/eJwlkD1vhDAMhn_NZUTB-QCGDJV63bp0qNQJhcTHRUCCklBEf33DIVm2bMt6_bxGZxxDPNQaUiZn6vOxovK4pxlzxki2hLF3VkFdd6KtG2IVt3UrWuJS_4iIi3azynFDsm7D7IzOLvjzopa0FuSpKJONQNO1DQPZPTgDazQiGhikkEZfunqzDr1Bhb8Yj-CRzOqZ85pu7O0GHyX2fa_8gLEKcSztqleM6ZxD28mGOAW0PElpA5S2nFVQIRsQjGTAOKvR2GqF4Lj4m26cLiNUaRtS1maqTFhIVO_f96_P-w-VZT2eWK95oepLXTbv8tGj18OM9gLOl28vC_oRPcbip-11LuyMSdYwCZR1F2BxhAN0omkFKcI2lCuvBu2nGVP6B17AgmM).” The authors put forth the proposition that today’s stock market reacts inelastically to investors’ flows. Their simplest model, which includes a bond market and an equity market, indicates that selling $1 in bonds and buying $1 in equities has the effect of increasing the equity market cap anywhere from $3 to $8.  Their paper goes on to demonstrate, both theoretically and empirically, why this is the case. 

The main reason for the inelasticity of equity markets, according to the authors, is related to the behavior of households and institutions, who hold the majority of equities in the US (*approximately 80%*). Both households and institutions are illiquid market participants, meaning that they buy equities and hold them for extended periods of time, regardless of price fluctuations. Why? 

In the case of institutions, they often have mandates which force them to keep a part of their holdings in equities. Households that do not actively trade the stock market often prefer a “buy and hold” strategy. This lack of liquidity in the equities market causes volatility, and this volatility can be quantified and explained by the inelastic market hypothesis. The inelasticity factor given by their study is 3-8, which means that for every dollar invested in equities, the market cap may increase from 3 to 8 dollars. 

This general behavior of households and institutions in the equity market reminded me of the HODL culture of the Bitcoin community, who pride themselves in holding their bitcoins regardless of price fluctuations. If volatility is so closely related to illiquidity, and if the inelasticity of equity markets is 3-8,  and knowing that this is caused by similar behavior in both markets, how much more inelastic is the crypto market if compared to the equity market? 

This is the first objective of this paper, to arrive at an estimate for the inelasticity of the Bitcoin market. The method used will be analyzing Bitcoin’s past halving cycles and measuring the effect that the supply shock from each halving had in accelerating the price increase of Bitcoin after the halving date. 

The second objective of this paper is to predict how Ethereum’s EIP-1559 and the transition to proof-of-stake will affect its price. This will be done by estimating the magnitude of the supply shock of each of these two events and factoring in the inelasticity factor found in the Bitcoin market.

## The Bitcoin Halving: A General Framework

Let’s understand how issuance works for Bitcoin: 

1. New bitcoins are created and sold on the market every day. 
2. The number of newly created bitcoins is abruptly reduced by half every four years. This event is called the halving. 

Let’s put our first point in context. If new bitcoins are created and put on the market every day, the overall supply of bitcoin increases every day. As you can imagine, if nobody were there to take these newly issued bitcoins off the market, the price of Bitcoin would tend to go down. This is easy to understand: if there is too much of something, it becomes cheaper. Hopefully, at some point, the price of this asset becomes cheap enough that people choose to buy an amount equal to what is being created, keeping the price stable. 

Let’s say that we have arrived at this stable price, at which the newly issued bitcoins are bought by a group of investors. 

If Bitcoin’s price remains the same for an extended period of time, this indicates that there is a constant demand for bitcoins. Otherwise, if there weren’t investors willing to buy the newly issued bitcoins, the price of Bitcoin would trend towards zero, as mentioned before.

### A Closer Look at Supply Shocks

So let’s think about the Bitcoin market right before the halving event. Come the day of the halving and, as expected, the issuance of bitcoins is reduced by half. If we assume that demand remains the same as it had been before, then this will force the price to go up over time because of the ensuing supply shock. 

For our paper, the supply shock will be the reduction in the number of bitcoins issued after the halving date. In other words, the supply shock equals the number of coins that would have been issued if the halving had not happened. 

My argument is that the supply shock multiplied by the average value per bitcoin accrues to the value of the Bitcoin network over time. This can be represented as “value invested,” since the flow of money works as an  investment of capital: 

>*supply shock x average price per bitcoin = “value invested”* 

“Value invested,” which used to keep the value of Bitcoin from decreasing,  now contributes to increasing the value of Bitcoin. The factor by which “value invested” increases the market cap, represented by h1, is the inelasticity: 

>*“value invested” x inelasticity = h1* 

Here is a simple example to clarify these concepts. Imagine you have an office building, and that you have to pay $100 every month for the air conditioning bill because it is summer. Every month your accountant writes off  $100 that goes to paying for the electric bill of the AC. When summer ends, you don’t need to pay $100 anymore because it is colder. Let’s say you end up paying $50 in AC bills now that summer is over. This means that you now have $50 dollars more to invest in your company. Now your accountant can register that you have a surplus of $50, which adds value to your business. 

The difference between the example above and Bitcoin (*and equity markets in general*) is the concept of inelasticity, which means that those $50 of “value invested” may actually accrue, say, $200 to the value of the asset  (*inelasticity factor of 4, in this example*). Also, the halving acts as a perpetual winter, which decreases your air conditioning bill by half, every four years.

Next let’s estimate these these variables: 

* The increase in market cap due to the supply shock, h1 
* “value invested” 

If we have these variables, we can arrive at the inelasticity of the Bitcoin market: 

>h1/ “value invested” = inelasticity 

This approximation of the inelasticity of the Bitcoin market can then be used to calculate the magnitude of the price change that Ethereum will undergo after EIP 1559 and the transition to proof-of-stake.

### The Bitcoin Halving Cycle: A Tale of Two Curves

Let’s use the 2016-2017 market cycle as an example of how to calculate the increase in market cap, h1, due to the supply shock, and “value invested”. The same process described below was used to infer inelasticity from the 2012 and 2020 cycles. 

Below is a chart of Bitcoin’s market cap beginning in January 2015, and ending around March 2018. I included some points on the graph, which represent the following dates: 

* **Blue**: Lowest market cap since prior halving 
* **Yellow**: Halving date
* **Red**: 100% increase in market cap from Halving date *(or a 2x increase in the market cap relative to the market cap on the halving date)* 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/esi50ymg93s71.png?width=1205&format=png&auto=webp&s=4d533a3e1b0b8a25ab834eaef8e8636e5b66481a

 

Blue, the lowest point since the prior halving, is our starting point. At this point, the price of Bitcoin has become so low that investors are happy to buy the new bitcoins that arrive on the market. The price is increasing from Blue to Yellow and then from Yellow to Red. We can be sure then, that the new bitcoins entering the market are being bought. Yellow is the halving date, the date on which Bitcoin´s issuance is reduced by half.

Since the price of Bitcoin increases steadily, as can be seen in the graph, we can express this upward trend as a slope, m1:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/62zse0jn93s71.png?width=1110&format=png&auto=webp&s=ad115b7bce6f0dd3b2552768b1edd775b58ba4d5

What does m1 represent?

The daily increase in the Bitcoin market cap prior to the halving date. For simplicity, I used a linear regression between these two points. Further research could focus on alternative regressions. So what happens around the actual date of the halving? If you take a closer look at the graph, in the vicinity of July, 2016, what happened was a typical “buy the rumor, sell the news” event.

After this noise, Bitcoin continued to go up.

The halving, it seems, was not priced in!

Bitcoin continues its upwards trend after the halving, but now at a faster rate, m2. We can represent the new rate of increase in market cap after the halving by drawing a second slope, m2, from the halving date to an arbitrary point on the graph, in this case, at 2x halving market cap.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/0ifqlhep93s71.png?width=1038&format=png&auto=webp&s=6e528cd9cfbe2ca162e9757a54aa6b4aa11ac11b

 Let’s take a step back to put all this in context with an example.

Before the halving, let’s say the price of Bitcoin was at $1,000 and that there were 50 bitcoins issued per day. If the price of Bitcoin was stable or going up over time, this means that the market was paying $50,000 a day for the newly issued bitcoins. After the halving, the market keeps paying these $50,000 per day; however, there are only 25 bitcoins being issued after the halving event.

At $1,000 per Bitcoin, what happens to those extra $25,000 dollars? They accrue to the value of the network! 

This is what I chose to call “value invested.”

“Accruing to the value of the network” is just a fancy way of saying that this money will be used to buy old bitcoins, or bitcoins that were not issued that day. Inelasticity is relevant in this context because those $25,000 may actually make the market cap of Bitcoin increase by $125,000 if the inelasticity factor is 5. The next section deals with determining “value invested” and the increase in the market cap due to the halving effect, which we will call h1.

#### Inferring Inelasticity from the Difference Between m2 and m1, “value invested,” and h1

Let’s imagine that the halving had not occurred. In this case, we can assume that Bitcoin’s market cap would have continued to increase at the rate of m1, and would most likely be near the green point on the graph. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/x93lihys93s71.png?width=1207&format=png&auto=webp&s=3ff3ce36de26390774bf1a8643471e0ad2c92eed

 

We can calculate how much of the increase in Bitcoin’s market cap after the halving was due to the halving effect. This can be done by taking the difference between the market cap at the red point and the market cap at the green point, which gives us the increase in the market cap due to the halving effect, h1.

Simple, huh?

Now comes the final step: determining “value invested;” it is equal to the number of bitcoins that would have been issued if the halving had not happened (supply shock) multiplied by the average price of these bitcoins: 

>*supply shock x average price of bitcoins = “value invested”*

Again, I call this “value invested” because this is the value that is invested in the Bitcoin network, the value that accrues to the Bitcoin network. If we divide h1 by “value invested” we arrive at a rough estimate of the 13 inelasticity of the Bitcoin market.

>*h1/ “value invested” = inelasticity*

### Results

Here are the values of inelasticity that I found for each Bitcoin cycle: 

* 2012 - 24.9
* 2016 - 20.7
* 2020 - 70.2

As you may imagine, I was pleasantly surprised at how close the inelasticities of cycles 2012 and 2016 were and disappointed at how different the inelasticity of 2020 was in relation to the other two. After giving it some thought, I arrived at an explanation for this. 

The Covid outbreak made markets plummet right before the halving, and the effects of quantitative easing quickly recovered these markets right after the halving, around May 2020. These two factors reduced the average price per Bitcoin before the halving and decreased the time it took for Bitcoin’s market cap to double after the halving (see [Appendix B](https://email.mg2.substack.com/c/eJwlkUtP7SAUhX9Nmdnw6mvAQK-nJvfqRI2JThoK-_aQ00LlodZfL7UJsMliryz4UDLC5PwmVhci2pchbisIC59hhhjBoxTAD0YLSkhXtaRBWnBN2qpFJgz_PcAizSyiT4DWNM5GyWic3R2kxqRCZ4GbTtcV553SDSO6aRjmHZVypFy1FdVHrkzagFUg4AP85iygWZxjXEPBrgva56GdCuXk3DRDqdxyKGkBG_dtnuT560_Cp_eRzi_ruQ_v29fdY3t1SfVN7zzhf_v70787nd6eJpXbQZtYsD6FtWC34Sy9sRMyguL8VIwbinHLWUlLYCNQVTPKOCOgdLlSZ3j1fSk4XiZahjSGKNVlvxTy4vbl9PhwesV1Pp52OL96ZjPkuiRr4jaAleMM-sAWD_q_IIcJLPj8K3qQMRNkrGYNqylm3YEpc-WUdlXTVigHa5ddVozSXmYI4QdWkJmH)). I share the frustration of other analysts who have had only three data points on which to base their predictions. Actually, in my case, one of those data points can be considered an outlier due to the Covid outbreak. 

Comparing to the Harvard paper, the inelasticity of equity markets was within a 3-8 range. We can tentatively say then that the **Bitcoin market’s inelasticity is \~20, which means it is 3-7 times as inelastic as equity markets.**

**To put this into simple terms, every $1 used to purchase BTC results in a $20 increase in its market cap.**

## Ethereum: what to expect from EIP-1559 and PoS

The next part of this paper assumes that the Ethereum market has a similar inelasticity as the Bitcoin market. Being the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap and displaying similar volatility movements as Bitcoin, this is a fair assumption.

On-chain data indicates that people have been holding ETH in anticipation of the transition to proof-of-stake, which is further proven by the reduction of ether on exchanges. Furthermore, the day-to-day price fluctuations of these two cryptocurrencies are near identical. Therefore, we can assume that their inelasticity values are similar. 

Knowing that both markets exhibit similar behaviors, we will use our baseline inelasticity of 20 to predict the price action of Ethereum after EIP 1559 and the transition to proof-of-stake. The steps I followed to calculate the monthly increase in the price of Ethereum due to its catalysts are essentially the reverse process of calculating inelasticity. 

 The results: EIP 1559 should increase the price of ETH by 2% a month; the transition to proof-of-stake should increase the price of ETH by 6% a month.

This means that the combined effect of both these catalysts is an 8% **increase per month**. This is an average value, which assumes that everything else remains the same. Short-term fluctuations in price are impossible to predict, I am interested in the long-term.

## Bringing it All Home, Where is the Price Headed? 

Consider this: in 2021 so far, ether had an average price of $2,000 and an issuance of 13,500 ether per day. This means that, at $2,000 per ether, the market needs an injection of $27 million per day just to keep the price stable at $2,000. Let’s say that ether remains near this price until the transition to proof-of-stake. 

>*daily issuance x price per ether = daily cost of keeping ether´s price stable*  
*13,500 ether x $2,000 = $27 million* 

So what happens when issuance drops by 90% after the transition to proof-of-stake? Well, let’s assume that $27 million keeps pumping into Ethereum. Then, let’s put our new issuance of 1,350 ether per day. At what price could ether be sustained?

>*$27 million / 1,350 ether =* ***$20,000*** *per ether* 

After the transition to proof-of-stake, ether will at least increase in price at an average rate of 8% a month, with $20,000 per ether being an acceptable price over the long term after 2022.

Many people will look at my $2,000 average price per ether with suspicion. These people could argue that using the average price of 2021 is biased since ether has seldom achieved these price levels before in its history. Perhaps it would be more realistic to use the average price of Ethereum going further back in time. 

The simple rebuttal to this argument is that the number of people who have entered the Ethereum community has increased in such a way that it is almost impossible for ether to revisit the triple-digit range.

Xavier Gabaix explained this phenomenon in his paper by saying that “a permanent shift in the demand for stocks must create a permanent shift in the equilibrium price.” If I were to use the average price of Ethereum using data from 2020, I would be disregarding the NFT mania, DeFi summer, the [Ultra Sound Money](https://email.mg2.substack.com/c/eJwlkLluwzAMhp_GGg2dtjNoKJBk69IhbSdDB2MLsWVXRwz36Ss3AEGCJHj8n1EJhiXscl1iQofr076C9LDFCVKCgHKE0DsrKSEn0ZEWWckt6USHXOzvAWBWbpIpZEBr1pMzKrnFHxOkwUSgUQrckYYa0XQl5-auTEcoB2Vadbdata-7KlsH3oCEJ4R98YAmOaa0xoq9VfRabNu2el9yyhpqs8xHRSUzVuz6rNhZf_6Mnoxfz5tBTlJc_sW4pRh3nNW0BqaBmoZRxhkBY-uVLo6L30fF8TzQOmYdkzKPYzMK8ny7fLxfvnFT2sOh8L9eBPYlztm7tPfglZ7AvrSnF8J_Gv0AHkJBa3uVCgbGGtayhmJ2emktcDilJ9F2ApXDdilTXmrlHxPE-AfJn4bk) meme, the Triple Halving meme, and other meaningful events and ideas that lured people to Ethereum this year. 

The market has been channeling $27 million per day just to keep ether’s price stable for over 8 months. From my perspective, 8 months is enough data points to defend my argument.

Some people might say: what about the ether that is being produced and held by miners? They are getting ether for a lower price than $2,000, so we cannot say that the market is necessarily paying $27 million per day to buy the new ether.

My answer: although it is true that miners produce ether at a cost lower than the market price, not selling this ether for a profit represents an opportunity cost to them. Also, since proof-of-work mining is a low-profit margin business, the cost of producing ether may not be that much lower than the actual market price.

## My Speculative Predictions for What is to Come

1. Ether will continue an upward trend throughout 2021. Corrections of \~30% as price moves up, reaching newer local highs. A \~50% correction will only occur in the case of a black swan event. 
2. After proof-of-stake, there will be a “sell the news” event, a correction no larger than \~20-30%. 
3. Ether is headed to a long-term price range of $20,000, the maximum price between 2022 and 2023 will likely overshoot this figure due to speculation, new market entrants, hype.
4. After the bubble pops, ether will stabilize at \~$20,000 over the long term, after 2022. 
5. In 2024, Bitcoin will undergo its 4th halving, moving the entire market to new all-time highs

## Final Thoughts

>*Importantly, the data are consistent with a quite long-lasting price impact of flows. Indeed, in the simplest version of the model, the price impact is perfectly long-lasting. This is not necessarily because flows release information, but instead simply because the permanent shift in the demand for stocks must create a permanent shift in their equilibrium price.* \-Xavier Gabaix, In Seach of the Origins of Financial Fluctuations: The Inelastic Market Hypothesis

Raoul Pal has said [that he predicts $20,000](https://email.mg2.substack.com/c/eJwlkLtuwzAMRb_GGg09_Rg0FEgytUuHop0MPRhbiC0ZkhzD_frKDUCQAAny8h6jMowhHnINKaMzDflYQXrY0ww5Q0Rbgjg4KykhvehIi6zklnSiQy4N9wiwKDfLHDdA66ZnZ1R2wZ8bpMFEoEn20HJoW2qs7UnfcyNoRwg2Wty1xXf-0lWbdeANSHhCPIIHNMsp5zVV7K2itxL7vtdH2PKmoTZhOTsqm6lit2fFLtf370P3UwjHiJykuPyLcUsx7jiraQ1MAzUNo4wzAsbWKw2Oi99HxfEy0jptOmVlHudlFOXl6_r5cf3BTRmPp8P_fjE4lLps3uVjAK_0DPblPb8Q_tMYRvAQC1o7qFwwMNawljUUs_7ltcDhlPai7QQqwjaULS-18o8ZUvoDuHGGzQ) for ether this market cycle, but he believes that the transition to proof-of-stake will be a “buy the rumor, sell the news” event. I agree with him, but I do not believe that we will have a cycle top in the vicinity of the transition to proof-of-stake. If we reach $20,000 before the transition to proof-of-stake I would interpret that as hype, because the market is not sophisticated enough to price this change, and I would expect a major correction. Reaching $20,000 can happen any time, keeping the price stable at $20,000 will be a result of flows of capital entering Ethereum over an extended period of time, after proof-of-stake.

Here’s an interesting ramification of my argument: every time Bitcoin undergoes a halving its price should at least double relative to its average price before the halving. Because other factors come into play after the supply shock resulting from the halving *(new market participants, hype…)* its price increases much more than that.

That is why I believe that Ethereum’s all-time high this cycle will be above its long-term price of $20,000.

The new all-time highs we reach now will serve as a reference for the next cycle’s expectations. Look at the quote above. “The price impact is perfectly long-lasting… A permanent shift in the demand for stocks must create a permanent shift in their equilibrium price.” You can be sure that whatever all-time high we reach this cycle will be surpassed on the next cycle. This much is obvious to a great part of crypto enthusiasts and is probably the reason why we did not revisit lower lows after the China ban of May 2021.

One final note: the timing of this event, the transition to proof-of-stake, is not a coincidence: this will be the bridge between Bitcoin’s halvings. It will prevent a longer crypto winter and speed up the adoption of cryptocurrency. A friendly, albeit perhaps unwanted, pat on the back of bitcoiners. 

We’re gonna make it.",1284.0,2021-10-07 20:46:31,0.88
Lighthouse Altair Release: v2.0.0 (Birdperson),"Hi ethstakers,
  
The Lighthouse release for the Altair upgrade has been published!

The v2.0.0 series sets the fork epoch for the Altair upgrade on mainnet, which is [scheduled for epoch 74240](https://github.com/ethereum/consensus-specs/pull/2625), i.e. Oct 27, 2021, 10:56:23am UTC. All mainnet users **must** upgrade to v2.0.0 before this date. Any validators that do not upgrade will cease to follow the chain, will miss 100% of their assigned attestations and blocks, and will be penalised for inactivity.

**TL;DR: Upgrade in the next few weeks or *perish*.**

We're also really excited to provide [checkpoint sync](https://lighthouse-book.sigmaprime.io/checkpoint-sync.html), which allows syncing a node from another trusted node in a matter of minutes. This is great for failure recovery and many other scenarios.

We've also optimized the way we verify attestations. Nodes that are struggling to process attestations and filling up their queues should see great improvements in this release. Our under-resourced Prater nodes saw a 50% decrease in CPU usage. On the other-hand, our well-resourced mainnet nodes didn't show much of a difference at all since they were already keeping up very well.

It's really exciting to be able to publish big release like this at the same time we're building merge testnets with the current execution (""eth1"") clients. What an exciting time for Ethereum.

**Frequently Asked Questions**

**Where's the best place to buy ETH?**

There are many centralized exchanges that support Ethereum. If you live in the US, the most popular exchanges are Coinbase, Gemeni and Kraken. Coinbase users can use Coinbase Pro for lower fees.

**When is Eth2 launching?**

Eth2 is a marketing term used to represent a number of updates to Ethereum. The Eth2 proof-of-stake chain first launched in December 2020. ""The Merge"", which is the event that will fully switch Ethereum's consensus to proof-of-stake, is estimated to be ready in early 2022, although there is no exact timeline. Other updates, such as data shards, will follow that update.

Visit [ethmerge.com](https://ethmerge.com/) to learn more about ""The Merge"".

**Do I need to do anything to update to Eth2? Will Eth2 create a new token?**

No, ETH holders *never* need to take any action to keep holding ETH. Ethereum users will be unaffected by the Eth2 upgrade. And the Eth2 updates will not create any new tokens.

**How can I stake my ETH?**

There are two ways that you can stake your ETH: by running your own validator, or providing your ETH to a staking pool.

* Running your own validator requires a modern computer and 32 ETH. Visit /r/ethstaker for more details
* Staking pools accept any amount of ETH. We recommend [Lido](https://lido.fi/) or [StakeWise](https://stakewise.io/)

**Why are Ethereum transaction fees so high?**

Like most blockchains, Ethereum fees are determined by supply-and-demand. The large demand to use Ethereum has pushed transaction fees quite high (however, fees were just a few cents only 2 years ago). Fees are especially high during market volatility, and during NFT drops.

**What is being done to lower Ethereum transaction fees?**

Ethereum fees are reduced by using layer-2 rollups. Rollups are scaling solutions that allow for significantly cheaper transactions, while still maintaining Ethereum's security.

Additionally, Eth2's data shards will make rollups even cheaper.

While rollups are cutting-edge technology being actively developed, a number are already live on Ethereum mainnet. Visit [l2beat.com](https://l2beat.com/) to learn more about rollups.

**What's the best wallet for Ethereum?**

Syscoin Smart Contract Public Testnet Is Live! ⚡,"&#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/tsf9owdntbq71.gif

Today is a *huge* day for crypto — the [Syscoin](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/syscoin/) Smart Contract Public Testnet is now live (yes, that's right — it's not a mythical whitepaper — it's a *living, breathing smart contract beast* waiting for you!) You can now build *whatever app you want* on top of the most innovative network in crypto!

## Sounds Cool, But Why Would I Build On Syscoin (Shouldn't I Just Build It On ETH or SOL)?

Well, to name just a few:

* Any app you can build on Ethereum can be built on Syscoin (DeFi? DEX? Other Dapps starting in D? You name it — you can build it here!) 🏗️
* The code is open-sourced — Syscoin has nothing to hide! 👀
* The Syscoin network has been audited by third party industry leaders (for both speed and security!) ✅
* Speaking of, Syscoin is ultra-secure (it's actually merge-mined with bitcoin — giving it the **second highest hash rate** of any crypto coin in the universe!) 🔒
* Did I mention its scalability was designed to accommodate ""smart cities""? 🏙️
* The Syscoin network is nimble and will power the NFT innovations for years to come (fractional / divisible NFTs, royalties, auctions, the [Luxy.io](http://luxy.io/) marketplace ...) 🖼️
* Want to make a serious stablecoin (or a silly meme-coin?) You can mint those for super cheap on Syscoin. 🪙
* The complementary Chrome-extension [PaliWallet](https://twitter.com/PaliWallet) will hit the Chrome app store on October 5th (one wallet for all of your SYS, BTC, ETH, MATIC / Polygon & Web3 needs!) 💻
* This team has a track record of delivering the goods since 2014 (true OGs!) 💪

PandaInu The Future of NFT Marketplaces.,"&#x200B;

[ ](https://preview.redd.it/hrltmswxh7q71.jpg?width=2155&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b82eb24b776e324ce8749bb1433f8bc5ae5f748b)

Over the last few months, NFT sales have been through the roof. According to the nonfungible market, during the first week of August, the total USD value transferred over 7 leading NFT marketplaces has crossed a total of $356 million. It’s evident from the graphs below that the NFT sales skyrocketed in the first week of August and the trend is continued.

**No signs of slowing down**

According to a 2020 year-end report by the Nonfungible community, the total market capitalization of the NFT sector was close to $210 million in 2019. The report suggested that in 2020, the market cap could touch $315 and by 2021, it could surpass $700 million.

Surprisingly, the NFT market capitalization has superseded the assumptions is currently sitting at over $33 billion according to Coinmaketcap. This clearly indicates that the NFT market is no more a fad as was believed in 2017 and holds the potential to become a trillion-dollar market in the future.

[**PandaInu** ](https://pandainu.io/)**Future NFT Marketplace Models**

PandaInu NFT marketplaces platforms will create an option platform where one can mint, store, display, and trade NFTs. These have played a pivotal role in the explosive growth of the NFT market cap.

As there are many types of NFT marketplaces, universal or collectible-oriented marketplaces are the most popular ones. That’s because sports and collectible NFTs are the most traded NFTs and contribute to over 60% of the total sales. But PandaInu is collecting all merge all of them at the same platform.

According to the PandaInu Research team, the top trends in the NFT marketplace are?

According to Dap Radar’s recent portfolio tracking tool, 85% of the DeFi users claim they have interacted with NFTs and this is a 10% increase since May 2021. Even the Ethereum blockchain usage clearly indicates that the unique wallets interacting with NFTs have surged by over 202%.

With so much interest exploding in the space, NFT marketplaces are looking at more ways to engage more NFT users. Here is what is trending:

**Moving to low gas-fees Layer 2 protocols**

[**PandaInu** ](https://pandainu.io/)NFT marketplaces will resolve the Ethereum gas fees issues first. And PandaInu platforms use the efficient Layer-2 solutions like Binance smart chain and Immutable-X. The expect transactions to consume 100 times less energy once Panda team migrate from Ethereum to Binance Layer-2 solutions.

Also, PandaInu team is working to integrate the Binance gasless layer-2 to developed specially to cater to NFT transactions.

As per the current PandaInu development community the potential of NFT trades will limited because of no cross-chain trading between NFT marketplaces. But this is gradually changing once the PandaInu NFT Marketplace will live for worldwide market. Decentralized Exchange’s like EIFI Finance will have announced launching a cross-chain NFT marketplace that will allow users to trade NFTs between Ethereum and Binance blockchain. Breaking these blockchain silos is crucial to unleashing the real potential of NFTs.

**PWT Airdrops tokens**

Recently, PandaInu airdropped PWT, the platform curation token to the users. Anyone with a PandaInu account received these free tokens. such airdropped have led to a rush of users to the platform that conducted the drop, and it seems to be becoming a new trend in the NFT place.

PandaInu NFT traders will move from universal NFT marketplaces to PandaInu platform in near future and it will be heading towards PandaInu platforms where all the users will get access to curated, high-end NFTs though our platform. To ensure only high-end NFTs are listed on PandaInu marketplaces, our platforms will be incentivizing curators with curation tokens. This means someone with experience in art curation can make an earning by simply curating NFTs on a marketplace.

**PandaInu NFT join the yield farming hype**

The NFT and DeFi worlds are trying to converge and take advantage of each other. Because of this, the yield farmers are now using PandaInu NFTs will be a new way to leverage digital assets through DeFi protocols. Many upcoming DeFi platforms are introducing innovative liquidity mining models where instead of farming rewards, liquidity providers are incentivized with illiquid NFT tokens. But PandaInu tokens can then be wrapped into NFT collectibles and sold in the marketplaces worldwide. Also, in-game PandaInu NFT trades will rise soon. Because of many popular games introduced an in-game marketplace and these turned out to be successful. And PandaInu will be the next leading NFT marketplace in the world.

**Wrapping it up**

PandaInu NFT marketplaces will be a very prominent aspect of NFT trading and could play a crucial role in the mass adoption of NFTs in near future. With the PandaInu platforms moving to scalable, cost-effective solutions and with more mainstream players entering the space, it seems we are on the verge of experiencing trading on next-generation NFT marketplaces.

"Get ready for merge: Make sure you can run a local execution client, like Geth","Currently, running an execution client like Geth, Erigon, Nethermind or Besu is entirely altruistic.

With the merge, the execution client will verify the execution payload on attestation. This is however still entirely altruistic, though highly desirable from a security perspective.

To encourage validators verifying the execution payload in the strongest possible way, Ethereum will very likely gain a Proof of Custody function, that slashes (not just penalizes, slashes) validators that do not do their own execution payload verification. This might not be ready in time for merge, in which case it'll come some time after.

Edit: To be clear, the official clients would always verify before attesting. The slashing threat is only for actors who seek to change the code to not verify and still attest. If your execution client is down, you'd just miss that attestation and be assessed on offline penalty for it. No big deal.

From the R&D Discord: ""I see, when proof-of-custody for execution is introduced outsourcing execution payload verification will become slashable. With PoC for execution in the roadmap I doubt Infura or any similar 3rd party service that is trustworthy will spend cycles on providing payload verification as a service. There should be no other option for stakers to run their own execution client starting from the Merge. It could be, though, until the PoC is introduced but we strongly encourage everyone to avoid doing that as it impacts the security of the network.""

You'll want to get ready now-ish, with merge possibly happening first half 2022. Make sure you can sync and run an execution client. What you'll need:

\- 1 or 2 TB SSD. Edit: 2TB probably highly preferred, as it allows you to run a backup client when you need to do maintenance (pruning, resync) on the main client.   
Make sure it's well cooled, we've seen at least one throttling issue with an M.2 drive. If you can get a model that doesn't use QLC and isn't DRAMless, it'll perform better for you. Good options might be WD Red, WD Black SN750 (but not SN750 SE), HP EX950, Mushkin Pilot-E. Samsung recently dropped the performance of the 970 EVO Plus, so I'm not recommending it any more. For external, Samsung T5 is a good choice. Samsung T7 is slower than T5.

\- 2 to 8TB monthly data cap with your ISP, depending on the number of peers you allow for the execution client.

\- 16 GiB of RAM on your node, or better. You can squeeze it into 8 GiB when choosing lean clients such as Erigon + Nimbus.

If ISP data cap is a major issue - it was for me - then good options right now are a VPS with fast storage - Netcup, Hetzner come to mind; or a dedicated bare-metal cloud box - Hetzner, OVH; or letting Blox run the node and running a remote signer in your AWS account that holds your keys.",31.0,2021-09-27 15:52:56,0.96

**Frequently Asked Questions**

**Where's the best place to buy ETH?**

There are many centralized exchanges that support Ethereum. If you live in the US, the most popular exchanges are Coinbase, Gemeni and Kraken. Coinbase users can use Coinbase Pro for lower fees.

**When is Eth2 launching?**

Eth2 is a marketing term used to represent a number of updates to Ethereum. The Eth2 proof-of-stake chain first launched in December 2020. ""The Merge"", which is the event that will fully switch Ethereum's consensus to proof-of-stake, is estimated to be ready in early 2022, although there is no exact timeline. Other updates, such as data shards, will follow that update.

Visit [ethmerge.com](https://ethmerge.com/) to learn more about ""The Merge"".

**Do I need to do anything to update to Eth2? Will Eth2 create a new token?**

No, ETH holders *never* need to take any action to keep holding ETH. Ethereum users will be unaffected by the Eth2 upgrade. And the Eth2 updates will not create any new tokens.

**How can I stake my ETH?**

There are two ways that you can stake your ETH: by running your own validator, or providing your ETH to a staking pool.

* Running your own validator requires a modern computer and 32 ETH. Visit /r/ethstaker for more details
* Staking pools accept any amount of ETH. We recommend [Lido](https://lido.fi/) or [StakeWise](https://stakewise.io/)

**Why are Ethereum transaction fees so high?**

Like most blockchains, Ethereum fees are determined by supply-and-demand. The large demand to use Ethereum has pushed transaction fees quite high (however, fees were just a few cents only 2 years ago). Fees are especially high during market volatility, and during NFT drops.

**What is being done to lower Ethereum transaction fees?**

Ethereum fees are reduced by using layer-2 rollups. Rollups are scaling solutions that allow for significantly cheaper transactions, while still maintaining Ethereum's security.

Additionally, Eth2's data shards will make rollups even cheaper.

While rollups are cutting-edge technology being actively developed, a number are already live on Ethereum mainnet. Visit [l2beat.com](https://l2beat.com/) to learn more about rollups.

**What's the best wallet for Ethereum?**

The most popular tool for using decentralized applications is Metamask. However, for security reasons, we recommend using a hardware wallet such as a Trezor or Ledger.

I don't use CEX but I do love your BSC and some offerings on your [pancakeswap.finance](https://pancakeswap.finance) like $MOOND from my man u/Mellon98 :P Buying Reddit $MOON with BUSD BEP-20 Token on MoonsSwap is quite convenient too. Bravo.

Now it's time for $SYSCOIN and its CTO's 0.9.2devcoin Counterparty branch for smart contracts on cheaper merge mined with BTC Chain for over 10 years to bring Bitcoin security to your EVM and Ethereum-based networks!!! [https://github.com/devcoin/core/commit/cf3e03bad10368d96294769b740841919b636810](https://github.com/devcoin/core/commit/cf3e03bad10368d96294769b740841919b636810)

Give Jag Sidhu his credit, he's going to shine when u see what he's done (devcoin-android)/counterparty and smartcontracts for later date for cheap and periodically update with the BTC main chain to updated periodically with difficulty/security among SHA-256G Merge Mined chains alongside Syscoin 4.2.2, Namecoin Core 0.22.0, Ixcoin 0.14.1, Devcoin's MM+counterparty OP\_Return 80 Byte limit for comments defying the 0.9.x Bitcoin ""Core"" slash so Counterparty can work its magic and bridge to EVM chains and back to original Bitcoin hashpower secured SHA-256 L1 chains - Devcoin would be the xDai to mint Rare Pepe's without insane minting fees on Bitcon L1 much like CryptoPunks mint on xDai as xDaiPuks but marketplaces will surely be built as its a specialty of Syscoin Platform and NEVM + Sys-Dev bridges are already in plans.

Devcoin is like a DAO. Distribution is community driven. Work is 10+ years old. People are coming back. Difficulty and distribution make it a great sidechain for BTC to utilize for when it adds its own expanded versions of NFTs, DAOS, SysCoin Markets, etc. so that the Mainnet can just be the settlement chain for all the networks around it like LN networks that build over the Segwit signature and validity data relayer parts separate from the BTC txn part of the txn tied to the Bitcoin Merkle Trees. The other parts SegWit separated allow cheap off-chain validation and proof of ownership etc cheap with only rare settlement going to court chain L1.

Anyway, just because its not a hot $ amount on a CEX like yours doesn't mean some of us carry on the layers that secure your future lucrative profits by further mining L1 coins some not even listed. Mining Tenebrix to support the first Scrypt coin in all crypto - Mining CoinyeCoin $COYE because the value of blockchain and p2p networks never dying despite going against a world wide celeb doesn't matter in this era and that's a land mark value for decentralized freedom for us node operators, the users.

Mainly, Binance,  I think you owe a little homage to why you're success has come so far and publicly. Devs that you never write of that keep [devtome.com](https://devtome.com) a doku wiki with tutorials for peanuts teaching people to use crypto since 2012. [Devcoin.org](https://Devcoin.org), the original funders of Bitcoin developers (even selling down DVC prices when complaints were made by Bitcoin devs that they wanted more lucrative BTC so we had to buy it). But we're coming back so be ready. And last time i checked a US based customer with SEC and EU approval to invest in real estate should be allowed to trade on your exchange. So why the hate?

Sys is gonna show you how long Security of the old slow SHA-256 Hash POWERED chains and distributed currencies like none other will be the basis of the Internet of Trust and DAO/Social communities that make their own money beneficiary from that early work soon enough. CZ, it's time to say the truth. For god sake you're trading the backbone of the internet ""ARPA"" 1963 (the first 3 college network with ""email"" connection and Bell Labs sponsored) with the RUB (fiat Ruble). if thats not a sign that  we can move on with the truth I'm telling you it is. Same reasons Canadians have royal charters that allow them to buy some amazing OTC stocks I luckily own but thru their pre Canadian nationhood Royal Bank of Canada or their SEC unreachable parent companies of TDA via Toronto-Dominion Bank.

Wake up Winklevosses - PAX partnership with BUSD is nothing compared to SEC untouchable Blockchain consultant and innovator (the creators of Syscoin Protocol, the public CSE:BCFN stock they are going to use to benefit the crypto project.. - you're about to get your entry into Us Equities after Canadian ADR's for Blockchain Foundry Inc. $BLFDF and the CSE trade $BCFN securities are untouchable by the SEC, the final dagger in old law to the new law - code is law - blockchain is unstoppable. Welcome CZ, Welcome Binance. Meet coins worth far more than anything you've listed and have 100's of devs who worked for peanuts to keep these secrets over a decade because theyre are building the next web, internet, and future of UBI and money for everyone to eat dinner, employers to hire, people to live in sheltered houses... thats why i love these FinTech projects. The donations aside of most of these DAOs and charity crytos back to [devcoin.org](https://devcoin.org) in 2011 - this is the way to give the world its health back, its happiness back, and its lack of concern for materialism they don't have.

I think that's why I like the Syscoin and Blockchain Foundry Inc. folks the best. They're clever geniuses and they have built everything that will make the North American supply chain and financial opportunities better for so so many people in to the south of them and I never had more pleasant encounters with people and was happier than 2013-2015 when I spent 3 hours playing baseball in Canada and absorbing all the cultural differences I could.

Blockchain Foundry Inc. ($BCFN) says eat crap SEC!!!! Can't touch Canada with ur wuss ass Civil Suits and fees. Losers! That's why Canadians are buyin stock the US brokers scared of SEC aren't allowing Americans to buy but hey I'm happy for Canada. The SEC is a Commission.

"Ethereum ""Triple Halving"" -- $150K per ETH at peak speculation (Jan 2023)","The irony of this sub is that I was given a 30-day ban on WSB for commenting ""HODL"" on a post long ago. But, look how the tables have turned; now tradFi-cucks suddenly have their own sub dedicated to crypto. Sad!

As more finance folks transition into including crypto into their portfolio, I always get asked, ""I'm looking for the next coin that will 100x"". Well, no shit-- so is everybody.

In all likelihood-- the only coins that will 100x are the coins that have already been backed by prominent Crypto VC's with a large token allocation already dedicated to the VC. Thus, the VC's are the only ones who'll make the 100x, **NOT YOU!** By the time they shill you the coin on Twitter, or it's hit an exchange, the insiders have already made 30-40x their initial investment. The 100x return for VC's finally comes when retail ape in. Know this and use it to your advantage.

This post informs the young and dumb about a detailed 77-page report and 1-page summary by an anonymous crypto analyst - SquishChaos, that went viral on Twitter back in April detailing how Ether will shoot up to $100K + by 2023.

In the report, he laid out a very well-reasoned and logical case on how the combination of EIP-1559 + ETH 2.0 merge would trigger a (90% reduction in issuance) equivalent to 3 consecutive Bitcoin Halving events.

**Consequently causing a supply shock that would trigger a peak mania price of $150K per ETH by Jan 2023.**

The bot keeps removed my post with the link to the report-- but just google ""Squishchaos triple halving"" if you're interested in reading the full 77-page report or 1-page summary.

Security layers: or qualifying security & decentralization,"A lot of my content is about revolutionary execution layers — and I couldn’t be more excited for StarkNet and zkSync 2.0. The smart contract industry will be ready for global scale adoption within the next year or so thanks to smart contract volitions. 

But I’ve run out of things to say about them, and I realized I have never really addressed what makes a security layer tick. Just to clarify, I’m just talking about security and verification — not data availability here. It’s all about a highly secure, widely decentralized, battle-tested and resilient layer for rollups, volitions and validiums (and whatever future innovations execution-exclusive layers bring) to settle on. The chief reason I haven’t talked about it is because it’s a very boring space with only two projects even focusing on these — all other monolithic chains are focused on execution while sacrificing various degrees of security and decentralization. This is a more opinionated piece than usual, because security and decentralization are hard to quantify. So, here, I’ll try to qualify them. It’ll be by order of importance. 

# A culture of users verifying

The single most important thing (in my opinion, just like everything else here) is a culture of end users, developers, wallets, exchanges, infrastructure providers, and other ecosystem participants running non-validating full nodes.

There are multiple ways this can be done: 

* First of all, stay within limits — prioritize the ease of running nodes over scalability. 
* Efficient clients with better ways to sync and store data. 
* Cryptographic solutions like statelessness and state expiry. 

Currently, Bitcoin remains the easiest major network to verify — anyone can run a node on a modern laptop. Ethereum is right on the ragged edge, though it’s possible with some smart hardware choices (i.e. focus on SSD). The culture remains and statelessness & state expiry are top priorities that’d make Ethereum the top contender when it comes to ease of running nodes. In the short term, we’ll get efficient light clients post-Merge for some relief. These are the only two projects I’m aware of focused on security & decentralization. 

I’ll explain later why this is so crucial — but make no mistake — if a network doesn’t let users run their own nodes, it’s not a permissionless network. You’re just replacing governments and bankers with a limited validator set. 

# A wide token distribution

Particularly for proof-of-stake networks, a wide token distribution is absolutely critical. Currently, I don’t think any network’s token distribution is sufficiently decentralized, though once again bitcoin and ether are leagues ahead, with litecoin a very distant third. Some of the newer projects like Solana or Avalanche are laughably centralized — I’d rather trust a reputable bank. Now, some may argue that they’ll eventually be decentralized, but there’s no actual method to decentralize. Indeed, their delegated-style consensus mechanisms with staking rewards actively disincentivize it. The larger the number and diversity of participants around the world, the more resilient the network will be. 

Long term, as Ethereum shifts to proof-of-stake, Bitcoin has the best mechanisms to achieve wide decentralization. 

These are the two most critical components to a security layer. If you don’t tick off these two boxes, you’re immediately disqualified. The next few points are also important, but not critical: 

# Economic security

While this can be quantified, as Justin Drake discusses in his must-watch Bankless Trilogy, it’s trickier than it first appears. For now, we could define this as the cost to attack a network. For proof-of-work networks, it’s all about how much it’ll cost you to acquire 51% hashpower. This could be through renting hashpower, acquiring ASICs etc. This could also be estimated from the going rates for renting hashpower and multiplying it by hashrate required for 51%. This is a hypothetical extrapolation, but according to crypto51.app, currently Ethereum is #1, Bitcoin #2, and everything else a country mile behind. Of course, you can’t actually do this, and the real costs are hard to figure out. For proof-of-stake, this becomes complicated very quickly due to the many differences and nuances with consensus mechanisms. Speaking of…

# Secure consensus mechanisms

Unpopular opinion, but I believe the consensus mechanism is the least important aspect to a security chain. It’s much more important to accomplish a culture of users verifying and a wide token distribution first. The nuances of consensus mechanisms become irrelevant if those criteria are not met. 

This is because validators provide a service to the network — it’s the users running nodes that get to enforce consensus rules. If you have a large base of users verifying, it becomes a significant deterrent to validators, and even if there’s an attack it’s guaranteed to be thwarted or worst case short-lived. 

But the nuances of consensus mechanisms do matter. For example, a non-delegation consensus mechanism like Ethereum or Algorand has superior properties to one with in-protocol delegation where validators are plutocratically elected. This is a dystopian view where the whales will dictate the security of the network, while apathetic stakeholders couldn’t care less — they just want the staking rewards, or more accurately, the “pre-bribes”. Of course, if the token distribution was adequately decentralized, it’s not much of an issue — once again pointing out that the wide token distribution is actually what’s critical. Now, of course, one would argue that delegation pools will be built on top of non-delegated “true” proof-of-stake anyway, but even these have superior properties. For example, Rocket Pool and SSV have automated, randomized systems which sidestep the plutocratic election entirely and eliminate the bribery and cabalization attack vectors of a delegated-type mechanism. Finally, the option to run a validator permissionlessly without canvassing delegation/permission from whales is priceless. 

There are many other nuances to consider: For example, typical BFT delegated-type consensus mechanisms shut down with a 33% attack, while the Beacon Chain or proof-of-work chains can remain live till 50%; slashing/blacklisting act as deterrents and enable a more graceful recovery from most attacks; secret leaders; fast finality etc. Finally, there’s the strength of the community in social coordination and recover in the edge scenario of a successful attack. 

I have wasted a lot of words here to say — there’s a lot to consensus mechanisms, but these nuances are not that important. Even a substandard delegated-style consensus mechanism with only 1,000 validators will be acceptable if it has millions of users verifying and the token is distributed among a billion participants. 

There are two other things that are just as important, but don’t really fit in the above schema. 

# Lindy and network effects, decentralized development, ecosystem support 

A battle-tested, resilient network with a token with strong monetary premium and thousands of developers building are desirable characteristics for a security chain. Once again, Bitcoin reigns, but Ethereum is catching up. In one aspect — developer adoption, multi-client development — Ethereum is far ahead of any other network. A multi-client network is significantly more resilient than a single-client network with one team building the only client. Of course, it could be argued that instead of distributing human resources to multiple clients it may be better to build one perfect client.

# ZKP friendly

If you have considered everything I have discussed here, you’d come away with the conclusion that there are only two competitive security chains in the blockchain industry — Bitcoin & Ethereum. Unfortunately, this is where Bitcoin is totally useless as it doesn’t have the functionality to verify zero-knowledge proofs. No one’s even talking about it, whereas for me it’s the no-brainer, most impactful upgrade Bitcoin can make, far more so than Taproot. 

Ethereum does have the capability to verify zk-SN(T)ARKs. EIP-1679 certainly helped, but the EVM is still very unfriendly to ZKP verification. Now, I’m not knowledgeable enough about ZKP cryptography to don’t understand the details, but certain precompiles would make things much easier for zkRs, validiums and volitions to settle on Ethereum — especially STARKs. Fortunately, execution layer developers like Matter Labs, Aztec and StarkWare have proven to be incredibly inventive, very effectively circumventing the EVM limitations. But there’s room for improvement for maximum efficiency, and I hope core researchers and developers implement the relevant precompiles and opcodes required after The Merge is done as Ethereum becomes increasingly rollup-centric. Of course, I understand the semi-ossified nature of the EVM makes it difficult to implement major changes — a showerthought I have is building a new VM with its own shard from scratch that’s dedicated to ZKP verification. (Through realistically, the execution layer side will focus on withdrawals, post-Merge cleanup and statelessness first.)

# Bonus benefit: massive data availability layer

An untold bonanza offered by a competent security layer is the possibility of also featuring a massive data availability layer. Ethereum, for example, is starting off with 64 data shards, scaling up to 1,024 data shards over the years, and with Moore’s Law and Nielsen’s Law possibly scaling up to several GBs/s of data availability. This sort of mind-bending data availability will never be possible with a centralized monolithic blockchain, effectively inverting the blockchain trilemma. I speculate that rollups can scale up to 15 million TPS by the end of the decade, and even more with alternate data availability solutions. 

# Concluding

Regrettably, there’s a deafening lack of competition in the security layer space. It’s basically just Ethereum right now, while monolithic blockchains are still focused on execution and scalability. I’d love to see some new projects emerge to tackle the security layer challenge. I have no idea how it can be done, though! The best option seems to be Bitcoin adding functionality to verify ZKPs, but a dark horse may be a global consortium with tech giants releasing a security layer whilst distributing tokens to billions of people. There could also be a revolutionary new security mechanism that obsoletes proof-of-stake. Just thinking out loud - all of these seem far-fetched. ",95.0,2021-09-23 07:24:20,0.99

**Frequently Asked Questions**

**Where's the best place to buy ETH?**

There are many centralized exchanges that support Ethereum. If you live in the US, the most popular exchanges are Coinbase, Gemeni and Kraken. Coinbase users can use Coinbase Pro for lower fees.

**When is Eth2 launching?**

Eth2 is a marketing term used to represent a number of updates to Ethereum. The Eth2 proof-of-stake chain first launched in December 2020. ""The Merge"", which is the event that will fully switch Ethereum's consensus to proof-of-stake, is estimated to be ready in early 2022, although there is no exact timeline. Other updates, such as data shards, will follow that update.

Visit [ethmerge.com](https://ethmerge.com/) to learn more about ""The Merge"".

**Do I need to do anything to update to Eth2? Will Eth2 create a new token?**

No, ETH holders *never* need to take any action to keep holding ETH. Ethereum users will be unaffected by the Eth2 upgrade. And the Eth2 updates will not create any new tokens.

**How can I stake my ETH?**

There are two ways that you can stake your ETH: by running your own validator, or providing your ETH to a staking pool.

* Running your own validator requires a modern computer and 32 ETH. Visit /r/ethstaker for more details
* Staking pools accept any amount of ETH. We recommend [Lido](https://lido.fi/) or [StakeWise](https://stakewise.io/)

**Why are Ethereum transaction fees so high?**

Like most blockchains, Ethereum fees are determined by supply-and-demand. The large demand to use Ethereum has pushed transaction fees quite high (however, fees were just a few cents only 2 years ago). Fees are especially high during market volatility, and during NFT drops.

**What is being done to lower Ethereum transaction fees?**

Ethereum fees are reduced by using layer-2 rollups. Rollups are scaling solutions that allow for significantly cheaper transactions, while still maintaining Ethereum's security.

Additionally, Eth2's data shards will make rollups even cheaper.

While rollups are cutting-edge technology being actively developed, a number are already live on Ethereum mainnet. Visit [l2beat.com](https://l2beat.com/) to learn more about rollups.

**What's the best wallet for Ethereum?**

The most popular tool for using decentralized applications is Metamask. However, for security reasons, we recommend using a hardware wallet such as a Trezor or Ledger.

"Here is what ""Ethereum 2.0"" actually is","There is a lot of confusion and outdated info surrounding Ethereum's future upgrades, often called Eth 2.0.  So I thought I'd summarize the plans and current status in the most simple yet informative way I can:

**There are three main steps for upgrading the level 1 Ethereum chain.**

- The beacon chain: This is basically the future Ethereum chain running on Proof of Stake instead of mining like bitcoin. It is already released, but not fully operational (you can stake but you cannot withdraw/transfer funds).

- The merge: This is when the beacon chain becomes fully operational, and the old mining chain is shut down and everything is transferred to proof of stake. This is currently scheduled for early next year.

- Data sharding: This will essentially ""split"" the data stored on the main Ethereum network into several pieces behind the scenes. This will increase the capacity of the chain by sharing the load between validators. This is currently scheduled for late next year. 

**However, data sharding alone is not enough to make the chain capacity fully future-proof.** There was originally plans for sharding code execution as well, which might have done the trick, but this has largely been put on hold, because there is a simpler solution. What is that solution? **Rollups.** These are techniques to move transactions off the chain, but in a completely trustless way. Such transactions will not depend on a sidechain that can be exploited or fail, and users always have the possibility of manually withdrawing funds back to the main Ethereum chain without depending on third parties to facilitate that withdrawal.
Rollups are already starting to appear, the biggest name so far is Arbitrum. However, this is a very gradual process. There are many types of rollups and different levels of decentralization and infrastructure that must be developed. And then dapps and users need to actually move over and use such rollups by default rather than the main chain. So although basic rollups is already usable, it will likely take years before the potential is fully realized. So it is not possible to point to a hard date for this, like we could for the level 1 upgrades.",28.0,2021-09-19 08:39:57,0.84

"I created an Open-Source Ethereum Miner For Xbox One, Series S, and Series X. AMA","Hi, I recently created an open-source Ethereum miner for Xbox. You can look at it here:

[https://github.com/kgrossnickle/eth-box](https://github.com/kgrossnickle/eth-box)

I know what you're thinking-- and yes, this is for real and --not a scam-- !! I have a background in software engineering and masters in statistics and used that knowledge in the fun world of open-source crypto and Etherum :P 

Unfortunately, it only gets around 3 MH/s on my Xbox Series S right now. BUT with the help of the open-source community, I think it is possible to reach around 15 MH/s on the series S (possibly higher) and 30 MH/s on the series X.  No idea on the Xbox One.

Also as of right now, I haven't made it available to mine without building from source (AKA doing super nerdy software stuff to run the miner). If people help me increase the MH/s to make this really usable as a miner, I'll create a downloadable, easy to install Xbox miner. 

I made this as a Proof of Concept to get around all the hardware (Xbox, PS5 etc.) that is not user-configurable and is actively anti-crypto. Since the POC is done, I don't have major plans on making the miner better and easy to use, but I did put my ether wallet up on the github page. If I get donations I'll spend some time making it better. I've already put \~200 hours in this so I'm kinda done ATM so I would need some motivation to keep working on it lol. However, I will merge good PRs etc from open source community regardless <3

If you like this idea, please please give it a star on Github so we can increase visibility. And if you are a developer  (especially HLSL shader developers!!!), please take a look at the code, make a PR and make this miner feasible.

"Rocket Pool mainnet launch date announced for October 6th! An overview of the Rocket Pool protocol and the importance of decentralised staking pools in maintaining the health, security, and decentralisation of Ethereum.","# TLDR;

Rocket Pool has just announced it’s mainnet launch date for October 6th! Permissionless, fully decentralised, and non-custodial liquid staking will be possible on Ethereum with as little as 0.01 ETH. Rocket Pool allows for a large network of node operators around the world, with no single centralised points of failure. Stakers and node operators maintain custody of their funds, and withdrawals are smart contract enforced, so there is no need to trust a third party with your ETH or the withdrawal keys.

We have seen there is enormous demand for staking pools that allow you to stake with less than 32 ETH. A decentralised staking pool like Rocket Pool is integral to the health, decentralisation, and security of the overall network, because without this option, we will likely see continued concentration of staked ETH on centralised competitors. Whilst it is extremely important in its contribution to the ongoing decentralisation of Ethereum, it should also be noted that Rocket Pool is designed to allow stakers and node operators to maximise their returns, allowing for greater opportunities and staking yields.

# Who can stake ETH using Rocket Pool?

In Rocket Pool, there are two types of users.

\- “Stakers” are able to stake any amount, with as little as 0.01 ETH. In a super simple 1-click process, with the ability to keep funds on your hardware (or any other) wallet the entire time, they can deposit ETH and receive rETH (staked ETH on Rocket Pool) in return. The value of rETH = ETH + staking rewards. It will become more valuable than ETH over time, as staking rewards accrue.

\- “Node operators” with at least 16 ETH, and 1.6 ETH worth of RPL as insurance collateral, plus the appropriate hardware and technical knowledge, can run a node on the Rocket Pool network (I will note that although there is a learning curve to becoming a node operator, Rocket Pool simplifies this process in comparison to solo staking, and you can practice on the Prater testnet before committing to this responsibility on mainnet). Node operators perform all the same duties as a normal 32 ETH staking validator on Ethereum, with the difference being that in Rocket Pool, it will be made up of 16 ETH of their own personal funds, matched with 16 ETH from the rETH staking pool, before being staked on Ethereum.

&#x200B;

# What does this mean and why should I care?

It is the first permissionless, fully decentralised, open source, and non-custodial, liquid staking pool on Ethereum. That's a lot of buzz words! They are important though. These principles are fundamental to maintaining the ethos and security of Ethereum itself, the health of the Ethereum network, and to protect stakers from the inherent risks of centralisation. There are other staking options available on centralised exchanges and liquid staking providers, however, these are not permissionless and decentralised. For those who are profit maximalists, it will also be possible to earn higher returns in Rocket Pool.

&#x200B;

*“Permissionless” and “fully decentralised”*

\- In the Rocket Pool network, **anybody with the required amount of ETH and RPL can be a node operator**, the Rocket Pool team doesn’t choose or give permission to a select few operators, which allows for a large, *decentralised* network of node operators all around the world. Rocket Pool supports all four ETH2 clients (Lighthouse, Prsym, Nimbus, and Teku), and selection of which client a node operator chooses is random by default, encouraging diversity and decentralisation amongst ETH2 clients. This means **there isn’t a single point of failure** for this network of validators, which mitigates risk for Rocket Pool stakers, and also protects the health and resilience of the Ethereum network.

\- By comparison, centralised exchanges are some of the single biggest staking entities on Ethereum, and if they had an intentional or unintentional fault in their centralised systems, it could mean a large portion of validators across the Ethereum network could all go down simultaneously. In this example, it represents a *single point of failure*. Some centralised exchanges may decentralise their design to some degree, e.g by using multiple staking operators, however the end result still remains heavily centralised.

\- Similarly, other liquid staking competitors are also largely centralised in design, with *a small set of permissioned node operators* that they select to participate in their network. Whilst this is in an improvement vs a centralised exchange, which improves the relative health of the network, it is still essentially centralised and vulnerable in this way. In contrast, Rocket Pool will allow for a large, decentralised network of node operators all over the world.

&#x200B;

*“Non-custodial”, or “not your keys, not your crypto”*

\- **rETH holders can stake whilst maintaining custody of their own funds** and simply storing rETH on their hardware wallet or other wallet of their choice.

\- **Withdrawals by node operators are smart contract enforced**, there is no need for node operators to trust the Rocket Pool team or another third party with their withdrawal keys, and no need for rETH holders to trust the node operators to return their share of ETH back to the network – this process is built into the system.

&#x200B;

*“Liquid staking”*

\- **""Stakers"" holding rETH (staked ETH on Rocket Pool), will not have their ETH locked until withdrawals are enabled following the merge**. It will remain liquid, meaning they will be able to simply swap it back for ETH on the Rocket Pool website or on a decentralised exchange (their rETH will now be redeemable for the original amount of ETH + the accrued ETH staking rewards). The merge, also known as part of ETH 2.0, is when Ethereum will transition from proof-of-work, to a proof-of-stake consensus mechanism. You can read more about this at [https://ethmerge.com/](https://ethmerge.com/).

\- For those concerned about gas costs, you should also be able to trade rETH on a decentralised exchange on a layer 2 solution such as Arbitrum or Optimism, where gas costs will be cheap (for more information about current layer 2 adoption as it becomes more established, see [https://l2beat.com/](https://l2beat.com/))

&#x200B;

*“Higher returns”*

\- Following the merge to proof-of-stake, lucrative priority fees and MEV rewards will go to staking validators rather than miners, which is expected to considerably increase the Ethereum staking APY. **Rocket Pool has designed the protocol to fairly distribute these rewards to both ""stakers"" holding rETH, and ""node operators""**. It remains to be seen how other staking competitors will approach this, and whether they will similarly share this value to stakers on their platforms.

\- **""Node operators"" will earn a greater ROI staking ETH on a node inside the protocol vs outside of it**, due to earning the staking APY on their own ETH + a commission (approximately 10%) of the staking rewards on the matched 16 ETH that they are staking on behalf of rETH holders + RPL rewards based on the level of RPL insurance collateral they have provided (greater RPL insurance collateralisation = greater RPL rewards, and also more safety and security for the Rocket Pool protocol).

\- As mentioned, approximately 10% of the earned staking rewards from rETH holders will go to node operators as a commission for performing all the required staking duties on their behalf. This means **rETH holders keep approximately 90% of the staking rewards. It is much more competitive than other centralised exchange alternatives**, such as Coinbase which takes a fee of 25% of staking rewards (stakers keep 75% of their rewards), and Kraken which takes a fee of 15% of staking rewards (stakers keep 85% of their rewards).

\- ""Stakers"" in Rocket Pool will be able to store their staked ETH, or rETH, in their own wallet. This will allow for a range of opportunities to **earn further yield by utilising rETH in defi protocols** (e.g. by depositing rETH as collateral to take out a loan). rETH has been designed to be compatible in defi protocols. Importantly, the amount of rETH tokens you hold will remain the same over time, it will just increase in value relative to ETH as staking rewards accrue. This is a different design that achieves the same outcome of tracking and accruing rewards. Other liquid staking derivatives use a rebasing model, where rewards slowly drip in to your address over time and the number of staked ETH tokens you hold increases. The rebasing model can be problematic if it is incompatible for use within some defi protocols, as rewards are not easily attributable to the individual user when they are in a smart contract alongside a large pool of funds from various other users.

&#x200B;

This is a huge milestone for Rocket Pool, and a truly important development to maintain the decentralisation and security of the Ethereum network.

This means **rETH holders keep approximately 90% of the staking rewards. It is much more competitive than other centralised exchange alternatives**, such as Coinbase which takes a fee of 25% of staking rewards (stakers keep 75% of their rewards), and Kraken which takes a fee of 15% of staking rewards (stakers keep 85% of their rewards).

\- ""Stakers"" in Rocket Pool will be able to store their staked ETH, or rETH, in their own wallet. This will allow for a range of opportunities to **earn further yield by utilising rETH in defi protocols** (e.g. by depositing rETH as collateral to take out a loan). rETH has been designed to be compatible in defi protocols. Importantly, the amount of rETH tokens you hold will remain the same over time, it will just increase in value relative to ETH as staking rewards accrue. This is a different design that achieves the same outcome of tracking and accruing rewards. Other liquid staking derivatives use a rebasing model, where rewards slowly drip in to your address over time and the number of staked ETH tokens you hold increases. The rebasing model can be problematic if it is incompatible for use within some defi protocols, as rewards are not easily attributable to the individual user when they are in a smart contract alongside a large pool of funds from various other users.

&#x200B;

This is a huge milestone for Rocket Pool, and a truly important development to maintain the decentralisation and security of the Ethereum network.

# What is it?

Dogecoin is a cryptocurrency created in 2013, in Oregon. It was still the first stage of social media rise, and the internet community had been circulating a meme for some time depicting a Shiba Inu, a Japanese dog breed. From there, its creator Billy Markus, inspired to merge this interest in virtual currencies, which he was already mounting, gave life to a sort of crypto-meme, the Dogecoin.  In short, a joke, which nevertheless has been transformed, from year to year, into something real, serious and tangible. From a purely technical point of view, however, Dogecoin is a pure cryptocurrency that is used exclusively to make payments. In this sense, it is similar to Bitcoin, but deeply different, in logic and nature, from crypto such as Ethereum and Ripple, which put transactions in the background. Basically, therefore, Dogecoin allows you to buy goods or services with a decentralized, secure payment method with low commission costs.  There is no shortage of thorns, however. And the main one is related to the way in which tokens are mined. In fact, Dogecoin uses, like Bitcoin, a proof-of-work verification model, which essentially puts miners in competition with each other with enormous computing power used and enormous consumption of electricity. Talking about Dogecoin market movements, there is no doubt that a large part of the crypto rise is due to the ""social incontinence"" of Elon Musk, number one of Tesla and SpaceX, who for months has been trying to push his followers, with a flurry of tweets, to focus on the asset.  In fact, behind almost all the rises of the currency, for a year now, there has been a tweet of the tycoon. It is a fact, in any case, that Elon Musk has inextricably linked his name to that currency, and that, on the occasion of several interviews, he has spoken of Dogecoin as his favorite crypto.

# How does it work?

Dogecoins are generated by a process called mining. The mining process uses the computing power of the computer dedicating its software and hardware. The software processes and confirms the transactions in progress on the Dogecoin P2P network. To be able to confirm a new transaction, very complex mathematical calculations are required. In exchange for the transaction processing and confirmation service, new DOGEs are issued.  The Dogecoin network randomly generates and distributes a fixed amount of DOGE after each successful verified transaction. These Dogecoins are distributed to the clients who process the transactions. The miners also take care of the management and security of the Dogecoin network. Each time a purchase is made using Dogecoin, they verify that the DOGE spent are actually owned by the buyer and come from his Dogecoin wallet. The probability that the miner himself receives the reward for his work depends on the computing power he adds to the network.  The system that generates and controls the Dogecoins does not need a central body because it is the users who are part of it who make it safe in exchange for a profit proportionate to the control activity carried out.

# Where to store it?

The best hot wallets for Dogecoin are Multidoge, Dogecoin core, TrustWallet and Atomic Wallet. If you want more security, a cold storage like Ledger or Trezor is the right choice.

# Pros&Cons

\*DISCLAIMER\* These lists are subjective, it depends from person to person

**Pros**

1. Dogecoin allows fast and cheap transactions
2. Dogecoin has a devoted community
3. Many exchanges and online platforms support Dogecoin

**Cons**

1. Its development team is not as big as the cryptocurrency market titans
2. Dogecoin’s value is constantly fluctuating and difficult to predict. This statement is generally true for any cryptocurrency, but it’s particularly evident with Dogecoin
3. Dogecoin gained popularity primarily due to marketing moves, it didn’t offer anything unique or special in terms of technology. That makes this cryptocurrency very vulnerable as it vies for a prime place with more advanced, innovative competitors",33.0,2021-09-07 20:09:01,0.92

**Frequently Asked Questions**

**Where's the best place to buy ETH?**

There are many centralized exchanges that support Ethereum. If you live in the US, the most popular exchanges are Coinbase, Gemeni and Kraken. Coinbase users can use Coinbase Pro for lower fees.

**When is Eth2 launching?**

Eth2 is a marketing term used to represent a number of updates to Ethereum. The Eth2 proof-of-stake chain first launched in December 2020. ""The Merge"", which is the event that will fully switch Ethereum's consensus to proof-of-stake, is estimated to be ready in early 2022, although there is no exact timeline. Other updates, such as data shards, will follow that update.

Visit [ethmerge.com](https://ethmerge.com/) to learn more about ""The Merge"".

**Do I need to do anything to update to Eth2? Will Eth2 create a new token?**

No, ETH holders *never* need to take any action to keep holding ETH. Ethereum users will be unaffected by the Eth2 upgrade. And the Eth2 updates will not create any new tokens.

**How can I stake my ETH?**

There are two ways that you can stake your ETH: by running your own validator, or providing your ETH to a staking pool.

* Running your own validator requires a modern computer and 32 ETH. Visit /r/ethstaker for more details
* Staking pools accept any amount of ETH. We recommend [Lido](https://lido.fi/) or [StakeWise](https://stakewise.io/)

**Why are Ethereum transaction fees so high?**

Like most blockchains, Ethereum fees are determined by supply-and-demand. The large demand to use Ethereum has pushed transaction fees quite high (however, fees were just a few cents only 2 years ago). Fees are especially high during market volatility, and during NFT drops.

**What is being done to lower Ethereum transaction fees?**

Ethereum fees are reduced by using layer-2 rollups. Rollups are scaling solutions that allow for significantly cheaper transactions, while still maintaining Ethereum's security.

Additionally, Eth2's data shards will make rollups even cheaper.

While rollups are cutting-edge technology being actively developed, a number are already live on Ethereum mainnet. Visit [l2beat.com](https://l2beat.com/) to learn more about rollups.

**What's the best wallet for Ethereum?**

The most popular tool for using decentralized applications is Metamask. However, for security reasons, we recommend using a hardware wallet such as a Trezor or Ledger.

😺 $CATS - getting MEMEFI on a new level (Just launched! Working product! <900K market cap!) 😺,"Hard Facts

&#x200B;

\* $CATS (ERC-20) and CZATS (BSC) just launched

\* MemeFi with a working and fully audited product (THE CROSSING)

\* <900k Market Cap

\* Hype will start once adoption begins (next week!)

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

 😺 About MemeFi  😺

&#x200B;

The greatest feature of “meme coins” is the

irreplaceable power of community identity; but

the greatest shortcoming is the smoke-andmirrors

that holds so many of these communities

together. What is the true value of a token if the

token itself has no utility or value?

&#x200B;

Furthermore, the greatest feature of any

innovative, fundamentally-strong project is its

ground-breaking product; but the greatest

shortcoming is the limited extent to which the

real-world success of the project fundamentally

rewards the token-holder. Again: what is the true

value of a token if the token itself has no utility

or value?

&#x200B;

Satoshi Nakamoto solved the Byzantine Generals

Problem using proof-of-work, and Catoshi

Nakamoto is now following in his footsteps by

creating a game-changing pathway for

cryptocurrency projects to maximize token utility.

&#x200B;

 😺 Catoshi´s Mission  😺

&#x200B;

To add powerful utility to cryptocurrency projects while

rewarding $CATS holders with high annual percentage yield

(APY) farming and staking via our unique cross-chain bridge.

&#x200B;

 😺 The Catoshi Ecosystem (THE CROSSING)  😺

&#x200B;

Game-changing utility and innovation will soon merge in Catoshi’s cross-chain bridge, The

Crossing, which will allow $CATS tokens to be wrapped to the Binance Smart Chain (BSC) —

enabling low-cost transfers while A) allowing staking and high-APY farming via our partners

PADSwap, B) increasing token demand as supply is locked on BSC, and C) allowing those

who use the Binance Smart Chain to purchase $CATS away from the Ethereum blockchain.

&#x200B;

The Crossing will also provide a game-changing pathway for any other token (including

memes!) to cross from Ethereum to BSC, or from BSC to Ethereum — dramatically altering the

way Decentralized Finance operates by opening a host of new buyers and a range of new

utility for any cryptocurrency project that wishes to take advantage. 

&#x200B;

Through The Crossing, Catoshi will soon be making it simpler than ever for Ethereum-based projects to quickly,

smoothly, and easily provide token holders with high-APY farming and staking through our

close developmental partnership with the elite team at PADSwap.

&#x200B;

But not only that(!) — Catoshi will soon be providing bridges to other chains as well, making it

possible for any cryptocurrency token to dramatically expand both its territory and its utility,

with a smoother delivery mechanism than has ever been seen before.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

 😺 $CATS - The Catoshi Token  😺

&#x200B;

The original Catoshi, CATS was launched

on Ethereum with an initial supply of 21

million (designed to match the supply of

BTC), with its own twist on the classic RFI

code — rewriting the code from scratch

to include a 6% tax (3% redistribution to

holders, 2% burn, and 1% to a charity

wallet), so that our holders are maximally

rewarded for holding. 

&#x200B;

Due to the 2% burn, the already-low supply of CATS is

steadily decreasing; and due to the 3%

redistribution, holders are able to watch

their own holdings continually grow.

&#x200B;

With the release of The Crossing,

Catoshi tokens will be wrapped to the

Binance Smart Chain where they will

become CZatoshi(!).

&#x200B;

CZatoshi will trade exclusively on

PADSwap’s pioneering platform, with

opportunities available for holders to

further benefit from $CATS through

high-APY farming and staking, as even more of the supply is locked.

&#x200B;

 😺 The team 😺

&#x200B;

One of the biggest advantages our project has is the strength and

unwavering belief of our core Catoshi team.

&#x200B;

The Catoshi team is made up of 12 core team members, holding roles across

strategy, product, development, marketing, and communications. With a

combined 50 years of experience across cryptocurrency, blockchain, and

payments, we have powerhouse personnel that allows us to deliver groundbreaking,

game-changing utility to the crypto “MemeFi” world.

"“Ethereum is Useless and will Die because of Insanely High Gas Fees!” Is this you? Here is a Guide: How to Move your Ethereum/ERC-20 to Layer 2/Sidechain and do Transactions costing LESS <$0,01 taking 1-2 seconds!","Understandably most people new to this space and Ethereum, are **raging** and fearful with the current gas fees (transaction fees), having sky-rocketed lately. Yes, we are frequently seeing 100 – 300 gwei resulting in **50-150 dollar prices on Ethereum's Mainnet (Layer 1) at rush hour!**

**This post will help you out!**

1. Mainnet: **Why are the gas fees high?**
2. Mainnet: **How can I pay the LEAST POSSIBLE on Ethereum Mainnet?**
3. How solve this problem, by **moving from Ethereum’s Mainnet** to Layer 2’s (L2), Side Chains or Helper Chains that most “veterans” have been using for DeFI and transactions for months. Examples are: **Polygon, Fantom, xDAI, Optimism and soon Arbitrum**. (Polygon and Fantom not being ""true
4.  The **Layer 2 Rollups** will **Scale Ethereum** to new heights 

**REPOST FROM YESTERDAY:** The previous [Original Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/phcroe/ethereum_is_useless_and_will_die_because_of/) from yesterday and the repost was automatically removed by ModBot. Many msg me to repost, so here it is. Hopefully it stays up!

# 1) Why are the gas fees high?

* Right now, Ethereum can handle about **30 transactions per second (TPS**) at best; Visa, by contrast, does about 1,700 transactions per second and claims it can handle up to 24,000.
* Currently, due to the massive usage (**success/adoption**) of Ethereum being used for DeFI, NTFs mints (crazy shit), transactions by retails, institutions and exchanges the gas fees are rocketing in periods.
* This is bad for us “small fish”, leading to fees higher than some of us have in our wallet! However, this proves that Ethereum still is working securely even under pressure without mistakes. For sure, Ethereum needs to continue to prove that blockchain and smart-contracts are secure and decentralized, in order for adoption, acknowledgment and success of the rest of the crypto space with so **fantastic projects like ADA, ALGO, AVAX, Elrond, Tezos and ONE** etc. can thrive.
* While we wait for ETH 2.0’s Sharding and the current L2 Rollups to take over (see below), we have to look at other tricks and solutions. Besides, I suspect the completion/integration of Sharding to take longer than expected.

# 2) How can I pay the least possible gas on Ethereum Mainnet?

* Use a [Gas Tracker](https://etherscan.io/gastracker) to see the current estimated gas price for a **fast, average or slow transaction,** BEFORE transacting. If you are using e.g. [Metamask](https://metamask.io/), you can **Edit Gas Price** if it is set too high or if you believe it will drop. **Careful:** *If you set it too low*, there is a risk it wont go through, and you got to pay MORE to speed it up.
* In my experience the **gas is LOWEST in the mornings at 6-10 UTC (US night time)**, or especially in **Weekends.**
* If your transaction is not urgent, **WAIT** for the time when it drops back to **GOAL OF 15-35 gwei**! Not many weeks ago it was consistently 7-15 gwei in low traffic hours.

# 3) Make the move from Ethereum Mainnet (Layer 1) to a Layer 2 or Sidechain:

**USEFUL INFO:**

* [Layer 2/Rollups](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/scaling/layer-2-rollups/)**:** Is a collective term for solutions designed to help scale Ethereum by handling transactions off the Ethereum Mainnet (Layer 1), while taking advantage of the robust security of Mainnet.
* [Sidechains:](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/scaling/sidechains/) A sidechain is a separate blockchain which runs in parallel to Ethereum Mainnet and operates independently.
* **EDIT:** Doing this primarily for those who wanna use DeFi/dApps! No reason to move if you have just wanna HODL your Eth or keep them in a ""earn"" wallet like Celcius, Blockfi, Nexo or crypto . com.
* Moving to the currently most used solution, **Polygon (MATIC),** will for many be like **being born anew** (seriously, [here is my reaction/post](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/mxrw09/i_just_tried_maticpolygon_l2_for_ethereum_why_did/) 4 months ago). Transactions **cost average $0.0007** and **takes 1-3 seconds** (unless rush hour). Yes, this is already a lot cheaper than almost all L1 competitors.
* Polygon currently already has most big DeFi dApps like **[Opensea](https://support.opensea.io/hc/en-us/articles/1500012889322-How-do-I-purchase-NFTs-on-Polygon-) (free trading of NFTs), Sushiswap, 1inch, AAVE, Curve, Beefy**. And many more are integrating.
* Polygons biggest DEX is [Quickswap](https://quickswap.exchange/#/swap), it's based on Uniswap V2. It has 1 Billion TVL and 24 h volume +/- 100 million. In other words: Great liquidity!
* [Coinbase and other Exchanges are integrating Polygon](https://www.fxstreet.com/cryptocurrencies/news/coinbase-to-use-polygons-ethereum-scaling-solution-to-reduce-prices-settlement-times-202109010427), so, you soon you can deposit DIRECTLY into e.g. Polygon, and Withdraw directly without having to touch L1's high fee baselayer!
* Another great choice is **Fantom (FTM),** while being it’s own blockchain is compatible with EVM and can be regarded as a helper chain.

**HOW TO:**

* For simplicity, we will focus on Polygon. In order to move to or from Polygon, you need to use this [Bridge](https://wallet.matic.network/bridge/) (there are loads of other bridges too, e.g. between BSC or Fantom).
* I personally connect with [Metamask](https://metamask.io/) (signing all transactions with my hardware wallet [Ledger](https://www.ledger.com/)/[Trezor](https://trezor.io/)for security!) or Coinbase wallet to interact with Bridges and dApps. You can easily add different networks ([handy link to do it automatic](https://chainlist.org/)) supporting the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) and seamlessly swap between them in your Metamask, after you’ve added them.
* If you use bridge when **we're at 15-25 gwei,** I recon moving e.g. Eth costs like **$3-5 for permission**, then **$7-10 for Transfer.** With current gas prices it's surely >**$**100!

&#x200B;

[Pretty easy to use.](https://preview.redd.it/iijnvxf6uil71.png?width=1917&format=png&auto=webp&s=4b8781401125348fd9808baee844b21b563c6f3f)

1. Chose what and where you want to transfer, and... click transfer.
2. From Ethereum L1 to Polygon, you **first need to pay a 1 time ""permission to use"" transaction** for **each new coin** (it gives permission to the bridge smart contract to use your selected token e.g. Eth, AAVE, LINK). This is cheaper than the actual transfer.
3. When the first transaction is done, you will get prompted to do the **actual Transfer** (higher price). Again, wait until gas fees are low to start the Bride-process, but when it's done you're FREE.
4. Once your crypto arrives at Polygon, **you automatically get some free MATIC that lasts many transactions** (Cant remember, it's 0.01?). You can also use a [faucet](https://matic.supply/) if you run out of gas. I typically just buy 1 MATIC for all my accounts, which will hold for probably 1000 transactions.

# 4) The Layer 2 Rollups will Scale Ethereum to new heights

* Ethereum 2.0 will in the future have it’s **sharding, however I believe the the current working and coming L2/Rollups** will easily scale to >100,000 TPS. Heck even 1 of the current Rollups alone has far better TPS than many of the current L1-competitors!
* There are 3 types of rollups. **ZK-rollups** (Zero Knowledge rollups), **Optimistic rollups** and **Hybrids.**
* **ZK-rollups** bundle or ""roll up"" hundreds of transfers off-chain and generates a cryptographic proof, known as a SNARK (succinct non-interactive argument of knowledge). This is known as a validity proof and is posted on layer 1. Examples of Rollups being built are: **Loopring, Starkware, Matter Labs zkSync, Aztec 2.0, Hermez network** (merged with Polygon), **zkTube**
* **Optimistic rollups** sit in parallel to the main Ethereum chain on layer 2. They can offer improvements in scalability because they don't do any computation by default. Instead, after a transaction they propose the new state to Mainnet, or ""notarise"" the transaction. With Optimistic rollups, transactions are written to the main Ethereum chain as calldata, optimising them further by reducing the gas cost. Examples are: **Optimism** (Live!), **Arbitrum** (Live!)**, Fuel Network, Cartesi and OMGX.**
* In some years **Ethereum will be a beast,** a platform hosting the web3 as a base later, having multiple L2 rollups, sidechains, helper-chains working on top of it, in addition to **Sharding**, making it able to host the necessary thousands or millions of TPS needed for mass adoption.

Ethereum Network Security Leading Up To The Merge,"(Originally written as a comment on the Daily thread but i would like some more discussion on this topic so I'm republishing it as a post. If this is frowned on or against the rules please downvote and report.)

I've been thinking about network security in terms of hashpower leading up to the Merge and i think there is a possible attack vector.

First some background:

ETH completely dominates by a factor of 2600% bigger than the next profitable coin with the highest GPU-mineable hashpower which is ETC. (675 TH/s vs 25 TH/s).

I'm going to assume that with the release of the Antminer E9 and the current trajectory Ethereum hashrate will hit 700 TH/s +. The existing argument that miners will move to other coins is wrong because the other GPU mineable coins are so small compared to ETH that an influx of 700 TH/s will either serve to a) 51% attack ALL of them or b) tank profitability to lower than cents per day on ALL the other coins.

Considering even ETC outhashes all the other coins combined i would say we have a very serious problem.

The rest of the PoW ecosystem can only handle about 200 TH/s of additional influx (napkin math) this leaves 500 TH/s worth of GPUs that will realize they have nothing to mine a month before the Merge when i assume mining power will start to be diverted to the other PoW algorithms.

When taking into account the high prices GPUs command in this current market there will be a massive incentive to sell those GPUs at current high prices rather than mine for an additional month when they will be obsoleted. I forsee that there will be a massive dump of at least close to 8.6 million used GPUs(500 TH/s % RTX 3070 hashrate)which is near an entire fiscal quarters worth of current gen product.

Since ASICs are algorithm specific and can't be used elsewhere, when ETH PoW ends all those ASICs will move to Ethash chains and destroy their profitability taking them out of the equation which will compound this effect.

This brings us to the actual problem. With the PoW securing a 460B$ marketcap blockchain having an incentive to exit as fast as possible to take advantage of market prices, IMO Ethereum will be at its weakest relative to the value secured it has ever been, especially with a bull market in full force. This will be the last opportunity for malicious actors to wreak havoc on what is the backbone of Web 3.0.

I would like to hear your thoughts and counter arguments.

TLDR: I expect PoW shenanigans around the Merge. Shorting $NVIDIA to hell.

3 Beginner Tips to save gas on Ethereum,"Many people complain or make fun of ETH's gas fees. There are ways to save significant amounts of gas on Ethereum though, while we wait for Merge/sharding to make things better.

# 1) Use L2s/ Sidechains

This is the biggest gas saver. Examples of Sidechains include xDai and Polygon. The fees there are literally fractions of a cent. You can make thousands of transactions there with less than a dollar.

Almost anything you can do on Ethereum Mainnet, you can do on a sidechain. Polygon, in particular, has most of the DeFi DApps there (Aave, Curve, Sushiswap, and more are all on Polygon).

# 2) Monitor gas price, and do transactions on Mainnet when gas price is low

One site where one can track gas price is Etherscan: [https://etherscan.io/gastracker](https://etherscan.io/gastracker)

For example, currently gas price is a whopping 200 Gwei. Unless you are in a hurry, delay your transactions to a better time when gas price is low (US night time or weekends).

# 3) Batch your transactions on Mainnet

A feature of Ethereum is that gas price is independent of amount transferred/swapped. Transferring 0.1 ETH will cost the same as transferring 100 ETH.

So, rather than transferring 10 times separately, see if you can batch your transactions into 1 single transfer. It will save a lot of gas this way.",22.0,2021-09-03 15:38:34,0.82
"It's clear that A LOT of people in this sub and in crypto don't understand Etherium, its plan to scale and where Etherium and layer 1s in general are headed.","Just today, I've seen two separate posts talking about how expensive the gas fees currently are on Eth. Yes this is a valid point of criticism, however when people start asking how eth is ""in the top 2"" when its literally the only chain with a fully functioning ecosystem and suggest that Ethereum can't and won't be scalable, that's when you realize a lot of people are either uninformed or are just spreading false information about where Ethereum is actually headed. 


The roadmap over the past few years now has changed Ethereum from a smart contract centric platform to possibly the only major rollup centric platform, which will enable much higher throughput. 


What does this mean? Pretty soon other blockchains won't be competing with Ethereum but with the likes of Arbitrum, Optimism and other rollups solutions coming to Ethereum.


If you're not familiar with rollups, they differ from sidechains like Polygon and without going into technicals and in keeping it brief, rollups will enable layer 1 blockchains like Ethereum and Cardano to scale in order to process thousands of transactions per second. 


Blockchains (L1s) that do not take advantage of rollups will be left behind in the dust. A layer 1 will never be able to out-scale a rollup that can concatenate thousands of transactions together, which means massive gas savings in the future.


The main advantage Ethereum has over every other chain is the massive validator count of over 200k validators staking on the beacon chain. This massive validator count is what is required to support all 1,024 data shards in a decentralized method which along with a proof of stake consensus model following the beacon chain's merge which will create an Eth ecosystem that will support blockchain interoperability through rollups, as well as scaling well into hundreds of thousands of transactions per second. Welcome to web 3.0.


Now going back to present day Ethereum. Arbitrum recently opened thier mainnet to the public. This is one of the first major rollups on Eth, an optimistic rollup which already has major defi players onboarding (Chainlink, Uniswap, Aave, Curve, Sushiswap) and more to come, along with the recently raised $150 million in funds for Arbitrum. Over the coming months, rollups will lift their TPS restrictions and most of the dapps on Eth will be on rollups, with Etherium providing the settlement layer and consensus security needed along with low gas fees.


Tldr; bullish on Ethereum, and Ethereum's rollup centric roadmap which will force other chains to compete with the likes of Arbitrum and Optimism and other rollups.

MARKET UPDATE: 10 Year T-Note 1.29% -0.00 Down -0.39%

The 'Big Short' Michael Burry will soon have to close out his TLT puts/expires worthless, or go further out in time only to continue losing money seeing all reds. LOL

Yields are going to stay lower and for much longer!!!

No economy in today's world can afford higher rates. NONE!

If rates head higher naturally due to supply and demand dynamics, it will be brought right back down artificially by Fed intervention. The Fed can also go out into the longer end of the yield curve. They have many tools at their disposal to combat higher interest rates. The Fed is keeping rates low to help finance America's twin deficits.

'QE forever' will probably still be ON despite the Fed tinkering with its taper plans by end of this year or early next.

Covid/Delta cases and new variants will cause the Fed to reassess their current position.

I say, QE continues unabated.

Short-term rates are expected to stay at or near zero way pass years 2022, 2023 and even out into 2025!

Inflation is truly transitory because of pandemic caused supply chain disruptions, and for a  longer term outlook, inflation will return to 2% or less due to demographic changes (population is aging fast) here in the US, and even in China!

Pandemic related stimulus and unemployment benefits will only last so long, and its obvious limits to the general population. What do ordinary people do when all the ""free money' dries up? Get back to work and/or scale back on spending!!!

We are already seeing signs of consumer confidence deteriorating, economy noticeably slowing into the end of the year. Watch this Friday's jobs report for confirmation. I'm betting hiring has slowed.

And with AI, automation, technology improvements with manufacturing etc, prices will continue to trend lower over time!

All the trillions and trillions of $ dollars in monetary and fiscal stimulus will find their way into the stock market, and even in cryptos like Ethereum!

So any market pullbacks/corrections will be mild, and bought right back UP!

'Buy the Dip' has worked since the 2008 financial crisis. Nothing has changed since then! QE is still on and zero/negative real interest rate will be with us into the foreseeable future.

In closing, the only real inflation you will see is in housing, healthcare and financial assets (including cryptos).

The Ethereum Triple Halving - Part 2,"Hello again everyone, around 1-2 weeks ago I made a post about the [Ethereum Triple Halving and why ETH will easily overtake BTC in market cap](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/p5m9eq/the_ethereum_triple_halving_and_why_eth_will/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3). The post did extremely well and a lot of you asked for a more in depth review of the two event major events (EIP-1559 and PoS) that are taking place. The original post was mostly just a surface level overview of what the ETH triple halving entails and some of the likely outcomes after the two events and comparing with BTC. The intention of this post is to clarify some of the details of the two major ETH updates: EIP-1599, and the transition from PoW to PoS, and discuss the economical side effects of the changing supply dynamic of ETH as a result of these two major events and why a $150,000 ETH isn't as unreasonable as you may first think.

Firstly, a disclaimer: The brains behind this whole ETH triple halving thesis is Nikhil Shamapant and the thesis can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1bECqgijhgjdS782AB620gFjK5qx-vA99/view). I highly recommend reading it if you want an even better understanding on the whole ETH triple halving.

Secondly, I want to clarify the two straight forward yet important terms mean as they will be helpful in understanding this post

**Total supply -** The total amount in existence. Bitcoin's total supply is 21M. A more traditional example to think of it is the total supply of crude oil is equal to the amount of crude oil underground + the amount of crude oil above ground.

**Circulating Supply -** The amount being bought and sold. Bitcoin’s circulating supply is \~85% of the 21M total cap, this is even lower if you consider HODLers as removing BTC from circulating supply. Analogously the circulating supply of crude oil refers to the crude oil above ground.

**BTC's Supply Dynamic**

As mentioned above, only 21M bitcoin will ever exist. Approximately 85% of that is already circulating. Miners mine more of this supply and the block reward dilutes the circulating supply but leaves total supply unchanged. Eventually, the circulating supply of Bitcoin will slowly approach the total supply. If we also consider the elite army of BTC HODLers, the people that only ever buy BTC and will never sell, this removes more of the circulating supply which to some degree will counteract the dilution of the issuance of BTC. If more Bitcoin is purchased and HODLd than the block reward sold by miners, circulating supply of Bitcoin could potentially decrease.

We could make the argument that the circulating supply determines the price not the total supply. If we look at crude oil production we see that when it surges the price goes down despite the fact that the total supply of crude oil remains the same. If this argument holds then BTC's block reward for mining acts as a net negative for price and the halving acts as a stimulus to increase price. Hodling also adds another dimension to this argument. As previously mentioned HODLers never sell and take away from the circulating supply. Analogous to this, If I were to hold a high percentage of the world's crude oil supply the demand for crude oil is placed on a smaller circulating supply thus squeezing prices even higher. Similarly HODL culture will also have a price impact on BTC.

&#x200B;

[Bitcoin supply over time](https://preview.redd.it/5qglormu7jk71.png?width=1039&format=png&auto=webp&s=203bb54756303031f4b030bd1770a75aa527ffe3)

**ETH's Supply Dynamic**

On the flipside, ETH's supply dynamic has big differences relative to BTC. Namely, ETH does not have a hard cap (yet). Due to there not being a hard capped supply with ETH, the block reward does not reduce with halving events like BTC does. In the case of ETH, the circulating supply equals the total supply. This means that similar to BTC, miner block rewards also dilute circulating supply. However, unlike BTC, ETH block rewards also dilute total supply. ETH has never gone through a halving event before, therefore, the net negative price effect as a result of the block reward dilution remains consistent. To add to this, the HODL culture is arguably much younger and less hardcore with ETH and is thus speculatively less likely to impact the price as much as for BTC.

**The Effect of EIP-1559 on ETH's Supply**

The first major event which has already taken place is the network upgrade to EIP-1559. The critical change with this update is how ETH as an asset changes. **As a result of EIP 1559, 70% of transaction fees on the Ethereum network will be burned.** Projections from Ethereum research Justin Drake predicts that Ethereum will be net deflationary, losing 2% of supply annually after accounting for the issuance of new ether to stakers. This is the ETH community deciding it wants to compete with BTC as a store of value. The main differences with BTC are:

* ETH's circulating supply is equal to the total supply which implies deflation decreases circulating supply to also decrease. With BTC, even though it has a hard cap its circulating supply is consistently increasing over time.
* ETH's hard cap will reduce after hitting its peak supply at approx. 120M. The supply will decrease around 2% annually.

If the idea that the circulating supply drives the price holds then a decreasing circulating supply of ETH is a very bullish prospect.

&#x200B;

[The supply reduced from about 115M to 85M from 2016 to 2021. It turns out that represents the same 30&#37; decline in issuance as we’ll see from EIP1559.](https://preview.redd.it/ngoyfjkv7jk71.png?width=1067&format=png&auto=webp&s=72d9adf7e46dc6251e90e8f1e5a55ed2feb21045)

**The Effect of Proof of Stake on ETH's Supply**

Currently ETH is in a PoW system just like BTC. In a nutshell PoW blockchain has miners securing the network and PoS blockchain has stakers securing the network. The result of this transition is that the efficiency of how the network is secured is greatly increased which has a knock on effect of requiring less issuance of ETH the achieve the same level of security. This event is significant because it will represent a drop in sell pressure equivalent to 2.5 BTC halvings.

After the transition from PoW to PoS ETH will have economically incentivized HODLing from the staking yield and DeFi yield. Right now 8% of ETH's circulating supply is locked in to DeFi and approx. 6% is being staked so in total 14% of ETH is locked out of circulating supply already.

&#x200B;

[Total amount of ETH locked into the DeFi space Aug 27th 2021.](https://preview.redd.it/u2zgos8w7jk71.png?width=1605&format=png&auto=webp&s=656ac2f87bce83273b8cb8434d09183a32ed81d1)

&#x200B;

[Staked ETH over the last week](https://preview.redd.it/oxptspww7jk71.png?width=1681&format=png&auto=webp&s=2a793e98e3f30b0bf5ca6d5f206f0e091a1934c0)

Now, taking a look at some of potential yield rewards after the merge we have several different cases. On one side the staking APR is 68.7% if only 4.5M ETH is staked (assuming there is no change in DeFi value this represents 12% of circulating supply being locked) compared to a 7.2% APR if 15M ETH is staked (this represents 20% of all ETH being locked up on top of the ETH locked into DeFi assuming it stays the same). We should also note that price isn't the relevant variable to see ETH staking yields moving. If you buy ETH at $2,000 you will get say a 25% yield; if ETH triples in price and a new investor comes and buy ETH for $6,000 they will still get a 25% staking yield until enough has been locked into staking for yields to move down. We must also note that there is in fact a validator queue. Not all ETH can be staked simultaneously there is a limit of approx. 900 new validators per day with each validator holding 32 ETH that's approx. 29,000 ETH that can be staked every day. The validator queues will likely be years long and is the reason we won't see 80%+ ETH being staked in the short term. With 80%+ ETH being staked there comes another positive security implication. If ETH and BTC both have a 1T market cap, the value of Bitcoin’s hash power is about $5B. If 80% of Ethereum is staked, the security of ETH at that market cap will be over $400B. That’s 80x the security of Bitcoin.

HODL culture is about to become economically enforced with ETH as investors will be paid a yield to keep their ETH out of circulating supply. The attractive staking yields will lead to huge sums of ETH being taken out of circulation leaving less ETH in circulation on top of the decreasing total supply will cause a **price squeeze**.

&#x200B;

[Justin Drakes estimated staking yields.](https://preview.redd.it/0upgb1vy7jk71.png?width=1827&format=png&auto=webp&s=d06c75eb5a53fd237ea553b36ac9c912448c7928)

You've probably seen many ETH price predictions usually ranging from **$10,000** to **$20,000**, but one thing to note about these predictions is that every price analysis on ETH essentially boils down to a comparison with BTC. A popularized approach is using the Stock to Flow (S2F) model as is used with gold and silver and applied to BTC. The ""Stock"" refers to the circulating supply where the ""Flow"" is the amount of new issuance. Every BTC halving the issuance rate drop in half and the S2F rises, using the model a price target of $288,000 was calculated as this cycle peak for BTC. Many analysts then take this price target and apply it to the ETH/BTC ratio which has ranged anywhere from 0.02 to 0.1 and this then gives us the commonly seen ETH price targets ranging anywhere between $5,700 to $28,000.

Now consider the fact that staking Ethereum could potentially unlock more than 5x the value for each Ether (the calculation for this number is discussed in the thesis on PG 61) on top of many other factors such as the changing supply dynamic, the huge demand for ETH, the utility it brings, then ETH reaching 6 digits seems a lot more reasonable. To add to this, if staking yields were to go below 1.81% APR it would equate to 83% (100M) of ETH being locked out of circulation which is not including the amount locked in the DeFi space so potentially upwards of 90% of ETH being locked in. With such a large amount of illiquidity the amount of money to actually raise the price of ETH is not on a 1:1 ratio in other words to a reach a market cap of $15T ($150,000 ETH) you wouldn't actually require 15 trillion dollars worth of ETH to be bought. So through the power of a price insensitive staking with high yields it will attract more staking which in turn leads to more illiquidity allowing for the price of ETH to go up more easily.

&#x200B;

[Staking economics taken fromEthHub.](https://preview.redd.it/fd7igl8z7jk71.png?width=1105&format=png&auto=webp&s=697ac6735b89fc4360f538139512ec80ca8cae55)

&#x200B;

""I believe the future could break the past as is often the case with disruptive technology"" Therefore, I don't think the price predictions make total sense from an investment stand point. The forecasts always rely heavily on analogizing from prior cycles and using BTC, but don't really consider the idea that the implementation of these major changes have never have happened before in crypto history so there is no way to analogize what these effects will do. I think these analogies can potentially break down due to the uniqueness of the attributes coming to ETH and how they change the supply dynamics of ETH. After the merge to proof of stake ETH will have a negative S2F and unlike BTC which is becoming increasingly scarce as it approaches a hard cap, its total circulating supply will decrease every year. It will not only be more scarce on an issuance basis, but be more scarce on a circulating supply basis than bitcoin each year.

TLDR: EIP-1559 and PoS significantly change the supply dynamics of ETH relative to BTC and it would thus be erroneous to use BTC price predictions and apply them to ETH as it is almost always done with ETH price predictions. EIP-1559 and PoS will account for a reduction in \~90% in sell pressure due to the deflationary tokenomics and huge monetary incentive to stake ETH which in turn gives more illiquidity, implies the price of ETH could reach up to $150,000 in a best case scenario.

**Introducing Vanity Token**

Vanity,  or $VNY, is a unique token that provides custom wallet addresses for  Bitcoin, Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain, Litecoin and Dogecoin  blockchains. Vanity generates customizable non-proxy addresses, visible  across blockchain explorers. 

Vanity was officially launched on *May 28th, 2021*. The final iteration of the contract got released on *Juli 19th.* The developer and founder are based out of Italy. 

Vanity’s  main goal is to simplify the experience of crypto users, who are often  confused by the intricacies of how wallets interact with different  blockchains.

$VNY is now available for purchase via [PancakeSwap](https://pancakeswap.finance/swap#/swap?outputCurrency=0xAbc69f2025bDb12efcdB8fd048d240fFf943ca82), which has locked the Vanity liquidity pool for a three-year period.

**Vanity Use Cases**

Vanity  seeks to improve the security of the blockchain sector by improving  trust in wallets. By allowing users to create customizable, recognizable  addresses, Vanity eliminates any confusion in regards to selecting the  proper address. 

The benefits of  these addresses include miners being able sort their rigs efficiently,  easy wallet identification, and the ability to create a personalized  address with unique phrasing.

Some  notable examples of Vanity addresses include 

 1**SaToShi**YPiWYEevVwxYG6hkDfAT9N9Fy, commemorative of the mysterious  creator of the Bitcoin, Satoshi Nakamoto, 

and  0x**C0FFEE**1268A4aAe653a4a9Ca81e183dCCAD1a029, referencing the favorite  morning drink of many people.

**Vanity Wallet Security**

Only  the requester of the customizable address has access to the private key  needed in order to generate the Vanity wallet address. Using the  customer’s public key, Vanity creates a partial private key which is  generated using high GPUs computing power. Upon receiving the partial  key, users will use the $VNY offline tool to merge the two keys  together. This creates a new key for the Vanity wallet address.

An audit by [Solidity Finance](https://solidity.finance/audits/Vanity/) has confirmed the security of the smart contract of the token.

**Other Features**

$VNY  Token offers frictionless fee redistribution, as well as automatic  liquidity provision for the Vanity liquidity pool. Deflationary measures  reduce the overall circulating supply, ensuring that Vanity maintains  its price point.

Vanity is also  developing a Non-Fungible-Token (NFT) marketplace that uses $VNY as its  currency. Vanity has outlined further details in their official  Litepaper, which can be found on their [website](https://vanitytoken.net/).

While  Vanity has not offered a complete future schedule to the public as of  now, the team has assured its community they have further plans beyond  custom wallet addresses. Interested users should keep an eye on the  social media handles of the company in order to learn of any new  products or features.

**Partnerships and coverage**

Vanity  has started to pop up on people's radars: Vanity founder Joseph  recently did an **AMA session with Blockcast**, which can be found [here](https://blockcast.cc/interviews/asia-blockchain-community-interviews-vanity-token-revolutionize-customize-get-your-unique-wallet/).

Why Tezos soon will be the biggest NFT Blockchain,"Ethereum is currently the biggest NFT blockchain by far, however as ETH still has problems, more and more people have been looking for other blockchains to mint and collect their NFT´s.

That has contributed to the rise of marketplaces like Hic et Nunc (HEN) on Tezos. In this post I argue for why Tezos might soon become the blockchain most popular for NFT´s. First lets take a look at existing NFT projects on Tezos and up coming NFT projects on Tezos.

&#x200B;

Hic et Nunc (HEN) - The single most popular NFT marketplace on Tezos. A single NFT recently got sold for over $150k.

Kalamint - Popular curated NFT marketplace on Tezos. Kalamint is partnering with leading Virtual Reality company Virtualware to merge NFT´s and virtual reality together. Kalamint is an awesome platform with a growing community. They are working on combining art and virtual reality.

[Objkt.com](https://Objkt.com) \- NFT markerplace on Tezos that connects the different NFT platforms on Tezos

Interpop - Comic NFT´s and more

Emergents - Trading card game built on Tezos

Bazaar Markets - Carbon offset NFT marketplace

Truesy - Highly curated NFT marketplace

RadionFM - Music radio streaming platform where you also can buy music NFT´s.

TZcolors - One of the first NFT platforms on Tezos. Only colors!

Mandala - NFT project

Golden Goals (just launched) - Football/soccer NFT´s. Partnering with European football teams to launch NFT´s.

Opensea - The worlds biggest NFT marketplace will soon integrate support for Tezos token standards and Tezos NFT´s.

OneOf (launching soon) - Music NFT platform that raised $63 million. Will feature artists such as Doja Cat, John Legend, H.E.R, Jacob Collier and many more famous artists that will launch music on OneOf.

Versum (launching soon) - NFT marketplace

Minted (Launching soon) - Minted is a platfrom that aims to combine NFT´s with social media. A full fledged NFT social media platform. Rarity tags on NFT´s and comment sections + more. Social media profiles for everyone.

Red Bull - Launching NFT´s on Tezos soon

Mclaren - Building a NFT platform on Tezos

Ubisoft - Planning to launch NFT´s on Tezos soon for their games.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

There is also a bunch of NFT collectibles coming to Tezos. The different collections on Tezos has been exploding. Tezos has very cheap gas fees, less than 1 cent. It takes 30 seconds or less for a transaction to go through, but this will soon be improved more. It is much cheaper and faster than Ethereum.

Furthermore, Tezos is one of the most community driven crypto/blockchains. Tezos has always been about the community and the decentralization. Which also makes it a good platform for NFT´s. Compared to other blockchains, Tezos focuses more on decentralization and will be seen as a platform for and built by the people, and not by rich venture capitalists. Tezos was decentralized from the beginnning with on-chain governance, the vision was always decentralization. Tezos is loved by people, but also loved by companies and people looking to build serious innovative applications. Tezos has emerged as one of the industry standards blockchains for companies looking to leverage blockchain technology. Tezos doesn´t operate with the Ethereum virtuam machine, instead Tezos has it´s own virual machine and technology. And its own programming languages where security is number one priority.

&#x200B;

""Tez"" is what the currency is called. It´s short, easy to remember and sounds good. Tez is actually being used as a currency to buy and sell NFT´s, so its becoming an actual currency. You can send Tez directly to peoples Twitter or Reddit accounts, and NFT artists can verify themselves with Tezos profiles. You can prove that an account belongs to you. You can also create a Tezos domain name, so you don´t have to use a traditional wallet address, but can instead use you name as your wallet address. All around, the infrastructure around Tezos and the support system is top tier. Contract calls on Tezos has been growing a lot over the last months. As more and more NFT projects come to Tezos, more and more users come. People that experience Tezos and Tezos based platforms often stick around because of the good infrastructure and good communites. As Ethereum continues to run into problems, Tezos can capture a bigger and bigger market share until it is the leader.",127.0,2021-08-28 11:03:24,0.81
Syscoins upcoming NEVM and Wallet,"Hello gals and gallows. 

I know everyone is super busy trying to keep up and all with all the new tokens unceremoniously created/premined/P’ed & D’ed/Rug-Pulled and shilled on Reddit at an alarming rate, but I would really love it if I could just stop you for a couple of minutes or so, and give you the safest x100 in the current space. 

I’ll give you the TL/DR right now; you should take half an hour to do a little digging in to what Syscoin is doing RIGHT NOW, not what it’s done before. Syscoin is: Basically Bitcoin (add UTXO assets, opt-in token compliance, zdag), take Dashpay (add multi-quorum chainlocks), take Ethereum (add BTC secured zkRollups), creating a SYStem that is the best of all worlds in the industry = Syscoin

Yes we all know that Syscoin doesn’t have moon or baby in it’s name. It’s an OG coin and It has suffered pretty much nearly everything the bad side of the Crypto world could throw at it, yet it is still developing the most future proof and innovative platform ready for the imminent tech revolution. 

What? Sys…coin?!?’What crypto has coin what is this? 2009
SYS just had its 7th birthday, hence the old out of touch name. But should be dropping the coin element for protocol (TBC)

‘HA, PoW? Boomer coin!’
Syscoin is merge-mined with BTC so barely makes an impact, and we all know BTC isn’t going anywhere. 

‘wasn’t SYS hacked when it was worth like 96BTC?’
This was a Binance API hack, the hackers chose SYS, and the developers tried to help Binance out and bad journalism maintained the false reputation. 

‘Jeez, their marketing sucks!’
Syscoin had 750BTC stolen from their ICO by Moolah, meaning the Devs had to work part time unpaid to get their blockchain rolling. They’ve dedicated their efforts on getting the tech working foremost, and with the release of their own NEVM plan to push as heavy as they can with the marketing. Syscoin is a fully decentralised network, and it’s up to the community effort so has never been able to compete with the centralised pre-mined tokens other projects have for a war chest. This is why most people haven’t heard about it yet are all in on some vapour-ware. If you’re ever looking for an underdog, SYS is it. 
 
‘Right! I remember SYS, the marketplace coin right?’
There was a small amount of devs working on it at the beginning. This has allowed the network to be nimble and change direction if need be. Like some very successful businesses, Sys changed direction as a startup because they realised their chain couldn’t scale to be a true marketplace coin. They decided to create a platform network, to allow anything you want to be on a blockchain and fully scale to be built (even a marketplace). 

‘Just a pump and dump! Look at the charts’
Any token that has been around for as long as SYS has with low price and liquidity has been subject to pump and dumps, the team have never been involved with this. 

Current Stats:
Max Tokens: 888m
Current: 618m
Market Cap: 154m
•Bitcoin merge-mined, second highest hash rate after BTC

I will try to give you the reasons why this is a criminally low market cap

•You can create your own UTXO token or ‘nested’ NFTs for 1 SYS, that scales to 140ktps with ZDAG , secured by BTC, and fully decentralised. 0.00001456 SYS transaction fee. Also has the option to bake in regulation compliance, the only platform that is ready for the coming regulations. Institutions be watching SYS.
 
•New web wallet out in around 2 weeks that allows you to mint and build these easily, SH256 and Trezor compatible. MetaMask contender. 

•Developers created a public company (Blockchain Foundry) to build blockchain solutions for 3rd parties, most solutions being built on SYS to gain adoption. 

•Blockchain Foundry are developing a regulation compliance tool that works with Syscoin and other tokens,  with this and Syscoin, BCFN have built a frictionless and SEC approved way to on board institutions on to Syscoin. 

•Fully decentralised with BTC merge mining and 42% locked in masternodes not PoS as everything secured by miners. nodes help secure the network and run ZDAG and governance. 

•Most large platform tokens are sitting with multi billion dollar marketcaps, plenty of room for SYS to grow as soon as it starts being discovered. 

•CMC watch list has increased by +42000 the past week or so, only matter of time before before it pops. 

•Liquidity is low, SYS is an old token, lots have been lost to time (some estimates of 100milly) coupled with 42% in masternodes and then other hodlers, looking at only 150milly or so left. 

•Jagdeep Sidhu, master coder! Lead dev of Syscoin. He should be as well known as the big boys. Serial pioneering innovator leading Syscoin to various firsts: First inter-coin bridge, first regulation compliance, first nested NFTs (I’m missing a lot more) Syscoin first to implement Segwit and Taproot

•Upcoming vote by POLYGON’s DAO on whether to allow Polygon’s users to settle via PoW via Syscoin as an alternative to PoS. 

•Plenty of great partnerships in Polygon, BIGG, Klever, Binance, House of Kibaa…

If you got this far, we’ll done. Here’s le piece. The biggest news so far is Syscoin has its very own Turing Complete smart contract layer, NEVM, currently in private testnet, ready to go public testnet in 2-3 weeks and should be ready before the end of the year. It’s exciting as it allows fully scalable, decentralised and secure smart contracts secured by PoW. It will be backward compatible with other EVMs and connect with any ZKP. 

There are some big projects currently being built on Syscoin as we speak. REVXM, looking to build sports and entertainment NFTs (parent company has links to the rights to NHL and NBA) and House of Kibaa bringing extended reality and VR NFTs, LUXY which will be an NFT market place and many more. A huge amount of adoption is coming to SYS so this is your opportunity to get in there before the FOMO. 

A recent quote from Dan Wasyluk , Co-Founder, when asked how he saw how Syscoin’s direction with regulation compliance, future proofing and influence it may have on other platforms

Dan - ‘[Syscoin offers]Greater purposes thru both added efficiencies, increased security and additional options for users. Network rulesets implemented in a way that seeks to establish a specification, the first implementation of which is already present in Syscoin SPT on 4.2 and will be further extended by a similar spec for the NEVM layer. 

Because the NEVM spec for compliant tokens will be compatible with any other EVM chain that implements it, we're pushing to be leaders in multi-chain compliance through scalable, offchain network rule sets (easily deployed through upcoming BCF products). Those who choose to issue on Syscoin will have a variety of options not offered by other chains- ranging from simple SPT tokens and NFTs to Turing complete smart contract tokens on the NEVM layer backwards compatible with other EVMs, all of which feature opt-in rulesets. Lots of RnD going on right now...’

There is a great in depth (and more objective!) research paper by House of Chrimea here:

https://res.cloudinary.com/dl8wrczbj/image/upload/v1628251926/HouseofChimera/Report-PDFs/Syscoin-Paper-August_iceisl.pdf

This is the lead devs white paper for the future for SYS :

Debating trading my ETH for ALGO,"I've been mulling this over for months now.

I know ETH will see more short term growth but my gut tells me ALGO will win out in the end. 

I know it's risky, but the thought of having a fat stack of ALGO makes my mouth water for the upcoming governance. I get very scared one of these days ALGO is going to fly past $1.00 and it will never come down again.

I do like Ethereum, and I adore Vitalik but ETH's past security issues as well as today's plant a seed of doubt in my mind and make me very nervous for the upcoming merge.

With that being said my gut is telling me to go all in on ALGO. 

I believe in the team behind it, I believe in the tech, and I believe it's only a matter of time before ALGO takes over the world. One only has to use ALGO a few times, with it's lightning fast transactions, and native wallet to go ""holy shit"". 

I've been collecting NFT's on and off as well, and with the deFI projects launching I have a gut feeling that ALGO will soon not be so niche in the crypto space. 

I also know that as soon as I post this people will say DIVERSIFY YOU BIG DUMMY! The purist in me wants to go all ALGO and then just stop looking at the charts for the next few years and keep stacking.

But, I'm also scared as soon as trade my ETH it will sky rocket lol.

It's not easy being into crypto, the uncertainty can be a killer. But no risk, no reward I suppose.

The blockchain communities never really received the memo: Ethereum is becoming a rollup centric platform,"Ethereum's high fees have become one of the most popular ways of criticizing the platform, and for good reasons.

However with [Optimism currently deploying](https://medium.com/ethereum-optimism/community-launch-7c9a2a9d3e84) and [Arbitrum launching in August](https://offchain.medium.com/a-is-for-arbitrum-a-is-for-august-71391582d95b), Ethereum is about to take advantage of a significant increase in scalability and decrease in transaction fees through rollups, without compromising on decentralization.

But the vast majority of blockchain communities still seem to be completely unaware of this.

In fact, the majority of blockchain enthusiasts never got the following memo:

In 2020, Ethereum switched to a [rollup-centric roadmap](https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/a-rollup-centric-ethereum-roadmap/4698). This change is by far the biggest and most fundamental change that the Ethereum roadmap has ever seen. 

Ethereum L1's role has evolved a lot and it now aims at becoming a settlement layer for rollups. Ethereum is no longer focused on being a smart contract platform, but rather, a platform to build smart contract platforms on top of. This starts with The Merge, which will merge the execution layer (previously eth1) and consensus layer (previously eth2), and continue with the release of data shards. 

The entire roadmap now entirely revolves around the idea that rollups are THE way through which Ethereum will be used by billions.

It's not true anymore that *""Ethereum 2.0 will soon bring fees down""*, rollups will! But this is unfortunately still the most common misconception about Ethereum's road to scalability. 

The reason why is rather obvious: communication around this change has been lacking.

It may be time for this information to be spread more widely, for example through visible and easy to understand articles on [Ethereum.org](https://Ethereum.org), or pinned posts on r/ethereum and r/ethfinance.

We finally have a solid plan to solve one of the most important limitations of blockchains, maybe we should start talking about it a bit more.",1099.0,2021-08-25 14:00:34,0.97
Solana's endgame: becoming an Ethereum rollup,"There's a lot of misinformation and animosity in the space, people love to pit Solana as an ""Ethereum killer"". In this post, I'll make the argument that Solana and Ethereum are better together - each working to the best of their strengths. As the blockchain industry, we have to come together, leave our egos aside and build what is actually the best engineering solution for mass adoption. And I believe this is Solana being a zkRollup on Ethereum.

First, let's get some misconceptions out of the way.

Edit: I'm seeing a lot of comments confusing what I'm saying for the old Ethereum 2.0 model. Please read this next paragraph. All of this is not true anymore! I'll emphasize again. I'd also regret mentioning Ethereum in the title. This is actually not about Ethereum - it's about zkRollups. A zkRollup can leverage whatever offers the highest security, decentralization, and data availability. A zkRollup is fully composable. These are not shards! Currently, Ethereum is best positioned with the rollup-centric roadmap (more below) but it can also be another solution.

Ethereum 2.0 does not exist. I repeat - Ethereum 2.0 is not a thing. This was certainly the case in 2019, but in 2020, Ethereum pivoted to a rollup-centric roadmap. What this means is Ethereum L1 is transforming into a settlement layer for rollups. Ethereum is no longer focused on being a smart contract platform, but rather, a platform to build smart contract platforms on top of. This starts with The Merge, which will merge the execution layer (previously eth1) and consensus layer (previously eth2), and continue with the release of data shards. To put it simply: Users will rollups, rollups will settle on Ethereum.

What are rollups? Rollups are simply blockchains that are laser focused at offering the highest throughput possible with instant transaction confirmations, while leaving the hard work of security and data availability to a different chain that's better at it. This way, it can achieve upto 10x-100x more throughput possible than any L1, by using clever compression techniques. There are several rollups live today, with more rolling out over the next few years.

So, what does Solana as a zkRollup look like? Actually, very similar to zkSync 2.0, which is currently in testnet, with mainnet release due late this year or early next year. Like Solana, zkSync 2.0 leverages LLVM, allows programming in native Rust, and is designed to offer 100,000+ TPS. However, zkSync 2.0 has two key advantages over Solana:

\- Instead of thousands of validators and thousands of non-validating nodes, zkSync 2.0 can be more secure and decentralized than Solana while running ONE sequencer. OK - you need more than one, to cover liveness and censorship resistance risks, but a handful sequencers and provers will offer bulletproof security. This will enable zkSync 2.0 to scale farther than any L1 ever could.

\- This is done by using advanced zero-knowledge proofs. A zkRollup can commit to whatever the most secure and decentralized L1 is at the time (currently, Ethereum) and the zk proof ensures validity.

What this means is that over the long term, by leveraging Ethereum data shards, zkRollups can scale up to millions of TPS, while continuing to be highly secure and decentralized, with being verifiable on consumer PCs. Solana can scale up to 50,000 TPS, according to the description in this subreddit. Let's take this to the next level! By the way, it's very important to note that a zkRollup maintains full composability even across multiple data shards.

So, why can Ethereum data shards help scale Solana to millions of TPS, and why can't it do it all by itself? The answer is simple: Ethereum is targeting 1 million validators long term, and the more validators there are, the more data shards can be deployed. Yes, this is the opposite of the blockchain trilemma. Now, I'm sure you have seen some criticisms about Binance running 10,000 validators - and this is true. However, the beacon chain is at a very early stage, and actually, technically it doesn't matter. What matters is that 1 million validators enables over 1,000 data shards for insane data availability. Next, zkRollups are highly efficient, and through advanced compression and aggregation techniques, it requires 1/10th to 1/100th the data availability a traditional L1 would. Combine highly efficient use of data availability with massive data availability, and you have the holy grail of blockchain scalability.

The incredible thing about zk chains is that you don't even have to exclusively use Ethereum for data availability! You can use both Ethereum and other data availability solutions like Solana itself. Indeed, they can be used concurrently, while still saying composable. Imagine Ethereum and Solana in one chain, fully composable. That's the magic of zk tech! Also, if a different chain offers better security than Ethereum - just migrate there or add that as an option for users.

In short, if Solana becomes a zkRollup:

\- Instant transaction confirmations.

\- Scale up to millions of TPS long term.

\- While still offering the highest possible security and decentralization in the industry, and being verifiable on a consumer PC.

\- Offer users the choice for varying spectrum between cost and security.

\- Remain competitive with future zkRollups like StarkNet and zkSync 2.0 which will outscale all L1s and offer higher security and decentralization.

It's a no-brainer!

Finally, the caveats:

\- This vision will take years to roll out, and it's a highly advanced, complex system which will need years to prove itself. But it's certainly time for Solana to start looking closely at zkSync 2.0, StarkNet, Polygon Hermez and other zkRollups and examining how things progress. Another caveat after thinking about it is that finality is not instant, but because zk proofs are permanent so it's practically the same as the instant confirmation.",318.0,2021-08-24 18:05:41,0.95
"""Eth 2.0"" is deprecated nomenclature - we're One Ethereum again","Five months ago, my first post in r/ethereum (well, at least with this alias) was about calling for [sunsetting the ""Ethereum 2.0"" moniker](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/mhoz7a/opinion_time_to_sunset_the_ethereum_20_branding/). I have since learned that Eth2, Eth 2.0 or Ethereum 2.0 branding is not going anywhere, and will continue to be used. However, it's worth striving for accuracy and calling things by their correct nomenclatures.

Philosophically, you can continue to call ""Eth2"" as an umbrella term for upcoming Ethereum upgrades. Or, narrow it down to the Merge or data shards. But it's best to just call them ""The Merge"" and ""data shards"". We have equally significant upgrades recently done (EIP-1559), and incoming (statelessness & state expiry), which technically don't fall under Eth2. You also have releases like Arbitrum One in a week's time, which are technically outside of Ethereum, which is actually more impactful for the user experience than any other upgrade, and finally delivers the vision of a smart contract chain with relatively low fees without compromising highy security and decentralization. The answer to the oft-obsessed-over question ""wen low gas"" is not Eth2 - it's rollups like Arbitrum One, and it's happening in a week's time! Though, yes, it'll take time for rollups to mature, and data shards will reduce gas further, so it's a couple of years long journey - but it begins in mere days, not weeks! So, it all gets complicated, and I just prefer to consider all of these ""Ethereum upgrades"".

More technically, eth1 and eth2 (not called these anymore! Just for illustration purposes here) are two different chains. Eth1 is what everyone uses now, secured by proof-of-work mining. Eth2 is the beacon chain that went live in December 2020 - this is the proof-of-stake chain. What The Merge does is to, put it simply, merge eth1 and eth2 and turn off proof-of-work mining. At this point, it'll be One Ethereum again.

So, what's changing? You can read the details in [The Great Renaming document](https://notes.ethereum.org/@timbeiko/great-renaming).

What was previously called eth1 is now called the **execution layer**. The Merge will see this layer live on, and to the end user it'd be barely noticeable. All your ETH, tokens, DeFi positions - eveything will remain exactly the same. It's important to note that the execution layer's gas fees will remain high for the foreseeable future. But this won't matter because all users that want low gas fees will be using rollups or rollup-like solutions. Data shards will lower fees on rollups further, but not necessarily on the execution layer.

What was previously called eth2 is now called the **consensus layer**. This is the proof-of-stake layer, which will drive the execution layer after The Merge. Data shards will be built on top of the **consensus layer**, so really, it's more like the consensus and data availability layer in the future.

As we head into The Merge, we should try to stop using the ~~Eth2~~ moniker, and start thinking of all of these as One Ethereum again. We can discuss these various upgrades independently.

\- Want to discuss how fees will be lowered? Talk about rollups.

\- Want to discuss when proof-of-work is replaced with proof-of-stake? Talk about The Merge.

\- What to discuss how fees on rollups can be lowered further? Talk about rollups + data shards.

\- Want to discuss how the beacon chain works or how it'll be upgraded? Talk about the consensus layer.

PS: Of course, consensus layer and execution layer can be quite a mouthful. So here are suggestions for abbreviations: ethx and ethc. Or, ethex and ethcon. Or, ex and con.",41.0,2021-08-23 05:34:50,0.92
Feature Request - Polygon/Matic Bridge,"\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*Update October 18th, 2021\*\*\*\*\*

Issue resolved, the Celsius team will be returning my Polygon tokens sent mistakenly to the matic network. I want to thank them and will be depositing a large portion of my crypto back to the Celsius Network - Hopefully this will shut up the ""you've lost your tokens for good"" crowd\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*

After reading hundreds if not thousands of folks who for innumerable reasons have sent their funds to the Ethereum Layer 2. I'd like to request a feature on Celsius which could benefit everyone.

Some may argue that other exchanges and loan services are also affected by this user generated issue. Others may argue the funds as being lost, which technically is not true because the receiving addresses haven't change. Just go [https://polygonscan.com/](https://polygonscan.com/) and explore your Celsius address.

I like Celsius, very happy with the service and want to add more to my bag. Fact is, Celsius is the future and I wouldn't be surprised if they either merge with a large financial institution or they themselves become the ""de facto"" crypto asset management institution.

Anyways, getting to the point. The feature which could resolve all of these headaches would be the implementation of a ""Matic/Polygon Bridge"" using the existing API available for developers.

Deposits erroneously sent to the Layer 2 network on the Celsius wallet could then be ""bridged"" over to Layer 1 (ERC20) by the customers after they pay the ""bridging"" fees in ETH added to their Celsius wallets. This way Celsius would not have to support ""Layer 2""  but it can promote that it does accept incoming funds, bridging fees have to be paid.

In case there is a cost to develop this, Celsius can add a small fee on each bridging transaction to pay for the development.

This could be a win win for everyone, win for the customer  because they are able to recover their funds and earn interest, win for Celsius as the leading company in taking steps to address the problem and adding a feature that benefits everyone, minimizing their support incidents.

PSA: Monero decentralized mining pool (p2pool),"**Update 2021-08-29**

The test on mainnet is going great so far, [first mainnet block](https://xmrchain.net/block/2437679) has been mined! 3 miners have been [paid](https://xmrchain.net/tx/55f934195bd4450fa210304f51fd6687a4cb9eda58fe593a9cf704116daac48b) in that block!

**Update 2021-09-05**

P2Pool has mined 33 blocks so far, I've set up a pool monitoring page here: [https://p2pool.io/](https://p2pool.io/)

\-----------------------------

Hello everyone!

I've spent the summer on this little (well, not so little) side project and it's 99% ready now and will enter testing phase next week (first on testnet, then on mainnet).

**- Why?**

There's been quite a few worries about mining pool centralization and the possibility of 51% attacks. Since atomic swaps went live, solving exchange delisting/KYC threat, mining is now the most centralized part of the Monero ecosystem. One particular pool accounts for almost 40% of Monero's network hashrate. This is not a long-term stable/safe situation. Pool admin can be pressured to do bad things, go rogue or exit scam. Pool server can be shutdown: many didn't think it was a real possibility, but the [recent events with MoneroOcean](https://www.reddit.com/r/MoneroMining/comments/p8cg2h/aws_takes_down_monero_ocean/) proved them wrong. I expected somethig like this to happen eventually, but I didn't think it would happen so soon. Anyway, the solution is coming!

**- What is it?**

P2Pool combines the advantages of pool and solo mining. You still fully control your Monero node and what it mines, but you get frequent payouts like on a regular pool. No one can use your miner rigs for a 51% attack!

**- How does it work?**

P2Pool, as a proper blockchain implementatioon, is **decentralized**. It has no central server that can be shutdown/blocked. It uses a separate blockchain to merge mine with Monero. Pool admin can't go rogue or be pressured to do an attack on the network because there is no pool admin!  There is no one to decide who can mine on the pool and who can't - it's **permissionless**. All pool blocks pay out to miners immediately. There is no pool wallet, funds are never in custody - it's **trustless**.

P2Pool uses PPLNS payout scheme, has **0% fee** and **0 XMR payout fee** (by design, fees can't be added there). Minimal payout is less than **0.0005 XMR** thanks to the very efficient miner reward transaction format - each individual miner payout takes only 38 bytes on the Monero blockchain!

**- Can it handle the load?**

Monero p2pool is written from scratch in C++. It uses the same high-performance libuv library as xmrig-proxy and each node is able to handle thousands of concurrent miner connections. It supports uncle blocks (like in Ethereum) which allows it to run with very fast block times. I tested it locally with several nodes mining 10 blocks per second and didn't get any orphans! Block times as low as 1 second are possible on the Internet.

The Ethereum FUDBuster - An Attempt 1,"Hey everyone, so I decided to take some time to address some of the common FUD that has been thrown into this subreddit with hopes it may help some newbies into ETH to at least understand the whole context to the FUD that is used usually by Bitcoin Maximalist.

I will definitely make mistakes, so I hope this can be something that everyone will critique so I can improve on it! So let's get on to it!

**ETH IS A PREMINED 'SHIT' COIN**

* Premine refers to the issuance that happened before mining, this in itself is not necessarily a bad thing, unless it is done in such a way that a very small group of people benefits and causes a great inequality.
* The Ethereum sale lasted for 42 days. [Link to the launch page of the sale](https://blog.ethereum.org/2014/07/22/launching-the-ether-sale/) for more information. The sale gave enough information and can be also arguably said to be more public and reached more people than when satoshi started mining bitcoin by posting it on the bitcointalk forum.
* [Link to the results of the sale](https://blog.ethereum.org/2014/08/08/ether-sale-a-statistical-overview/) after 2 weeks. Interestingly, the result of the sale had a Gini coefficient that is lower than bitcoin's at the time, possibly indicating that initial ETH distribution is more equal than Bitcoin's distribution. This is of course assuming that every sale participant address is unique.
* Overall result is that 60 million of ETH is sold to the sale participants and 12 million is created for the Ethereum foundation to fund activities. (This is the premine). [Some good data here.](https://keepingstock.net/overview-ethereum-s-initial-public-sale-563c05e95501) This is the part where bitcoin maxis will usually say that vitalik and co will dump their ETH on us, assuming of course these 72 million in ETH has not been moved at all and everyone who bought in has diamondhanded until now (SPOILER: This is a stupid argument).
* The 72 million premine accounts for about 61% of current ETH total supply (117 million at the time of writing). Again with the fact that this happened 7 years ago, the distribution of ether from that time since now has of course diluted the holdings of the initial sale participant. Though I must confess I do not have the data on that. If anyone can share some, that would be awesome.

**ETH is a INFLATIONARY SHITCOIN with UNLIMITED SUPPLY**

* Inflation or deflation is a neutral term, it depends on the goals of the underlying asset to decide whether it is good or bad. It is correct that we have unlimited supply, but that does not mean there will be unlimited ETH in circulation. This is neither a good or a bad thing.
* Ethereum has had a few forks that adjusted the rate of inflation since the genesis block. Historical changes to the issuance can be found [here.](https://docs.ethhub.io/ethereum-basics/monetary-policy/) The changes to issuance reflects ethereum's monetary policy of minimum necessary issuance.
* On contrast, it also does not mean that a limited supply is a good thing, for bitcoin for example, this raises concerns that when all 21 million of BTC is minted or when subsequent halvings have passed, there needs to be enough bitcoin transaction fees to incentivize miners to mine the chain and secure the network. Other coins like monero have tail issuance at the end of minting, that ensures miners are still compensated via a block reward component rather than just transaction fees. Only time will tell which is the best option.
* **EIP-1559 introduces the necessary deflationary pressure** to ETH, by burning ETH based on the demand on blockspace. **This does not in itself make ETH deflationary,** but it allows for the protocol to algorithmically adjust its own monetary policy by linking it to network usage. This eliminates the need for community consensus to be made to reduce issuance further up until the merge.
* The merge, whereby the consensus layer will be replaced by PoS will further reduce issuance, **causing ETH inflation to significantly decrease!** This is because it is less costly to run a PoS validator compared to a PoW miner, and hence we can reward them less to secure the network. I find [this page](https://www.attestant.io/posts/charting-ethereum-issuance/) does the issuance numbers some justice.

**PoS is shit and leads to centralization, enriching Vitalik and co who has a lot of stake in ethereum.** credit to /u/SwagtimusPrime

* Proof of stake in Ethereum is designed such that stakers need to align themselves to the interest of the network or else they risk to get slashed. Slashing would effectively cause one's staked ETH to be burned and he gets kicked out of the validator pool, reducing his stake and voting power in the system.
* For concerns regarding early adopters having more power in PoS, refer to arguments under premine. People had 7 years chance to get into ETH and get some voting power, the move to PoS has always been the goal of the ethereum ecosystem.
* It is correct to say that the more ethereum you have to stake, the more you will earn and eventually you can hold more. There are mechanisms in the PoS system that is designed to discourage pooling.
   * The hardware requirements to run PoS consensus node is very light, you can even run them on a raspberry pi
   * The 32 ETH requirement is the result of the above. Remember that this was made when ETH price was in the 3 digits, and hence was very accessible to a lot of people.
   * For people without 32ETH, the coredevs are looking into something called the [secret shared validators](https://medium.com/bloxstaking/secret-shared-validator-ssv-phase-1-testing-summary-5e3f5ab06083), which allows smaller trustless pools to be formed, unlike exchange pools where you deposit your eth and hope they behave. (Note, if they don't behave, they will lose your and their own ETH due to slashing, which they have to compensate one way or the other, making an attack very costly).
   * The execution clients high disk requirement due to state bloat is being solved slowly through [state expiry research](https://hackmd.io/@vbuterin/state_expiry_paths). I am not sure if ReGenesis is also in the cards for this.
* Vitalik himself did a good write up on this in [this page](https://vitalik.ca/general/2020/11/06/pos2020.html).
* Essentially with slashing mechanisms in place, it is much more costly to attack the PoS system compared to PoW as attackers would need to procure enough ETH to game the system, and is also willing to burn these ETH in case their attacks fail. In PoW, the ASICs or GPU can be continuously used to attack the chain over and over again. Take a look at Bitcoin SV for referrence.
* Some additional good points from /u/SwagtimusPrime [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/p99i4q/the_ethereum_fudbuster_an_attempt_1/h9wwfqv?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)

**Nobody knows how many ETH there is**

* This was actually a fairly recent FUD and is not true. In etherscan for example, you can look at the total number of ETH very [easily](https://etherscan.io/accounts). IIRC there were some differences found simply because the scripts made by different people did not account for some edge cases.

**Ethereum will never scale, too much bloat**

* Scaling is a hard process, the scalability trilemma (i.e. scalability(speed), security, and decentralization) is something that needs to be considered when trying to scale ethereum.
* A lot of work is being done for this and I will try to mention some of them here
   * State expiry - reduce state bloat and allow lower requirement to run execution clients
   * [Layer 2 ](https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/a-rollup-centric-ethereum-roadmap/4698)centric roadmap - zk-rollups and optimistic rollups are solving scaling while maintaining low costs and is running now! They are still in beta however.
   * Data shards in consensus client can work together with rollups to allow for even more tps.
* Ethereum direction towards statelesness will also make this easier going forward. [u/Liberosist](https://www.reddit.com/user/Liberosist/) made a good writeup of it [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/o1s8an/statelessness_state_expiry/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3). 

**Vitalik makes all decision in Ethereum Changes**

* If someone tells you this with a passion, I suggest you ignore them as they are not going to listen to any good arguments with that brain.
* In all seriousness, vitalik has taken the backseat in making a lot of the core devs decision lately. What he is focused on is to bring some research data and making roadmaps which can be heavily contested by others in the coredevs team.
* It is not like vitalik has a master key to ethereum to make it do what he wants, seriously. If anyone feels that what he suggests is shit, they will not implement it. He also has to go through the same EIP process as everyone when proposing an improvement.

**Gas Fees are too expensive, nobody will use ETH**

* Gas fees are expensive because everybody is fucking using the network. Goddamnit can you all stop minting shitty NFTs (not you Ethfinance, you ok.) with ridiculous prices.
* On a more serious note, yes this is bad, I don't like it, nobody likes it. It creates a significant barrier to entry for a lot of newcomers to the space.
* What is good though, is that we are aware of it, and are working towards resolving it.
* Increasing the block gas limit is not always the best solution as this worsens state bloat. If they have solutions to the state growth, we can consider to start increasing block limit.
* Layer 2 are relatively cheap to use, however, they still don't integrate very well with exchanges and many DApps (Soon is our best hope)
* Will people run to other chains due to this? Sure they might, but that does not necessarily mean the end of ETH. I have yet to see a chain that is as decentralized as ethereum, that can handle as many transactions with minimal cost.

OK I need a break, probably will add more when I feel like it. Other points to talk about if anyone wants to help

* Ethereum can reverse your transaction if coredevs feels like it (The DAO)
* No ethereum full node exists except archive node",43.0,2021-08-22 09:28:22,0.94
Genba: A Guess At GameStop's Secret Strategy And How It Will Revolutionize the Videogame Market,"This post lays out the steps that RC and the new GameStop team have taken in the past few months to achieve their strategic objectives.  It also identifies where the company is likely going, based on some key subdomains that went live in the past few months.

*A quick note:* there's a lot of derivative information here.  If you see a link or concept that you mentioned months ago, please accept my appreciation, even if you're not mentioned.  Feel free to claim recognition in the comments.

I published another post about a week ago (linked further down), explaining the various subdomains that GameStop uses.  If I did my job right, you now understand that **GameStop subdomains clearly describe the software, services, and technologies** that they use to deliver value and delight customers.  

This post builds on that understanding and expands into old and new GameStop operations.
I had to leave a lot of content out to keep this focused, but it's long anyway.

While this post is forward-looking, it could always be wrong.  ***First, never take (financial) advice from internet strangers.  Second, as the old Danish aphorism goes, “It is difficult to make predictions, especially about the future.”***  Feel free to make corrections in comments.

#TA;DR

***Ryan Cohen has achieved for GameStop what he did for Chewy, but eight times faster.***

***Genba Digital is a British company that GameStop seems to be doing business with.***

***Combining Genba’s seamless digital videogame marketplace with non-fungible tokens (NFTs) on the blockchain and the Interplanetary File System (IPFS) for digital rights management will create a completely unique cloud-based videogame marketplace that will enable both developers and players to trade device-agnostic digital content while still supporting the original creators.***

***Maybe GameStop will purchase Azerion Holdings, Genba’s parent company and a major videogames and advertising company in Europe.***

#CHEWY VS. GAMESTOP, KEEPING SCORE

We could measure success of the GameStop strategy if we had a measuring stick to use for comparison.  Since the current strategy has Ryan Cohen as the Chairman of the Board and the chair of GameStop’s Strategic Planning & Allocation Committee, it seems fair to measure GameStop’s transformation against RC’s other great accomplishment: Chewy.

**COMPARISONS:**

1) **Inception** &nbsp;  

- RC decides to go into the pet business after an epiphany following a planned jewelry company that would have launched at the end of 2010, probably around the Miami Beach Antique Jewelry and Watch Show, 15-17 October 2010.&nbsp;
- RC Ventures acquires a 13% stake in GameStop on 17 December 2020.&nbsp;

2) **Starting the business**&nbsp;

- Mr. Chewy internet domain launched sometime on or after 9 May 2011.  
- GameStop board reaches a deal to appoint RC, Alan Attal, and Jim Grube to the BOD on 11 January 2021.&nbsp;

3) **Re-branding**  

- Chewy.com domain launches not earlier than 30 August 2012.
- EB Games Canada announces re-branding to GameStop.ca on 28 July 2021.

4) **First-Round Funding**

- Chewy gains first-round funding of $15 million USD from Larry Cheng with Volition Capital in October 2013.
- GameStop gains “first-round funding” of $551 million USD by completing an at-the-market (ATM) share offering by 26 April 2021.

5) **First New Warehouse**

- Chewy leases a 400,000 square foot fulfillment center  in Mechanicsburg, Pennsylvania, in early 2014.  The warehouse was effective by August 2014.
- GameStop leases a 700,000 square foot fulfillment center in York, Pennsylvania (almost next door to Mechanicsburg) on 3 May 2021.  The warehouse held a hiring fair on 8 July 2021 and is operational.

6) **Second New Warehouse**

- Chewy opened another fulfillment center in McCarran, Nevada in 2014.  This was converted from an old Toys R Us warehouse.  McCarran is a suburb of greater Reno.
- GameStop announced a 530,000 square foot second fulfillment center in Reno, Nevada on 6 July 2021

7) **Additional Funding**

- In 2014, Chewy gained $30 million USD from its second round of VC funding and $41 million USD from its third round of VC funding.
- GameStop gained “second round funding” of $1.126 billion USD by completing an ATM share offering by 22 June 2021.

8) **Building the Dream Team**

- Throughout 2015-2018, Ryan Cohen recruited top talent for Chewy by contacting people through LinkedIn and conducting after-hours interviews.
- Between January and June 2021, GameStop assembled a strong executive team from leading eCommerce companies around the world.  

Key members in the transformation include:

- Alan Attal (the third member of Chewy and former COO, now on the GameStop BOD and Strategic Planning & Capital Allocation Committee), 
- Jim Grube (brought into Chewy in 2015 as CFO and now on the GameStop BOD and Strategic Planning & Capital Allocation Committee),
- Larry Cheng (Chewy’s first angel investor, now on the GameStop BOD),
- Kelli Durkin (brought into Chewy in 2015 as VP of Customer Service, now SVP for Customer Care at GameStop); I think she’s the reason for cards at Chewy and she’s doing the same for GameStop now,
- Neda Pacifico (VP of eCommerce for Chewy, now SVP of eCommerce for GameStop),
- Andrea Wolfe (VP of Marketing at Chewy, now VP of Brand at GameStop)

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

Let me break this down a bit more:

1. Chewy went from concept to implementation in about **7 months**. The RC Ventures version of GameStop went from concept to implementation in about **2 months**.&nbsp;

2. Chewy rebranded itself after about **15 months**. GameStop rebranded itself after about **6 months**.&nbsp;

3. Chewy gained its first capital injection after about **29 months**. The RC GameStop gained its first capital injection in less than **4 months**.

4. Chewy launched its first new warehouse in Pennsylvania after about **36 months**. The RC GameStop launched its first new warehouse in Pennsylvania after about **6 months**.

5. Chewy launched its second new warehouse in Nevada after about **36 months**. The RC GameStop launched its second new warehouse in Nevada after about **6 months**.

6. Chewy gained its second capital injection after about **36 months**. The RC GameStop gained its second capital injection after about **6 months**.

7. Chewy began building a world-class C-suite after about **48 months**. The RC GameStop built a world-class C-suite within **5 months**.

8. Chewy began innovating in customer care after about **48 months**. The RC GameStop began innovating in customer care within **4 months**.

&nbsp;

***Ryan Cohen has repeated his Chewy success within GameStop already.***

&nbsp;

With an established international infrastructure, existing brand equity, and faster access to capital for leading projects, he has **reduced the time needed to achieve change to only about 6 months compared to 48 months**.  He is moving 8x faster than he did the first time, using his personal ethics of extreme focus to deliver the kind of service that delights customers and retains them for life.  There is still more work needed to cement the gains in supply chain management, customer care, and omni-channel ease-of-use for GameStop customers, but the big parts are already in place.  Truly, this transformation is a world-class achievement.  **On this alone, GameStop shares are currently undervalued, especially if you consider that the Chewy timeline ended with the largest-ever purchase of an eCommerce company for $3.5 billion USD and -- after IPO -- Chewy is valued at $34 billion USD**.  Even without MOASS, that's what GameStop will look like by 2024.

#LET’S PLAY MONOPOLY, VIDEOGAMES EDITION

There’s a great YouTube video from a Stanford lecture series on creating a startup.  Peter Thiel, PayPal and Palantir founder, [presents a compelling explanation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oKjLVECMKA) for why “Competition is for Losers.”  His point is that a strong company creates value in a unique way – a way that no competitor can replicate.  A good company creates a “monopoly” in its industry.

In its 10-K form, filed at the end of the fiscal year, GameStop [identifies the companies that It believes are its competitors](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001326380/000132638021000032/gme-20210130.htm):

- Wal-Mart, Target, Best Buy, and Amazon in the U.S.
- Sony Microsoft, Nintendo, Media Markt, Saturn, FNAC, Carrefour, Auchan, and Amazon in Europe
- Wal-Mart and Best Buy in Canada
- JB HiFi, Big W, and Target in Australia

Looking at this list, I don’t see genuine competition.  Many of these companies are “we sell everything” companies; videogame sales are a small part of their overall revenue stream.  Videogame and console makers – Sony, Microsoft, and Nintendo – might sell their own products directly, but they mostly rely on other companies (like GameStop) for sales and distribution.  In the U.S., Best Buy is the closest apples-to-apples competitor, because it’s a brick-and-mortar retailer that focuses on electronics and media sales.  But even then, videogames are simply not a large enough part of Best Buy’s overall revenue compared to GameStop.

GameStop is a “monopoly” in its market.  It is the only major global retailer in its markets that delivers value to customers with a singular focus on videogames and gaming culture.

And GameStop is an important part of the videogames industry.  **Reggie Fils-Aim&#233;** (former President and COO of Nintendo of America) is a somewhat active Twitter user.  But when he sat on the GameStop board, he **sent only one tweet related to GameStop**:

>**The gaming industry needs a healthy and vibrant \@GameStop**. I look forward to being a part of \@GameStopCorp Board and helping to make this happen. https://t.co/pYWFGZ9XKj

&nbsp;

***GameStop is a critical part of the videogame industry’s ability to identify potential customers, gather information about trends and preferences, and distribute games and consoles to users worldwide.***

#EVEN IF I DIDN’T FINISH THE GAME, I LEARNED A LOT ALONG THE WAY

GameStop has acquired a variety of skills throughout its lifetime.  These were failed projects, but they gave GameStop insights into key aspects of the market.  Since GameStop is less than 20 years old as a corporation (I’m not including Babbage’s or EB Games prior to the GameStop incorporation in 2002), the company still retains institutional memory from these earlier ventures.

- **Kongregate**: GameStop acquired indie game developer Kongregate in 2010.  The site hosted a variety of web-based games.  It also had a software development kit to help indie developers build games for mobile devices and Steam.  GameStop sold Kongregate to Swedish company Modern Times Group in 2017.  I will never understand why Reddit forums filled with apes never jumped on the opportunity to have a tagline like, “A Place for GameStop Apes to Kongregate.”  Also, this company’s logo features ants.  Shoutout to our Korean brethren.
- **Jolt Online Gaming**: GameStop acquired Jolt in 2009.  This was another web site that delivered web-based games.  It also included game reviews and interviews.  The site closed in 2012.
- **Impulse**: This was basically a Steam clone that GameStop acquired in 2011.  Customers could purchase, download, and play games from an online digital marketplace.  The program was discontinued in 2014, and unfortunately customers no longer have access to any games they purchased on the service.  Strangely, GameStop has maintained the “Impulse Store” subdomain and it’s still current.
- **Spawn Labs**: GameStop acquired Spawn Labs and its [patent](https://patents.google.com/patent/US8998719B1/en) [portfolio](https://patents.google.com/patent/US9675877B2/en) in 2011 also.  Spawn Labs provided technology to stream video games from the cloud to any front-end console or computer.  Here’s a [good demo with bad production quality](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M86CLcPiK28). 
- **GS Mobile**: GameStop incorporated mobile phone sales into some of its U.S. stores, beginning in May 2012.  They partnered with AT&T as the mobile carrier for service.  The GameStop mobile phone carrier was branded as Spring Mobile, and it was the single largest AT&T wireless reseller at the time.  This part of GameStop was sold off in 2020 so the company could refocus on gaming and gaming culture.

&nbsp;

From all of these past failures, here are the skills that may still be resident within the collective consciousness of GameStop:

- **Web-based gaming**
- **Mobile gaming**
- **Indie game development and distribution**
- **Mobile networks and telephony**
- **Device-agnostic streaming video games**
- **Digital gaming marketplace**

&nbsp;

There’s are two other key features that GameStop brings to the videogames industry.  GameInformer magazine and PowerUp Rewards.

**GameInformer**, with over 10 million subscribers, is the fifth largest magazine circulation in the United States and (adding other countries) the **fourth largest magazine circulation in the world**.

**PowerUp Rewards**, GameStop’s in-store discount purchasing program, has **over 60 million members**.

&nbsp;

There’s a great [Freakonomics podcast interview with Jeff Immelt](https://freakonomics.com/podcast/jeff-immelt/), the former CEO of General Electric.  Immelt watched GE decline in value from the most profitable company in the world to a current valuation that’s only one quarter what it had when he took over as CEO in 2001.  In the interview, Immelt identifies what – for him – is the key driver of success for large companies in today’s markets:

>If you think about the conglomerates of today — I’m talking about Amazon and Alphabet — they have a technical foundation. I would say G.E. had, at least in the beginning of my career, our foundation was management practices. It’s not that that’s unimportant. But that wasn’t enduring, really. And I think when you look at Amazon, they are a dominant software company. And in some way, shape, or form, everything they do feeds off that. Google was a dominant A.I. company. Everything they do feeds off that, right? So I think if you want to be a conglomerate today, a technical foundation is a must.

GameStop is the sole “information technology” company for the videogames industry.

https://www.forbes.com/sites/paularosenblum/2015/09/14/gamestop-uses-data-and-customer-experience-to-survive-and-thrive-in-stores-and-online/

If you don’t already know, large companies generate a lot of revenue by collecting and selling information about your web surfing habits, purchasing habits, and overall demographic information.  This is the Information Technology that Jeff Immelt was talking about that makes Amazon and Alphabet such large companies today.  From Alexa and OK Google to your web searches to your subscription deliveries, [modern companies benefit from the knowledge they have that other companies want](https://www.pcmag.com/news/how-companies-turn-your-data-into-money).

> More identifying information can simply be purchased. ""Facebook is taking offline credit card data and mixing it with their site,"" Weinberg said, to illustrate the lack of transparency he sees in the data market. ""You wouldn't expect that. The bigger the data profile . . . the better you can be targeted. They have incentives to buy and combine extra data."" After our interview, it came to light that Google had penned a secret deal with MasterCard for data on offline spending habits.

Now, this article was written for an American audience.  Europoors at least benefit from some protection under GDPR.

If you’re offended that your personal information is being harvested, I feel like I’ve just awakened you from the Matrix.  This is how all large companies build profiles to develop more popular products, deliver more appealing marketing, and identify more affluent customers.  In fact, [Target can tell you when your teenage daughter accidentally became pregnant](https://www.forbes.com/sites/kashmirhill/2012/02/16/how-target-figured-out-a-teen-girl-was-pregnant-before-her-father-did/
).

Back in fall 2020, u/DeepFuckingValue noted the potential for a GameStop renovation to improve advertising revenue along with a move towards an “omni-channel” marketplace.  This was always part of the GameStop transformation.  Here’s a single example of his fundamentals-based thesis.

https://twitter.com/TheRoaringKitty/status/1325573568822915077

GameStop uses the company [Moveable Ink](https://movableink.com/product) to deliver a web site experience that is completely unique for each person who visits GameStop’s web sites.

The whole reason for turning GameStop stores into Pokemon Go gyms was so that GameStop could acquire mobile phone identifiers, correlated with Google accounts and Pokemon Go playing statistics, correlated with a customer’s GameStop purchase history, correlated with demographic and spending details that were purchased online for pennies on the dollar.  GameStop can use its cloud-based Tableau instance to provide rapid data visualization to infer key trends in customer preferences.  They will sell this information to Sony, Nintendo, and Microsoft (and perhaps the big game companies like Blizzard-Activision, Sega, or Epic) to create a templated profile for what a top-selling future game might look like.  Simultaneously, GameStop can use each Pokemon Go gym visit as a proxy for how many customers are visiting its brick-and-mortar operations.  This helps to show that GameStop’s retail storefronts are far from dead (as the Wall Street propagandists would have you believe).

&nbsp;

Okay, putting it all together:

***GameStop is transitioning from a brick-and-mortar focus towards a digital-first information technology company.  It has a variety of skills stored within its institutional memory, including web games, mobile phones, mobile apps, streaming gaming, and digital-download videogame distribution.  It has a proprietary database of over 60 million gamers that it combines with other demographic data to create the most valuable database of gamers in the world.  This gamer database, along with GameStop’s worldwide supply chain, makes it so indispensable that “The gaming industry needs a healthy and vibrant GameStop.”***

&nbsp;

But what if I told you that it’s going to get even better?

#NOW, FOR THE MOON SHOT

In my last post, I mentioned a company called **Genba Digital**.  I think they are directly connected to GameStop’s NFT infrastructure.

- ```nft.gamestop.com``` goes live 17 May 2021
- ```genba.gamestop.com``` was updated 17 May 2021
- ```powerpass.gamestop.com``` was updated 17 May 2021
- ```ipfs.nft.gamestop.com``` goes live 20 July 2021
- Ethereum’s London Hard Fork happened 4 August 2021

#####FIRST, NFT

In the post below, u/schismsaints lays out a great list of possible business uses for NFTs on the Ethereum blockchain.

https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/of20ou/a_deep_dive_into_nftgamestopcom/

>Possible Business Uses
>
>- In-store currency - GME Coin can be used as an in-store currency/reward system
>- Crypto swap/exchange - Partner with an established cryptocurrency company to facilitate listing and conversion/exchange between stablecoins such as USDC or miscellaneous established coins or altcoins, and GME specific tokens. Use a GME app to manage a crypto wallet and exchange between various tokens/coins/currencies.
>- NFT Collectibles - i.e. CryptoKitties, Gods Unchained, etc. Facilitate in-person trading (either in-store or via app to app trading) of digital items and collectibles between platforms.
>- Digital game licensing - revolutionize DRM by hosting a record of your game license on the blockchain
>- In-game item transfer/entitlement - Imagine if there was a way to trade/sell your CounterStrike skins in-person for cash, or exchange a cool knife skin for a new CryptoKitty

#####SECOND, IPFS

In the post below, u/hooper359 explains how IPFS works with the ERC-721 NFTs on the Ethereum blockchain.  From all I've seen, u/hooper359 was the first to identify the new IPFS subdomain for GameStop.

https://www.reddit.com/user/hooper359/comments/osr91k/new_ipfs_subdomain_possibly_for_a_digital_games/

There’s also a web site that provides details about what the Interplanetary File System (IPFS) is, how it works, and how to integrate it into existing blockchain systems.

https://docs.ipfs.io/

The key [features or proposed uses cases of IPFS](https://docs.ipfs.io/concepts/usage-ideas-examples/) that are relevant to this conversation are:


- Proof of Ownership
- Blockchain-powered online commerce
- Distributed package managers (DPM) and content delivery networks (CDN)
- Version control
- Selling digital files
- Serverless online gaming

#####THIRD, GENBA

Now, let’s take a look at Genba.

My last post was a look at GameStop subdomains.  

https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/p2rnqn/a_review_of_gamestop_subdomains/

That post was set up to preface this post by highlighting one key feature of GameStop’s subdomains.

**GameStop subdomains describe the branded services or products that GameStop uses in its network infrastructure.**

GameStop has a subdomain ```genba.gamestop.com```.  It first appeared in early 2020, but it was **last refreshed on 17 May 2021 at the same time the NFT subdomain appeared**.

&nbsp;

***The name Genba is fairly unique.***

&nbsp;

If you’re familiar with “Lean” concepts in manufacturing and supply chain management, *Gemba* is a fairly well-known term.  It roughly translates to the old business cliché of “Management By Walking Around” (MBWA).  It requires leaders in organizations to actually “go and see for themselves” what’s happening in the operations center, warehouses, or retail front lines of the company.

But the Lean version of *Gemba* is always spelled with the letter “**M**” like in G**M**E, almost never spelled with an “**N**” like in **N**aked Shorts.  **[Here’s a blog post](http://artoflean.com/index.php/2016/03/25/is-it-genba-or-gemba/) by a Lean expert explaining the difference in spelling**.

If you search for the **Genba-with-an-N** spelling, only two companies come up.  

One is a Lean consultancy in Washington state.  It was incorporated in Delaware, but it doesn’t use the same registered agent that GameStop uses.  Also, what does walking around the operations center have to do with videogames?

***The second company is Genba Digital.***

Genba Digital is a startup in Leamington Spa, outside of Birmingham, England.  They have offices in London, England; Eindhoven, Netherlands; and Los Angeles, California. They started in 2015 with investment from UK and EU venture-capital firms.  

https://genbadigital.com/

https://pitchbook.com/profiles/company/158919-13

Here’s how they describe themselves:

>Developer of a cloud-based digital logistics platform designed to bridge the gap between publishers and resellers in the gaming industry on a global basis. The company's platform is API driven and fully-automated that eliminates the operational and technical logistics involved with publishing and selling digital content, enabling game publishers to avail automatic, secure delivery of activation keys, official publisher metadata and videos in multiple languages.

Genba Digital lists over 200 partnerships on its web site, including:

- Amazon
- Ubisoft
- Disney
- Square Enix
- Epic Games
- Konami
- 2K
- Sega
- Capcom
- Take 2 Interactive
- Paradox Interactive
- Hello Games
- Gamesplanet
- Games Republic
- 505 Games
- Codemasters
- Curve Digital
- Team 17
- Hello Games
- Voidu

Sony [created Genba back in 2013](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/sony-dadc-launches-genba-digital-games-supply-chain--distribution-services-210543551.html).  Their DADC (Digital Audio Disc Corporation) New Media Solutions division [hired Kwiboo to develop the initial concept](https://www.kwiboo.com/case-studies/genba-web_platform/).  In their site, they call Genba “***the world’s first digital supply chain management platform for the games industry. Linking games publishers with game eTailers, on a global scale, to drive efficiencies in relationship management, content distribution and consistent pricing.***”

On 18 May 2021 Genba Digital was acquired by Azerion Holdings.  **This is exactly one day after GameStop launched its NFT domain and refreshed its Genba domain**.  [According to the UK’s Companies House website](https://find-and-update.company-information.service.gov.uk/company/09491005/filing-history), Erol Erturk and Umut Akpinar were appointed as directors of the company.  Umut Akpinar is the [Founder and CEO of Azerion](https://www.linkedin.com/in/umutakpinar/), a videogames company based out of Amsterdam, Netherlands.  Erol Erturk is the [Executive Vice President of Content and Strategic Partnerships](https://www.pocketgamer.biz/news/72583/azerion-fully-acquires-spil-games/) for Azerion.

https://azerion-investors.com/reports/

https://azerion.com/companies

I don’t want to get lost explaining Azerion, but there’s one last possibility I want to touch on.  Azerion is a relatively large European gaming and advertising company.  Their gross profit in 2020 was €70 million EUR.  ***If GameStop wanted to acquire Azerion, the company is not too large to be reasonably purchased for a price within the available cash GameStop is holding***.  This would also be a way to re-enter the northern European markets after closing stores in 2020.

With the Genba subdomain, it’s clear that GameStop has a relationship with Genba Digital, but it’s not clear whether this is a business partnership or a pending acquisition.  There's not enough info to clarify, so let’s just keep looking at the potential that Genba Digital brings to GameStop.

**Genba Digital’s platform helps to solve some of the major problems with videogame distribution globally.**

One challenge that games developers face is [grey market key reselling](https://advanced-television.com/2019/12/04/genba-digital-continues-to-evolve-the-way-video-games-are-sold-online/).  Users who are finished playing a game resell their game keys online, cutting out the company’s profits for digital distribution.  Genba Digital [partnered with Ubisoft in May 2019](https://www.pcgamer.com/ubisoft-is-trying-to-wipe-out-key-reselling-with-silent-key-activation/) to implement a process they called “Silent Key Activation,” or SKA.  The Genba Digital platform provides the digital license keys silently to the user’s platform, so the user never sees the actual license key and can’t resell it on the grey market.

This is less of an issue in the United States or Europe, where users are playing on their personal devices – consoles, mobile phone, desktop gaming rigs.  But in Asia, and especially China, most players access their favorite titles through cyber cafes.  In this case, the software developer sells a license to a user based on an account login.  This makes grey-market key reselling a bigger issue for these companies to capture revenue.

One last speculation about *Genba*.  Remember when RC [tweeted his visit](https://mobile.twitter.com/ryancohen/status/1381829698263654401) to the GameStop in Culver City, California?  Back then, there was a lot of speculation that GameStop might merge with Super League Gaming (SLGG) because they’re based out of Los Angeles.  If you notice the Genba description above, they also have offices in Los Angeles.  The tweet was on 13 April, just a little over one month before the NFT and Genba domains launched and Azerion acquired Genba Digital.  I know I’m speculating, but I wonder whether Azerion is secretly buying up gaming companies on behalf of GameStop, like that [scene at the end of Batman Begins](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vw4KaI6dpBo) when Dr. Michael Burry pulls a fast one on Roy Batty and buys Wayne Enterprises without anyone knowing.

#POWERS COMBINED

Let’s bring all of these parts together, to make the big picture clear.

- GameStop creates an **NFT** framework to identify ownership.
- GameStop uses **IPFS** technology to identify unique ownership of videogame licenses, downloadable content, in-game items, in-game currency, and digital collectibles related to gaming and pop culture.
- GameStop uses the **Genba** platform to create a seamless transactional marketplace for all customers.
- Customers can move personal transactions back into the White Market, conducting secondary sales through GameStop’s NFT-driven digital marketplace.
- Original developers receive transactional royalties in perpetuity from all trades related to their intellectual property; GameStop receives a fractional percent of all revenue generated in its marketplace.
- Fans and independent artists create specialty characters, costumes, and items that can be sold in a secondary marketplace, like Etsy for videogames.
- Software developers can create limited-edition videogames with inherent value based on rarity, similar to how [Wu Tang Clan created a single copy of its “Once In Shaolin” album](https://www.bloomberg.com/features/2015-martin-shkreli-wu-tang-clan-album/).
- GameStop creates a secondary digital market for “used” digital games and collectibles, exactly how it has done with physical game media and collectibles in its brick-and-mortar stores.
- Every transaction will be written publicly to the blockchain.  But each account will remain anonymously hidden as a hexadecimal hash code.  But **by linking the blockchain accounts to GameStop PowerUp Rewards accounts or PowerPass accounts, GameStop will have a monopoly on the true identities of its marketplace users**.  This will give GameStop a unique advantage in providing customer data to software developers around the world.

It might be better though if [GameStop’s Principal Engineer explains how this will work](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/magic-gathering-multiverse-metaverse-jordan-holberg/).

***GameStop is about to completely change the videogame industry.***

#THE FINAL BOSS

One of the great challenges of cryptocurrency adoption is that it can take forever to make a transaction.  Once you agree with another person to give away your cryptocurrency in exchange for some material object or service, the network still has to validate that you have the currency available and that the exchange properly moved that currency to the correct recipient.  This can take several minutes or several hours, depending on the condition of the network at the time.

In contrast, you can flash your mobile phone at a near-field communication (NFC) receiver and buy your Starbucks coffee in seconds.  Even if you use your chip-and-pin card to make a purchase, the whole transaction takes less than a minute.  EVERY. SINGLE. TIME.

This is because companies like Visa have built a very large infrastructure to make sure that money moves quickly throughout the world.  The speed of the network is measured in “transactions per second” (TPS).  **Visa, with a 20,000 TPS network speed, is the Goliath against which cryptocurrency developers compare themselves**. (People argue about what the true TPS is for Visa, I’m ready for the comments…)

There is an equivalently monolithic goliath for digital videogame transactions.  

&nbsp;

**It’s Steam.**

&nbsp;

When GameStop was trying to deliver games digitally with its Impulse service at 10% of the U.S. market, Steam was crushing GameStop with 70% of the U.S. market.  Steam is the largest and most popular digital game distribution platform worldwide, with over 30,000 titles available for download.  Nearly half of all software developers sell their games on Steam.  

But developers don’t want to sell on Steam, or Apple’s App Store, or Google Play.  These companies take a 30% haircut on every single transaction in their markets.  This is why Epic Games took Apple to the U.S. Supreme Court.

***Building a cohesive and seamless videogame market that can compete with Steam is the true final boss that GameStop must face***.  But to achieve success while also giving *Power to the Players*, *Power to the Creators*, and *Power to the Collectors*, without gouging developers with a 30% cut on every transaction – that will be what truly makes GameStop into the clear market dominator.

#TA;DR

***Ryan Cohen has achieved for GameStop what he did for Chewy, but eight times faster.***

***Genba Digital is a British company that GameStop seems to be doing business with.***

***Combining Genba’s seamless digital videogame marketplace with non-fungible tokens (NFTs) on the blockchain and the Interplanetary File System (IPFS) for digital rights management will create a completely unique cloud-based videogame marketplace that will enable both developers and players to trade device-agnostic digital content while still supporting the original creators.***

***Maybe GameStop will purchase Azerion Holdings, Genba’s parent company and a major videogames and advertising company in Europe.***

"Ethereum under governance attack: A selfish group of miners have created EGL token that seeks to artificially control the gas limit, against network’s design. Over 20% of the hashpower has signed up for this already","A token claiming to assist in ethereum governance has been created (EGL token - Ethereum Gas Limit) and around 20% of the hash power of ETH has already signed up for this and are collecting these tokens, which threatens to disrupt the governance process of Ethereum and manipulate gas limit in favour of miners. 

In regular process, the gas limit used on the network is voted on by miners in coordination w/ core devs. The miners can vote on the protocol’s gas limit. In regular course, the miners are incentivised to act in the best interests of the protocol and retain this governance. However, with proof of stake merge cutting miners out, they are now acting in selfish interest. 

However, EGL now seeks to bribe miners to tokenize & sell this control to the market instead, ignoring due process. Such a proposal will never pass EIP process, but now due to greedy miners this attempt at power grab is being played out. 

Miners are taking this step because of the upcoming proof of stake merge, that threatens to cut miners out of the picture. Hence, they are attempting to divest their control on the network in this fashion, by selling their governance out in collaboration with some rogue VC funds, and trying to seek rent on the governance process. 

The Ethereum team must make it clear that they don’t endorse this EGL project. People buying this in the market are just helping rouge miners cash out  and providing liquidity to bad actors.",1488.0,2021-08-21 12:35:19,0.92
After London,"It's been a short while since we're in London, let's see how everything goes and how EIP1559 is behaving by now.

The hard fork happened on Aug 5th 2021 on block #12965000. Generally speaking, everything went very well, there were no consensus issues found, the network is not congested and everything works as it was designed to. That's some really great news with such a complicated upgrade. 

Chain capacity increased by \~9% after London. There are 3 evenly split causes: (1) ice age delay, (2) pre-London blocks being not full, and (3) imperfections in the basefee adjustment formula. 

Since day 1 there was 67,671 ETH burned, an equivalence of $210,651,298 

This chart represents the % of 1559 transactions in each block. In the last 24h it exceeded 40%, which shows that users are slowly sending more & more 1559 transactions. ⬇️

As observerd legacy users don't overpay, their transactions are sent with a price close to basefee and if the basefee is stable they are included fast if not it takes more time for them to be included. 



London upgrade was the 1st step forward in Ethereum’s roadmap toward ETH2.0 and PoS and there are in fact many more upgrades to come with Altair and the merge expected to be next.

Genba: A Guess At GameStop's Secret Strategy And How It Will Revolutionize the Videogame Market,"This post lays out the steps that RC and the new GameStop team have taken in the past few months to achieve their strategic objectives.  It also identifies where the company is likely going, based on some key subdomains that went live in the past few months.

*A quick note:* there's a lot of derivative information here.  If you see a link or concept that you mentioned months ago, please accept my appreciation, even if you're not mentioned.  Feel free to claim recognition in the comments.

I published another post about a week ago (linked further down), explaining the various subdomains that GameStop uses.  If I did my job right, you now understand that **GameStop subdomains clearly describe the software, services, and technologies** that they use to deliver value and delight customers.  

This post builds on that understanding and expands into old and new GameStop operations.
I had to leave a lot of content out to keep this focused, but it's long anyway.

While this post is forward-looking, it could always be wrong.  ***First, never take (financial) advice from internet strangers.  Second, as the old Danish aphorism goes, “It is difficult to make predictions, especially about the future.”***  Feel free to make corrections in comments.

#CHEWY VS. GAMESTOP, KEEPING SCORE

We could measure success of the GameStop strategy if we had a measuring stick to use for comparison.  Since the current strategy has Ryan Cohen as the Chairman of the Board and the chair of GameStop’s Strategic Planning & Allocation Committee, it seems fair to measure GameStop’s transformation against RC’s other great accomplishment: Chewy.

**COMPARISONS:**

1) **Inception** &nbsp;  

- RC decides to go into the pet business after an epiphany following a planned jewelry company that would have launched at the end of 2010, probably around the Miami Beach Antique Jewelry and Watch Show, 15-17 October 2010.&nbsp;
- RC Ventures acquires a 13% stake in GameStop on 17 December 2020.&nbsp;

2) **Starting the business**&nbsp;

- Mr. Chewy internet domain launched sometime on or after 9 May 2011.  
- GameStop board reaches a deal to appoint RC, Alan Attal, and Jim Grube to the BOD on 11 January 2021.&nbsp;

3) **Re-branding**  

- Chewy.com domain launches not earlier than 30 August 2012.
- EB Games Canada announces re-branding to GameStop.ca on 28 July 2021.

4) **First-Round Funding**

- Chewy gains first-round funding of $15 million USD from Larry Cheng with Volition Capital in October 2013.
- GameStop gains “first-round funding” of $551 million USD by completing an at-the-market (ATM) share offering by 26 April 2021.

5) **First New Warehouse**

- Chewy leases a 400,000 square foot fulfillment center  in Mechanicsburg, Pennsylvania, in early 2014.  The warehouse was effective by August 2014.
- GameStop leases a 700,000 square foot fulfillment center in York, Pennsylvania (almost next door to Mechanicsburg) on 3 May 2021.  The warehouse held a hiring fair on 8 July 2021 and is operational.

6) **Second New Warehouse**

- Chewy opened another fulfillment center in McCarran, Nevada in 2014.  This was converted from an old Toys R Us warehouse.  McCarran is a suburb of greater Reno.
- GameStop announced a 530,000 square foot second fulfillment center in Reno, Nevada on 6 July 2021

7) **Additional Funding**

- In 2014, Chewy gained $30 million USD from its second round of VC funding and $41 million USD from its third round of VC funding.
- GameStop gained “second round funding” of $1.126 billion USD by completing an ATM share offering by 22 June 2021.

8) **Building the Dream Team**

- Throughout 2015-2018, Ryan Cohen recruited top talent for Chewy by contacting people through LinkedIn and conducting after-hours interviews.
- Between January and June 2021, GameStop assembled a strong executive team from leading eCommerce companies around the world.  

Key members in the transformation include:

- Alan Attal (the third member of Chewy and former COO, now on the GameStop BOD and Strategic Planning & Capital Allocation Committee), 
- Jim Grube (brought into Chewy in 2015 as CFO and now on the GameStop BOD and Strategic Planning & Capital Allocation Committee),
- Larry Cheng (Chewy’s first angel investor, now on the GameStop BOD),
- Kelli Durkin (brought into Chewy in 2015 as VP of Customer Service, now SVP for Customer Care at GameStop); I think she’s the reason for cards at Chewy and she’s doing the same for GameStop now,
- Neda Pacifico (VP of eCommerce for Chewy, now SVP of eCommerce for GameStop),
- Andrea Wolfe (VP of Marketing at Chewy, now VP of Brand at GameStop)

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

Let me break this down a bit more:

1. Chewy went from concept to implementation in about **7 months**. The RC Ventures version of GameStop went from concept to implementation in about **2 months**.&nbsp;

2. Chewy rebranded itself after about **15 months**. GameStop rebranded itself after about **6 months**.&nbsp;

3. Chewy gained its first capital injection after about **29 months**. The RC GameStop gained its first capital injection in less than **4 months**.

4. Chewy launched its first new warehouse in Pennsylvania after about **36 months**. The RC GameStop launched its first new warehouse in Pennsylvania after about **6 months**.

5. Chewy launched its second new warehouse in Nevada after about **36 months**. The RC GameStop launched its second new warehouse in Nevada after about **6 months**.

6. Chewy gained its second capital injection after about **36 months**. The RC GameStop gained its second capital injection after about **6 months**.

7. Chewy began building a world-class C-suite after about **48 months**. The RC GameStop built a world-class C-suite within **5 months**.

8. Chewy began innovating in customer care after about **48 months**. The RC GameStop began innovating in customer care within **4 months**.

&nbsp;

***Ryan Cohen has repeated his Chewy success within GameStop already.***

&nbsp;

With an established international infrastructure, existing brand equity, and faster access to capital for leading projects, he has **reduced the time needed to achieve change to only about 6 months compared to 48 months**.  He is moving 8x faster than he did the first time, using his personal ethics of extreme focus to deliver the kind of service that delights customers and retains them for life.  There is still more work needed to cement the gains in supply chain management, customer care, and omni-channel ease-of-use for GameStop customers, but the big parts are already in place.  Truly, this transformation is a world-class achievement.  **On this alone, GameStop shares are currently undervalued, especially if you consider that the Chewy timeline ended with the largest-ever purchase of an eCommerce company for $3.5 billion USD and -- after IPO -- Chewy is valued at $34 billion USD**.  Even without MOASS, that's what GameStop will look like by 2024.

#LET’S PLAY MONOPOLY, VIDEOGAMES EDITION

There’s a great YouTube video from a Stanford lecture series on creating a startup.  Peter Thiel, PayPal and Palantir founder, [presents a compelling explanation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oKjLVECMKA) for why “Competition is for Losers.”  His point is that a strong company creates value in a unique way – a way that no competitor can replicate.  A good company creates a “monopoly” in its industry.

In its 10-K form, filed at the end of the fiscal year, GameStop [identifies the companies that It believes are its competitors](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001326380/000132638021000032/gme-20210130.htm):

- Wal-Mart, Target, Best Buy, and Amazon in the U.S.
- Sony Microsoft, Nintendo, Media Markt, Saturn, FNAC, Carrefour, Auchan, and Amazon in Europe
- Wal-Mart and Best Buy in Canada
- JB HiFi, Big W, and Target in Australia

Looking at this list, I don’t see genuine competition.  Many of these companies are “we sell everything” companies; videogame sales are a small part of their overall revenue stream.  Videogame and console makers – Sony, Microsoft, and Nintendo – might sell their own products directly, but they mostly rely on other companies (like GameStop) for sales and distribution.  In the U.S., Best Buy is the closest apples-to-apples competitor, because it’s a brick-and-mortar retailer that focuses on electronics and media sales.  But even then, videogames are simply not a large enough part of Best Buy’s overall revenue compared to GameStop.

GameStop is a “monopoly” in its market.  It is the only major global retailer in its markets that delivers value to customers with a singular focus on videogames and gaming culture.

And GameStop is an important part of the videogames industry.  **Reggie Fils-Aim&#233;** (former President and COO of Nintendo of America) is a somewhat active Twitter user.  But when he sat on the GameStop board, he **sent only one tweet related to GameStop**:

>**The gaming industry needs a healthy and vibrant \@GameStop**. I look forward to being a part of \@GameStopCorp Board and helping to make this happen. https://t.co/pYWFGZ9XKj

&nbsp;

***GameStop is a critical part of the videogame industry’s ability to identify potential customers, gather information about trends and preferences, and distribute games and consoles to users worldwide.***

#EVEN IF I DIDN’T FINISH THE GAME, I LEARNED A LOT ALONG THE WAY

GameStop has acquired a variety of skills throughout its lifetime.  These were failed projects, but they gave GameStop insights into key aspects of the market.  Since GameStop is less than 20 years old as a corporation (I’m not including Babbage’s or EB Games prior to the GameStop incorporation in 2002), the company still retains institutional memory from these earlier ventures.

- **Kongregate**: GameStop acquired indie game developer Kongregate in 2010.  The site hosted a variety of web-based games.  It also had a software development kit to help indie developers build games for mobile devices and Steam.  GameStop sold Kongregate to Swedish company Modern Times Group in 2017.  I will never understand why Reddit forums filled with apes never jumped on the opportunity to have a tagline like, “A Place for GameStop Apes to Kongregate.”  Also, this company’s logo features ants.  Shoutout to our Korean brethren.
- **Jolt Online Gaming**: GameStop acquired Jolt in 2009.  This was another web site that delivered web-based games.  It also included game reviews and interviews.  The site closed in 2012.
- **Impulse**: This was basically a Steam clone that GameStop acquired in 2011.  Customers could purchase, download, and play games from an online digital marketplace.  The program was discontinued in 2014, and unfortunately customers no longer have access to any games they purchased on the service.  Strangely, GameStop has maintained the “Impulse Store” subdomain and it’s still current.
- **Spawn Labs**: GameStop acquired Spawn Labs and its [patent](https://patents.google.com/patent/US8998719B1/en) [portfolio](https://patents.google.com/patent/US9675877B2/en) in 2011 also.  Spawn Labs provided technology to stream video games from the cloud to any front-end console or computer.  Here’s a [good demo with bad production quality](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M86CLcPiK28). 
- **GS Mobile**: GameStop incorporated mobile phone sales into some of its U.S. stores, beginning in May 2012.  They partnered with AT&T as the mobile carrier for service.  The GameStop mobile phone carrier was branded as Spring Mobile, and it was the single largest AT&T wireless reseller at the time.  This part of GameStop was sold off in 2020 so the company could refocus on gaming and gaming culture.

&nbsp;

From all of these past failures, here are the skills that may still be resident within the collective consciousness of GameStop:

- **Web-based gaming**
- **Mobile gaming**
- **Indie game development and distribution**
- **Mobile networks and telephony**
- **Device-agnostic streaming video games**
- **Digital gaming marketplace**

&nbsp;

There’s are two other key features that GameStop brings to the videogames industry.  GameInformer magazine and PowerUp Rewards.

**GameInformer**, with over 10 million subscribers, is the fifth largest magazine circulation in the United States and (adding other countries) the **fourth largest magazine circulation in the world**.

**PowerUp Rewards**, GameStop’s in-store discount purchasing program, has **over 60 million members**.

&nbsp;

There’s a great [Freakonomics podcast interview with Jeff Immelt](https://freakonomics.com/podcast/jeff-immelt/), the former CEO of General Electric.  Immelt watched GE decline in value from the most profitable company in the world to a current valuation that’s only one quarter what it had when he took over as CEO in 2001.  In the interview, Immelt identifies what – for him – is the key driver of success for large companies in today’s markets:

>If you think about the conglomerates of today — I’m talking about Amazon and Alphabet — they have a technical foundation. I would say G.E. had, at least in the beginning of my career, our foundation was management practices. It’s not that that’s unimportant. But that wasn’t enduring, really. And I think when you look at Amazon, they are a dominant software company. And in some way, shape, or form, everything they do feeds off that. Google was a dominant A.I. company. Everything they do feeds off that, right? So I think if you want to be a conglomerate today, a technical foundation is a must.

GameStop is the sole “information technology” company for the videogames industry.

If you don’t already know, large companies generate a lot of revenue by collecting and selling information about your web surfing habits, purchasing habits, and overall demographic information.  This is the Information Technology that Jeff Immelt was talking about that makes Amazon and Alphabet such large companies today.  From Alexa and OK Google to your web searches to your subscription deliveries, [modern companies benefit from the knowledge they have that other companies want](https://www.pcmag.com/news/how-companies-turn-your-data-into-money).

> More identifying information can simply be purchased. ""Facebook is taking offline credit card data and mixing it with their site,"" Weinberg said, to illustrate the lack of transparency he sees in the data market. ""You wouldn't expect that. The bigger the data profile . . . the better you can be targeted. They have incentives to buy and combine extra data."" After our interview, it came to light that Google had penned a secret deal with MasterCard for data on offline spending habits.

Now, this article was written for an American audience.  Europoors at least benefit from some protection under GDPR.

If you’re offended that your personal information is being harvested, I feel like I’ve just awakened you from the Matrix.  This is how all large companies build profiles to develop more popular products, deliver more appealing marketing, and identify more affluent customers.  In fact, [Target can tell you when your teenage daughter accidentally became pregnant](https://www.forbes.com/sites/kashmirhill/2012/02/16/how-target-figured-out-a-teen-girl-was-pregnant-before-her-father-did/
).

Back in fall 2020, u/DeepFuckingValue noted the potential for a GameStop renovation to improve advertising revenue along with a move towards an “omni-channel” marketplace.  This was always part of the GameStop transformation.  Here’s a single example of his fundamentals-based thesis.

https://twitter.com/TheRoaringKitty/status/1325573568822915077

GameStop uses the company [Moveable Ink](https://movableink.com/product) to deliver a web site experience that is completely unique for each person who visits GameStop’s web sites.

The whole reason for turning GameStop stores into Pokemon Go gyms was so that GameStop could acquire mobile phone identifiers, correlated with Google accounts and Pokemon Go playing statistics, correlated with a customer’s GameStop purchase history, correlated with demographic and spending details that were purchased online for pennies on the dollar.  GameStop can use its cloud-based Tableau instance to provide rapid data visualization to infer key trends in customer preferences.  They will sell this information to Sony, Nintendo, and Microsoft (and perhaps the big game companies like Blizzard-Activision, Sega, or Epic) to create a templated profile for what a top-selling future game might look like.  Simultaneously, GameStop can use each Pokemon Go gym visit as a proxy for how many customers are visiting its brick-and-mortar operations.  This helps to show that GameStop’s retail storefronts are far from dead (as the Wall Street propagandists would have you believe).

&nbsp;

Okay, putting it all together:

***GameStop is transitioning from a brick-and-mortar focus towards a digital-first information technology company.  It has a variety of skills stored within its institutional memory, including web games, mobile phones, mobile apps, streaming gaming, and digital-download videogame distribution.  It has a proprietary database of over 60 million gamers that it combines with other demographic data to create the most valuable database of gamers in the world.  This gamer database, along with GameStop’s worldwide supply chain, makes it so indispensable that “The gaming industry needs a healthy and vibrant GameStop.”***

&nbsp;

But what if I told you that it’s going to get even better?

#NOW, FOR THE MOON SHOT

In my last post, I mentioned a company called **Genba Digital**.  I think they are directly connected to GameStop’s NFT infrastructure.

- ```nft.gamestop.com``` goes live 17 May 2021
- ```genba.gamestop.com``` was updated 17 May 2021
- ```powerpass.gamestop.com``` was updated 17 May 2021
- ```ipfs.nft.gamestop.com``` goes live 20 July 2021
- Ethereum’s London Hard Fork happened 4 August 2021

#####FIRST, NFT

In the post below, u/schismsaints lays out a great list of possible business uses for NFTs on the Ethereum blockchain.

https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/of20ou/a_deep_dive_into_nftgamestopcom/

>Possible Business Uses
>
>- In-store currency - GME Coin can be used as an in-store currency/reward system
>- Crypto swap/exchange - Partner with an established cryptocurrency company to facilitate listing and conversion/exchange between stablecoins such as USDC or miscellaneous established coins or altcoins, and GME specific tokens. Use a GME app to manage a crypto wallet and exchange between various tokens/coins/currencies.
>- NFT Collectibles - i.e. CryptoKitties, Gods Unchained, etc. Facilitate in-person trading (either in-store or via app to app trading) of digital items and collectibles between platforms.
>- Digital game licensing - revolutionize DRM by hosting a record of your game license on the blockchain
>- In-game item transfer/entitlement - Imagine if there was a way to trade/sell your CounterStrike skins in-person for cash, or exchange a cool knife skin for a new CryptoKitty

#####SECOND, IPFS

In the post below, u/hooper359 explains how IPFS works with the ERC-721 NFTs on the Ethereum blockchain.  From all I've seen, u/hooper359 was the first to identify the new IPFS subdomain for GameStop.

https://www.reddit.com/user/hooper359/comments/osr91k/new_ipfs_subdomain_possibly_for_a_digital_games/

There’s also a web site that provides details about what the Interplanetary File System (IPFS) is, how it works, and how to integrate it into existing blockchain systems.

https://docs.ipfs.io/

The key [features or proposed uses cases of IPFS](https://docs.ipfs.io/concepts/usage-ideas-examples/) that are relevant to this conversation are:


- Proof of Ownership
- Blockchain-powered online commerce
- Distributed package managers (DPM) and content delivery networks (CDN)
- Version control
- Selling digital files
- Serverless online gaming

#####THIRD, GENBA

Now, let’s take a look at Genba.

My last post was a look at GameStop subdomains.  

https://www.reddit.com/r/GMEJungle/comments/p2rodz/a_review_of_gamestop_subdomains/

That post was set up to preface this post by highlighting one key feature of GameStop’s subdomains.

**GameStop subdomains describe the branded services or products that GameStop uses in its network infrastructure.**

GameStop has a subdomain ```genba.gamestop.com```.  It first appeared in early 2020, but it was **last refreshed on 17 May 2021 at the same time the NFT subdomain appeared**.

&nbsp;

***The name Genba is fairly unique.***

&nbsp;

If you’re familiar with “Lean” concepts in manufacturing and supply chain management, *Gemba* is a fairly well-known term.  It roughly translates to the old business cliché of “Management By Walking Around” (MBWA).  It requires leaders in organizations to actually “go and see for themselves” what’s happening in the operations center, warehouses, or retail front lines of the company.

But the Lean version of *Gemba* is always spelled with the letter “**M**” like in G**M**E, almost never spelled with an “**N**” like in **N**aked Shorts.  **[Here’s a blog post](http://artoflean.com/index.php/2016/03/25/is-it-genba-or-gemba/) by a Lean expert explaining the difference in spelling**.

If you search for the **Genba-with-an-N** spelling, only two companies come up.  

One is a Lean consultancy in Washington state.  It was incorporated in Delaware, but it doesn’t use the same registered agent that GameStop uses.  Also, what does walking around the operations center have to do with videogames?

***The second company is Genba Digital.***

Genba Digital is a startup in Leamington Spa, outside of Birmingham, England.  They have offices in London, England; Eindhoven, Netherlands; and Los Angeles, California. They started in 2015 with investment from UK and EU venture-capital firms.  

https://genbadigital.com/

https://pitchbook.com/profiles/company/158919-13

Here’s how they describe themselves:

>Developer of a cloud-based digital logistics platform designed to bridge the gap between publishers and resellers in the gaming industry on a global basis. The company's platform is API driven and fully-automated that eliminates the operational and technical logistics involved with publishing and selling digital content, enabling game publishers to avail automatic, secure delivery of activation keys, official publisher metadata and videos in multiple languages.

Genba Digital lists over 200 partnerships on its web site, including:

- Amazon
- Ubisoft
- Disney
- Square Enix
- Epic Games
- Konami
- 2K
- Sega
- Capcom
- Take 2 Interactive
- Paradox Interactive
- Hello Games
- Gamesplanet
- Games Republic
- 505 Games
- Codemasters
- Curve Digital
- Team 17
- Hello Games
- Voidu

Sony [created Genba back in 2013](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/sony-dadc-launches-genba-digital-games-supply-chain--distribution-services-210543551.html).  Their DADC (Digital Audio Disc Corporation) New Media Solutions division [hired Kwiboo to develop the initial concept](https://www.kwiboo.com/case-studies/genba-web_platform/).  In their site, they call Genba “***the world’s first digital supply chain management platform for the games industry. Linking games publishers with game eTailers, on a global scale, to drive efficiencies in relationship management, content distribution and consistent pricing.***”

On 18 May 2021 Genba Digital was acquired by Azerion Holdings.  **This is exactly one day after GameStop launched its NFT domain and refreshed its Genba domain**.  [According to the UK’s Companies House website](https://find-and-update.company-information.service.gov.uk/company/09491005/filing-history), Erol Erturk and Umut Akpinar were appointed as directors of the company.  Umut Akpinar is the [Founder and CEO of Azerion](https://www.linkedin.com/in/umutakpinar/), a videogames company based out of Amsterdam, Netherlands.  Erol Erturk is the [Executive Vice President of Content and Strategic Partnerships](https://www.pocketgamer.biz/news/72583/azerion-fully-acquires-spil-games/) for Azerion.

https://azerion-investors.com/reports/

https://azerion.com/companies

I don’t want to get lost explaining Azerion, but there’s one last possibility I want to touch on.  Azerion is a relatively large European gaming and advertising company.  Their gross profit in 2020 was €70 million EUR.  ***If GameStop wanted to acquire Azerion, the company is not too large to be reasonably purchased for a price within the available cash GameStop is holding***.  This would also be a way to re-enter the northern European markets after closing stores in 2020.

With the Genba subdomain, it’s clear that GameStop has a relationship with Genba Digital, but it’s not clear whether this is a business partnership or a pending acquisition.  There's not enough info to clarify, so let’s just keep looking at the potential that Genba Digital brings to GameStop.

**Genba Digital’s platform helps to solve some of the major problems with videogame distribution globally.**

One challenge that games developers face is [grey market key reselling](https://advanced-television.com/2019/12/04/genba-digital-continues-to-evolve-the-way-video-games-are-sold-online/).  Users who are finished playing a game resell their game keys online, cutting out the company’s profits for digital distribution.  Genba Digital [partnered with Ubisoft in May 2019](https://www.pcgamer.com/ubisoft-is-trying-to-wipe-out-key-reselling-with-silent-key-activation/) to implement a process they called “Silent Key Activation,” or SKA.  The Genba Digital platform provides the digital license keys silently to the user’s platform, so the user never sees the actual license key and can’t resell it on the grey market.

This is less of an issue in the United States or Europe, where users are playing on their personal devices – consoles, mobile phone, desktop gaming rigs.  But in Asia, and especially China, most players access their favorite titles through cyber cafes.  In this case, the software developer sells a license to a user based on an account login.  This makes grey-market key reselling a bigger issue for these companies to capture revenue.

One last speculation about *Genba*.  Remember when RC [tweeted his visit](https://mobile.twitter.com/ryancohen/status/1381829698263654401) to the GameStop in Culver City, California?  Back then, there was a lot of speculation that GameStop might merge with Super League Gaming (SLGG) because they’re based out of Los Angeles.  If you notice the Genba description above, they also have offices in Los Angeles.  The tweet was on 13 April, just a little over one month before the NFT and Genba domains launched and Azerion acquired Genba Digital.  I know I’m speculating, but I wonder whether Azerion is secretly buying up gaming companies on behalf of GameStop, like that [scene at the end of Batman Begins](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vw4KaI6dpBo) when Dr. Michael Burry pulls a fast one on Roy Batty and buys Wayne Enterprises without anyone knowing.

#POWERS COMBINED

Let’s bring all of these parts together, to make the big picture clear.

- GameStop creates an **NFT** framework to identify ownership.
- GameStop uses **IPFS** technology to identify unique ownership of videogame licenses, downloadable content, in-game items, in-game currency, and digital collectibles related to gaming and pop culture.
- GameStop uses the **Genba** platform to create a seamless transactional marketplace for all customers.
- Customers can move personal transactions back into the White Market, conducting secondary sales through GameStop’s NFT-driven digital marketplace.
- Original developers receive transactional royalties in perpetuity from all trades related to their intellectual property; GameStop receives a fractional percent of all revenue generated in its marketplace.
- Fans and independent artists create specialty characters, costumes, and items that can be sold in a secondary marketplace, like Etsy for videogames.
- Software developers can create limited-edition videogames with inherent value based on rarity, similar to how [Wu Tang Clan created a single copy of its “Once In Shaolin” album](https://www.bloomberg.com/features/2015-martin-shkreli-wu-tang-clan-album/).
- GameStop creates a secondary digital market for “used” digital games and collectibles, exactly how it has done with physical game media and collectibles in its brick-and-mortar stores.
- Every transaction will be written publicly to the blockchain.  But each account will remain anonymously hidden as a hexadecimal hash code.  But **by linking the blockchain accounts to GameStop PowerUp Rewards accounts or PowerPass accounts, GameStop will have a monopoly on the true identities of its marketplace users**.  This will give GameStop a unique advantage in providing customer data to software developers around the world.

It might be better though if [GameStop’s Principal Engineer explains how this will work](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/magic-gathering-multiverse-metaverse-jordan-holberg/).

&nbsp;

***GameStop is about to completely change the videogame industry.***

#THE FINAL BOSS

One of the great challenges of cryptocurrency adoption is that it can take forever to make a transaction.  Once you agree with another person to give away your cryptocurrency in exchange for some material object or service, the network still has to validate that you have the currency available and that the exchange properly moved that currency to the correct recipient.  This can take several minutes or several hours, depending on the condition of the network at the time.

In contrast, you can flash your mobile phone at a near-field communication (NFC) receiver and buy your Starbucks coffee in seconds.  Even if you use your chip-and-pin card to make a purchase, the whole transaction takes less than a minute.  EVERY. SINGLE. TIME.

This is because companies like Visa have built a very large infrastructure to make sure that money moves quickly throughout the world.  The speed of the network is measured in “transactions per second” (TPS).  **Visa, with a 20,000 TPS network speed, is the Goliath against which cryptocurrency developers compare themselves**. (People argue about what the true TPS is for Visa, I’m ready for the comments…)

There is an equivalently monolithic goliath for digital videogame transactions.  

&nbsp;

**It’s Steam.**

&nbsp;

When GameStop was trying to deliver games digitally with its Impulse service at 10% of the U.S. market, Steam was crushing GameStop with 70% of the U.S. market.  Steam is the largest and most popular digital game distribution platform worldwide, with over 30,000 titles available for download.  Nearly half of all software developers sell their games on Steam.  

But developers don’t want to sell on Steam, or Apple’s App Store, or Google Play.  These companies take a 30% haircut on every single transaction in their markets.  This is why Epic Games took Apple to the U.S. Supreme Court.

***Building a cohesive and seamless videogame market that can compete with Steam is the true final boss that GameStop must face***.  But to achieve success while also giving *Power to the Players*, *Power to the Creators*, and *Power to the Collectors*, without gouging developers with a 30% cut on every transaction – that will be what truly makes GameStop into the clear market dominator.

#TA;DR

***Ryan Cohen has achieved for GameStop what he did for Chewy, but eight times faster.***

***Genba Digital is a British company that GameStop seems to be doing business with.***

***Combining Genba’s seamless digital videogame marketplace with non-fungible tokens (NFTs) on the blockchain and the Interplanetary File System (IPFS) for digital rights management will create a completely unique cloud-based videogame marketplace that will enable both developers and players to trade device-agnostic digital content while still supporting the original creators.***

***Maybe GameStop will purchase Azerion Holdings, Genba’s parent company and a major videogames and advertising company in Europe.***

&nbsp;

Thanks for playing along with me as I entertained this speculative fan-fiction.

Genba: A Guess At GameStop's Secret Strategy And How It Will Revolutionize the Videogame Market,"This post lays out the steps that RC and the new GameStop team have taken in the past few months to achieve their strategic objectives.  It also identifies where the company is likely going, based on some key subdomains that went live in the past few months.

*A quick note:* there's a lot of derivative information here.  If you see a link or concept that you mentioned months ago, please accept my appreciation, even if you're not mentioned.  Feel free to claim recognition in the comments.

I published another post about a week ago (linked further down), explaining the various subdomains that GameStop uses.  If I did my job right, you now understand that **GameStop subdomains clearly describe the software, services, and technologies** that they use to deliver value and delight customers.  

This post builds on that understanding and expands into old and new GameStop operations.
I had to leave a lot of content out to keep this focused, but it's long anyway.

While this post is forward-looking, it could always be wrong.  ***First, never take (financial) advice from internet strangers.  Second, as the old Danish aphorism goes, “It is difficult to make predictions, especially about the future.”***  Feel free to make corrections in comments.

#CHEWY VS. GAMESTOP, KEEPING SCORE

We could measure success of the GameStop strategy if we had a measuring stick to use for comparison.  Since the current strategy has Ryan Cohen as the Chairman of the Board and the chair of GameStop’s Strategic Planning & Allocation Committee, it seems fair to measure GameStop’s transformation against RC’s other great accomplishment: Chewy.

*\[Mobile users scroll right for second column\]*

**COMPARISONS:**

1) **Inception** &nbsp;  

- RC decides to go into the pet business after an epiphany following a planned jewelry company that would have launched at the end of 2010, probably around the Miami Beach Antique Jewelry and Watch Show, 15-17 October 2010.&nbsp;
- RC Ventures acquires a 13% stake in GameStop on 17 December 2020.&nbsp;

2) **Starting the business**&nbsp;

- Mr. Chewy internet domain launched sometime on or after 9 May 2011.  
- GameStop board reaches a deal to appoint RC, Alan Attal, and Jim Grube to the BOD on 11 January 2021.&nbsp;

3) **Re-branding**  

- Chewy.com domain launches not earlier than 30 August 2012.
- EB Games Canada announces re-branding to GameStop.ca on 28 July 2021.

4) **First-Round Funding**

- Chewy gains first-round funding of $15 million USD from Larry Cheng with Volition Capital in October 2013.
- GameStop gains “first-round funding” of $551 million USD by completing an at-the-market (ATM) share offering by 26 April 2021.

5) **First New Warehouse**

- Chewy leases a 400,000 square foot fulfillment center  in Mechanicsburg, Pennsylvania, in early 2014.  The warehouse was effective by August 2014.
- GameStop leases a 700,000 square foot fulfillment center in York, Pennsylvania (almost next door to Mechanicsburg) on 3 May 2021.  The warehouse held a hiring fair on 8 July 2021 and is operational.

6) **Second New Warehouse**

- Chewy opened another fulfillment center in McCarran, Nevada in 2014.  This was converted from an old Toys R Us warehouse.  McCarran is a suburb of greater Reno.
- GameStop announced a 530,000 square foot second fulfillment center in Reno, Nevada on 6 July 2021

7) **Additional Funding**

- In 2014, Chewy gained $30 million USD from its second round of VC funding and $41 million USD from its third round of VC funding.
- GameStop gained “second round funding” of $1.126 billion USD by completing an ATM share offering by 22 June 2021.

8) **Building the Dream Team**

- Throughout 2015-2018, Ryan Cohen recruited top talent for Chewy by contacting people through LinkedIn and conducting after-hours interviews.
- Between January and June 2021, GameStop assembled a strong executive team from leading eCommerce companies around the world.  

Key members in the transformation include:

- Alan Attal (the third member of Chewy and former COO, now on the GameStop BOD and Strategic Planning & Capital Allocation Committee), 
- Jim Grube (brought into Chewy in 2015 as CFO and now on the GameStop BOD and Strategic Planning & Capital Allocation Committee),
- Larry Cheng (Chewy’s first angel investor, now on the GameStop BOD),
- Kelli Durkin (brought into Chewy in 2015 as VP of Customer Service, now SVP for Customer Care at GameStop); I think she’s the reason for cards at Chewy and she’s doing the same for GameStop now,
- Neda Pacifico (VP of eCommerce for Chewy, now SVP of eCommerce for GameStop),
- Andrea Wolfe (VP of Marketing at Chewy, now VP of Brand at GameStop)

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

Let me break this down a bit more:

1. Chewy went from concept to implementation in about **7 months**. The RC Ventures version of GameStop went from concept to implementation in about **2 months**.&nbsp;

2. Chewy rebranded itself after about **15 months**. GameStop rebranded itself after about **6 months**.&nbsp;

3. Chewy gained its first capital injection after about **29 months**. The RC GameStop gained its first capital injection in less than **4 months**.

4. Chewy launched its first new warehouse in Pennsylvania after about **36 months**. The RC GameStop launched its first new warehouse in Pennsylvania after about **6 months**.

5. Chewy launched its second new warehouse in Nevada after about **36 months**. The RC GameStop launched its second new warehouse in Nevada after about **6 months**.

6. Chewy gained its second capital injection after about **36 months**. The RC GameStop gained its second capital injection after about **6 months**.

7. Chewy began building a world-class C-suite after about **48 months**. The RC GameStop built a world-class C-suite within **5 months**.

8. Chewy began innovating in customer care after about **48 months**. The RC GameStop began innovating in customer care within **4 months**.

&nbsp;

***Ryan Cohen has repeated his Chewy success within GameStop already.***

&nbsp;

With an established international infrastructure, existing brand equity, and faster access to capital for leading projects, he has **reduced the time needed to achieve change to only about 6 months compared to 48 months**.  He is moving 8x faster than he did the first time, using his personal ethics of extreme focus to deliver the kind of service that delights customers and retains them for life.  There is still more work needed to cement the gains in supply chain management, customer care, and omni-channel ease-of-use for GameStop customers, but the big parts are already in place.  Truly, this transformation is a world-class achievement.  **On this alone, GameStop shares are currently undervalued, especially if you consider that the Chewy timeline ended with the largest-ever purchase of an eCommerce company for $3.5 billion USD and -- after IPO -- Chewy is valued at $34 billion USD**.  Even without MOASS, that's what GameStop will look like by 2024.

#LET’S PLAY MONOPOLY, VIDEOGAMES EDITION

There’s a great YouTube video from a Stanford lecture series on creating a startup.  Peter Thiel, PayPal and Palantir founder, [presents a compelling explanation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oKjLVECMKA) for why “Competition is for Losers.”  His point is that a strong company creates value in a unique way – a way that no competitor can replicate.  A good company creates a “monopoly” in its industry.

In its 10-K form, filed at the end of the fiscal year, GameStop [identifies the companies that It believes are its competitors](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001326380/000132638021000032/gme-20210130.htm):

- Wal-Mart, Target, Best Buy, and Amazon in the U.S.
- Sony Microsoft, Nintendo, Media Markt, Saturn, FNAC, Carrefour, Auchan, and Amazon in Europe
- Wal-Mart and Best Buy in Canada
- JB HiFi, Big W, and Target in Australia

Looking at this list, I don’t see genuine competition.  Many of these companies are “we sell everything” companies; videogame sales are a small part of their overall revenue stream.  Videogame and console makers – Sony, Microsoft, and Nintendo – might sell their own products directly, but they mostly rely on other companies (like GameStop) for sales and distribution.  In the U.S., Best Buy is the closest apples-to-apples competitor, because it’s a brick-and-mortar retailer that focuses on electronics and media sales.  But even then, videogames are simply not a large enough part of Best Buy’s overall revenue compared to GameStop.

GameStop is a “monopoly” in its market.  It is the only major global retailer in its markets that delivers value to customers with a singular focus on videogames and gaming culture.

And GameStop is an important part of the videogames industry.  **Reggie Fils-Aim&#233;** (former President and COO of Nintendo of America) is a somewhat active Twitter user.  But when he sat on the GameStop board, he **sent only one tweet related to GameStop**:

>**The gaming industry needs a healthy and vibrant \@GameStop**. I look forward to being a part of \@GameStopCorp Board and helping to make this happen. https://t.co/pYWFGZ9XKj

&nbsp;

***GameStop is a critical part of the videogame industry’s ability to identify potential customers, gather information about trends and preferences, and distribute games and consoles to users worldwide.***

#EVEN IF I DIDN’T FINISH THE GAME, I LEARNED A LOT ALONG THE WAY

GameStop has acquired a variety of skills throughout its lifetime.  These were failed projects, but they gave GameStop insights into key aspects of the market.  Since GameStop is less than 20 years old as a corporation (I’m not including Babbage’s or EB Games prior to the GameStop incorporation in 2002), the company still retains institutional memory from these earlier ventures.

- **Kongregate**: GameStop acquired indie game developer Kongregate in 2010.  The site hosted a variety of web-based games.  It also had a software development kit to help indie developers build games for mobile devices and Steam.  GameStop sold Kongregate to Swedish company Modern Times Group in 2017.  I will never understand why Reddit forums filled with apes never jumped on the opportunity to have a tagline like, “A Place for GameStop Apes to Kongregate.”  Also, this company’s logo features ants.  Shoutout to our Korean brethren.
- **Jolt Online Gaming**: GameStop acquired Jolt in 2009.  This was another web site that delivered web-based games.  It also included game reviews and interviews.  The site closed in 2012.
- **Impulse**: This was basically a Steam clone that GameStop acquired in 2011.  Customers could purchase, download, and play games from an online digital marketplace.  The program was discontinued in 2014, and unfortunately customers no longer have access to any games they purchased on the service.  Strangely, GameStop has maintained the “Impulse Store” subdomain and it’s still current.
- **Spawn Labs**: GameStop acquired Spawn Labs and its [patent](https://patents.google.com/patent/US8998719B1/en) [portfolio](https://patents.google.com/patent/US9675877B2/en) in 2011 also.  Spawn Labs provided technology to stream video games from the cloud to any front-end console or computer.  Here’s a [good demo with bad production quality](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M86CLcPiK28). 
- **GS Mobile**: GameStop incorporated mobile phone sales into some of its U.S. stores, beginning in May 2012.  They partnered with AT&T as the mobile carrier for service.  The GameStop mobile phone carrier was branded as Spring Mobile, and it was the single largest AT&T wireless reseller at the time.  This part of GameStop was sold off in 2020 so the company could refocus on gaming and gaming culture.

&nbsp;

From all of these past failures, here are the skills that may still be resident within the collective consciousness of GameStop:

- **Web-based gaming**
- **Mobile gaming**
- **Indie game development and distribution**
- **Mobile networks and telephony**
- **Device-agnostic streaming video games**
- **Digital gaming marketplace**

&nbsp;

There’s are two other key features that GameStop brings to the videogames industry.  GameInformer magazine and PowerUp Rewards.

**GameInformer**, with over 10 million subscribers, is the fifth largest magazine circulation in the United States and (adding other countries) the **fourth largest magazine circulation in the world**.

**PowerUp Rewards**, GameStop’s in-store discount purchasing program, has **over 60 million members**.

&nbsp;

There’s a great [Freakonomics podcast interview with Jeff Immelt](https://freakonomics.com/podcast/jeff-immelt/), the former CEO of General Electric.  Immelt watched GE decline in value from the most profitable company in the world to a current valuation that’s only one quarter what it had when he took over as CEO in 2001.  In the interview, Immelt identifies what – for him – is the key driver of success for large companies in today’s markets:

>If you think about the conglomerates of today — I’m talking about Amazon and Alphabet — they have a technical foundation. I would say G.E. had, at least in the beginning of my career, our foundation was management practices. It’s not that that’s unimportant. But that wasn’t enduring, really. And I think when you look at Amazon, they are a dominant software company. And in some way, shape, or form, everything they do feeds off that. Google was a dominant A.I. company. Everything they do feeds off that, right? So I think if you want to be a conglomerate today, a technical foundation is a must.

GameStop is the sole “information technology” company for the videogames industry.

https://www.forbes.com/sites/paularosenblum/2015/09/14/gamestop-uses-data-and-customer-experience-to-survive-and-thrive-in-stores-and-online/

If you don’t already know, large companies generate a lot of revenue by collecting and selling information about your web surfing habits, purchasing habits, and overall demographic information.  This is the Information Technology that Jeff Immelt was talking about that makes Amazon and Alphabet such large companies today.  From Alexa and OK Google to your web searches to your subscription deliveries, [modern companies benefit from the knowledge they have that other companies want](https://www.pcmag.com/news/how-companies-turn-your-data-into-money).

> More identifying information can simply be purchased. ""Facebook is taking offline credit card data and mixing it with their site,"" Weinberg said, to illustrate the lack of transparency he sees in the data market. ""You wouldn't expect that. The bigger the data profile . . . the better you can be targeted. They have incentives to buy and combine extra data."" After our interview, it came to light that Google had penned a secret deal with MasterCard for data on offline spending habits.

Now, this article was written for an American audience.  Europoors at least benefit from some protection under GDPR.

If you’re offended that your personal information is being harvested, I feel like I’ve just awakened you from the Matrix.  This is how all large companies build profiles to develop more popular products, deliver more appealing marketing, and identify more affluent customers.  In fact, [Target can tell you when your teenage daughter accidentally became pregnant](https://www.forbes.com/sites/kashmirhill/2012/02/16/how-target-figured-out-a-teen-girl-was-pregnant-before-her-father-did/
).

Back in fall 2020, u/DeepFuckingValue noted the potential for a GameStop renovation to improve advertising revenue along with a move towards an “omni-channel” marketplace.  This was always part of the GameStop transformation.  Here’s a single example of his fundamentals-based thesis.

https://twitter.com/TheRoaringKitty/status/1325573568822915077

GameStop uses the company [Moveable Ink](https://movableink.com/product) to deliver a web site experience that is completely unique for each person who visits GameStop’s web sites.

The whole reason for turning GameStop stores into Pokemon Go gyms was so that GameStop could acquire mobile phone identifiers, correlated with Google accounts and Pokemon Go playing statistics, correlated with a customer’s GameStop purchase history, correlated with demographic and spending details that were purchased online for pennies on the dollar.  GameStop can use its cloud-based Tableau instance to provide rapid data visualization to infer key trends in customer preferences.  They will sell this information to Sony, Nintendo, and Microsoft (and perhaps the big game companies like Blizzard-Activision, Sega, or Epic) to create a templated profile for what a top-selling future game might look like.  Simultaneously, GameStop can use each Pokemon Go gym visit as a proxy for how many customers are visiting its brick-and-mortar operations.  This helps to show that GameStop’s retail storefronts are far from dead (as the Wall Street propagandists would have you believe).

&nbsp;

Okay, putting it all together:

***GameStop is transitioning from a brick-and-mortar focus towards a digital-first information technology company.  It has a variety of skills stored within its institutional memory, including web games, mobile phones, mobile apps, streaming gaming, and digital-download videogame distribution.  It has a proprietary database of over 60 million gamers that it combines with other demographic data to create the most valuable database of gamers in the world.  This gamer database, along with GameStop’s worldwide supply chain, makes it so indispensable that “The gaming industry needs a healthy and vibrant GameStop.”***

&nbsp;

But what if I told you that it’s going to get even better?

#NOW, FOR THE MOON SHOT

In my last post, I mentioned a company called **Genba Digital**.  I think they are directly connected to GameStop’s NFT infrastructure.

- ```nft.gamestop.com``` goes live 17 May 2021
- ```genba.gamestop.com``` was updated 17 May 2021
- ```powerpass.gamestop.com``` was updated 17 May 2021
- ```ipfs.nft.gamestop.com``` goes live 20 July 2021
- Ethereum’s London Hard Fork happened 4 August 2021

#####FIRST, NFT

In the post below, u/schismsaints lays out a great list of possible business uses for NFTs on the Ethereum blockchain.

https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/of20ou/a_deep_dive_into_nftgamestopcom/

>Possible Business Uses
>
>- In-store currency - GME Coin can be used as an in-store currency/reward system
>- Crypto swap/exchange - Partner with an established cryptocurrency company to facilitate listing and conversion/exchange between stablecoins such as USDC or miscellaneous established coins or altcoins, and GME specific tokens. Use a GME app to manage a crypto wallet and exchange between various tokens/coins/currencies.
>- NFT Collectibles - i.e. CryptoKitties, Gods Unchained, etc. Facilitate in-person trading (either in-store or via app to app trading) of digital items and collectibles between platforms.
>- Digital game licensing - revolutionize DRM by hosting a record of your game license on the blockchain
>- In-game item transfer/entitlement - Imagine if there was a way to trade/sell your CounterStrike skins in-person for cash, or exchange a cool knife skin for a new CryptoKitty

#####SECOND, IPFS

In the post below, u/hooper359 explains how IPFS works with the ERC-721 NFTs on the Ethereum blockchain.  From all I've seen, u/hooper359 was the first to identify the new IPFS subdomain for GameStop.

https://www.reddit.com/user/hooper359/comments/osr91k/new_ipfs_subdomain_possibly_for_a_digital_games/

There’s also a web site that provides details about what the Interplanetary File System (IPFS) is, how it works, and how to integrate it into existing blockchain systems.

https://docs.ipfs.io/

The key [features or proposed uses cases of IPFS](https://docs.ipfs.io/concepts/usage-ideas-examples/) that are relevant to this conversation are:


- Proof of Ownership
- Blockchain-powered online commerce
- Distributed package managers (DPM) and content delivery networks (CDN)
- Version control
- Selling digital files
- Serverless online gaming

#####THIRD, GENBA

Now, let’s take a look at Genba.

My last post was a look at GameStop subdomains.  

https://www.reddit.com/r/DDintoGME/comments/p2rmgh/a_review_of_gamestop_subdomains/

That post was set up to preface this post by highlighting one key feature of GameStop’s subdomains.

**GameStop subdomains describe the branded services or products that GameStop uses in its network infrastructure.**

GameStop has a subdomain ```genba.gamestop.com```.  It first appeared in early 2020, but it was **last refreshed on 17 May 2021 at the same time the NFT subdomain appeared**.

&nbsp;

***The name Genba is fairly unique.***

&nbsp;

If you’re familiar with “Lean” concepts in manufacturing and supply chain management, *Gemba* is a fairly well-known term.  It roughly translates to the old business cliché of “Management By Walking Around” (MBWA).  It requires leaders in organizations to actually “go and see for themselves” what’s happening in the operations center, warehouses, or retail front lines of the company.

But the Lean version of *Gemba* is always spelled with the letter “**M**” like in G**M**E, almost never spelled with an “**N**” like in **N**aked Shorts.  **[Here’s a blog post](http://artoflean.com/index.php/2016/03/25/is-it-genba-or-gemba/) by a Lean expert explaining the difference in spelling**.

If you search for the **Genba-with-an-N** spelling, only two companies come up.  

One is a Lean consultancy in Washington state.  It was incorporated in Delaware, but it doesn’t use the same registered agent that GameStop uses.  Also, what does walking around the operations center have to do with videogames?

***The second company is Genba Digital.***

Genba Digital is a startup in Leamington Spa, outside of Birmingham, England.  They have offices in London, England; Eindhoven, Netherlands; and Los Angeles, California. They started in 2015 with investment from UK and EU venture-capital firms.  

https://genbadigital.com/

https://pitchbook.com/profiles/company/158919-13

Here’s how they describe themselves:

>Developer of a cloud-based digital logistics platform designed to bridge the gap between publishers and resellers in the gaming industry on a global basis. The company's platform is API driven and fully-automated that eliminates the operational and technical logistics involved with publishing and selling digital content, enabling game publishers to avail automatic, secure delivery of activation keys, official publisher metadata and videos in multiple languages.

Genba Digital lists over 200 partnerships on its web site, including:

- Amazon
- Ubisoft
- Disney
- Square Enix
- Epic Games
- Konami
- 2K
- Sega
- Capcom
- Take 2 Interactive
- Paradox Interactive
- Hello Games
- Gamesplanet
- Games Republic
- 505 Games
- Codemasters
- Curve Digital
- Team 17
- Hello Games
- Voidu

Sony [created Genba back in 2013](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/sony-dadc-launches-genba-digital-games-supply-chain--distribution-services-210543551.html).  Their DADC (Digital Audio Disc Corporation) New Media Solutions division [hired Kwiboo to develop the initial concept](https://www.kwiboo.com/case-studies/genba-web_platform/).  In their site, they call Genba “***the world’s first digital supply chain management platform for the games industry. Linking games publishers with game eTailers, on a global scale, to drive efficiencies in relationship management, content distribution and consistent pricing.***”

On 18 May 2021 Genba Digital was acquired by Azerion Holdings.  **This is exactly one day after GameStop launched its NFT domain and refreshed its Genba domain**.  [According to the UK’s Companies House website](https://find-and-update.company-information.service.gov.uk/company/09491005/filing-history), Erol Erturk and Umut Akpinar were appointed as directors of the company.  Umut Akpinar is the [Founder and CEO of Azerion](https://www.linkedin.com/in/umutakpinar/), a videogames company based out of Amsterdam, Netherlands.  Erol Erturk is the [Executive Vice President of Content and Strategic Partnerships](https://www.pocketgamer.biz/news/72583/azerion-fully-acquires-spil-games/) for Azerion.

https://azerion-investors.com/reports/

https://azerion.com/companies

I don’t want to get lost explaining Azerion, but there’s one last possibility I want to touch on.  Azerion is a relatively large European gaming and advertising company.  Their gross profit in 2020 was €70 million EUR.  ***If GameStop wanted to acquire Azerion, the company is not too large to be reasonably purchased for a price within the available cash GameStop is holding***.  This would also be a way to re-enter the northern European markets after closing stores in 2020.

With the Genba subdomain, it’s clear that GameStop has a relationship with Genba Digital, but it’s not clear whether this is a business partnership or a pending acquisition.  There's not enough info to clarify, so let’s just keep looking at the potential that Genba Digital brings to GameStop.

**Genba Digital’s platform helps to solve some of the major problems with videogame distribution globally.**

One challenge that games developers face is [grey market key reselling](https://advanced-television.com/2019/12/04/genba-digital-continues-to-evolve-the-way-video-games-are-sold-online/).  Users who are finished playing a game resell their game keys online, cutting out the company’s profits for digital distribution.  Genba Digital [partnered with Ubisoft in May 2019](https://www.pcgamer.com/ubisoft-is-trying-to-wipe-out-key-reselling-with-silent-key-activation/) to implement a process they called “Silent Key Activation,” or SKA.  The Genba Digital platform provides the digital license keys silently to the user’s platform, so the user never sees the actual license key and can’t resell it on the grey market.

This is less of an issue in the United States or Europe, where users are playing on their personal devices – consoles, mobile phone, desktop gaming rigs.  But in Asia, and especially China, most players access their favorite titles through cyber cafes.  In this case, the software developer sells a license to a user based on an account login.  This makes grey-market key reselling a bigger issue for these companies to capture revenue.

One last speculation about *Genba*.  Remember when RC [tweeted his visit](https://mobile.twitter.com/ryancohen/status/1381829698263654401) to the GameStop in Culver City, California?  Back then, there was a lot of speculation that GameStop might merge with Super League Gaming (SLGG) because they’re based out of Los Angeles.  If you notice the Genba description above, they also have offices in Los Angeles.  The tweet was on 13 April, just a little over one month before the NFT and Genba domains launched and Azerion acquired Genba Digital.  I know I’m speculating, but I wonder whether Azerion is secretly buying up gaming companies on behalf of GameStop, like that [scene at the end of Batman Begins](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vw4KaI6dpBo) when Dr. Michael Burry pulls a fast one on Roy Batty and buys Wayne Enterprises without anyone knowing.

#POWERS COMBINED

Let’s bring all of these parts together, to make the big picture clear.

- GameStop creates an **NFT** framework to identify ownership.
- GameStop uses **IPFS** technology to identify unique ownership of videogame licenses, downloadable content, in-game items, in-game currency, and digital collectibles related to gaming and pop culture.
- GameStop uses the **Genba** platform to create a seamless transactional marketplace for all customers.
- Customers can move personal transactions back into the White Market, conducting secondary sales through GameStop’s NFT-driven digital marketplace.
- Original developers receive transactional royalties in perpetuity from all trades related to their intellectual property; GameStop receives a fractional percent of all revenue generated in its marketplace.
- Fans and independent artists create specialty characters, costumes, and items that can be sold in a secondary marketplace, like Etsy for videogames.
- Software developers can create limited-edition videogames with inherent value based on rarity, similar to how [Wu Tang Clan created a single copy of its “Once In Shaolin” album](https://www.bloomberg.com/features/2015-martin-shkreli-wu-tang-clan-album/).
- GameStop creates a secondary digital market for “used” digital games and collectibles, exactly how it has done with physical game media and collectibles in its brick-and-mortar stores.
- Every transaction will be written publicly to the blockchain.  But each account will remain anonymously hidden as a hexadecimal hash code.  But **by linking the blockchain accounts to GameStop PowerUp Rewards accounts or PowerPass accounts, GameStop will have a monopoly on the true identities of its marketplace users**.  This will give GameStop a unique advantage in providing customer data to software developers around the world.

It might be better though if [GameStop’s Principal Engineer explains how this will work](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/magic-gathering-multiverse-metaverse-jordan-holberg/).

&nbsp;

***GameStop is about to completely change the videogame industry.***

#THE FINAL BOSS

One of the great challenges of cryptocurrency adoption is that it can take forever to make a transaction.  Once you agree with another person to give away your cryptocurrency in exchange for some material object or service, the network still has to validate that you have the currency available and that the exchange properly moved that currency to the correct recipient.  This can take several minutes or several hours, depending on the condition of the network at the time.

In contrast, you can flash your mobile phone at a near-field communication (NFC) receiver and buy your Starbucks coffee in seconds.  Even if you use your chip-and-pin card to make a purchase, the whole transaction takes less than a minute.  EVERY. SINGLE. TIME.

This is because companies like Visa have built a very large infrastructure to make sure that money moves quickly throughout the world.  The speed of the network is measured in “transactions per second” (TPS).  **Visa, with a 20,000 TPS network speed, is the Goliath against which cryptocurrency developers compare themselves**. (People argue about what the true TPS is for Visa, I’m ready for the comments…)

There is an equivalently monolithic goliath for digital videogame transactions.  

&nbsp;

**It’s Steam.**

&nbsp;

When GameStop was trying to deliver games digitally with its Impulse service at 10% of the U.S. market, Steam was crushing GameStop with 70% of the U.S. market.  Steam is the largest and most popular digital game distribution platform worldwide, with over 30,000 titles available for download.  Nearly half of all software developers sell their games on Steam.  

But developers don’t want to sell on Steam, or Apple’s App Store, or Google Play.  These companies take a 30% haircut on every single transaction in their markets.  This is why Epic Games took Apple to the U.S. Supreme Court.

***Building a cohesive and seamless videogame market that can compete with Steam is the true final boss that GameStop must face***.  But to achieve success while also giving *Power to the Players*, *Power to the Creators*, and *Power to the Collectors*, without gouging developers with a 30% cut on every transaction – that will be what truly makes GameStop into the clear market dominator.

---

#TA;DR

***Ryan Cohen has achieved for GameStop what he did for Chewy, but eight times faster.***

***Genba Digital is a British company that GameStop seems to be doing business with.***

***Combining Genba’s seamless digital videogame marketplace with non-fungible tokens (NFTs) on the blockchain and the Interplanetary File System (IPFS) for digital rights management will create a completely unique cloud-based videogame marketplace that will enable both developers and players to trade device-agnostic digital content while still supporting the original creators.***

***Maybe GameStop will purchase Azerion Holdings, Genba’s parent company and a major videogames and advertising company in Europe.***

&nbsp;

Thanks for playing along with me as I entertained this speculative fan-fiction.

&nbsp;

-PMNK",427.0,2021-08-20 16:44:46,0.96
"ETH isn't going to zero, but...","Here is the tl;dr paragraph:

*Polygon and Hermez announced a merger over the weekend, the first of its kind in the industry. It hit me like lightning, because the 13 members of Polygon were already a rockstar group amongst the industry's best, but adding Hermez's 24 members...well, they now form a DevOps team which is the most talented in the crypto-asset world, probably by far. So as an Ethereum bull, I decided to force myself to steel man my own beliefs about Ether, and write a post on why Ether has to change or risk oblivion. It didn't feel good or natural. My apologies. Read at your own risk.*


With Polygon's Hermez merger and a zkEVM inbound, what purpose does Layer 1 serve other than transaction finality and redundant security communication? Only a fool uses Layer 1 for anything other than staking ETH. It's too expensive, too slow, and all the newest and desirable stuff has built atop Polygon, because it just doesn't work on Layer 1, wether that's gaming or complex NFT's. All the legacy Dapps are migrating (or plan on migrating) to L2 as well. 

DeFi has a learning curve accompanied by far too much friction for the masses to use yet. That means anyone that knows how to use L1 DeFi now, doesn't need help climbing up to L2's Valhalla, in a matter of minutes. And that's what we've been seeing happen steadily since the spring. 

Will the ETH 2.0 merge help? No. Throughput will still be crap until sharding, and although fees will be lower, they'll still be too high compared to competition, and the elephant in the room that everyone's ignored will finally get recognized: GOVERNANCE. This last bit is going to be a political quagmire that sees future EIP's and innovation take serious time for implementation. Meanwhile L2 and unrelated projects will busy at light-speed, checking-off roadmap markers in record time. 

What Layer 1's native coin Ether needs, is to become the protocol's Bitcoin. It needs to become an excellent store of value, a gas token, and passive income generator simultaneously. Thankfully EIP-1559 took us a step in the right direction, but it's still not enough. If Ether focuses on this, it can ground the EVM in times of global economic inflation, volatility, and speculation. Then it can give on to L2 seamlessly in a global deflationary environment (these often coincide with credit crunches) which can set DeFi on fire, as speculation turns to low-risk high-return yield. 

Issuance of Ether must get cut to where it's far less than what's being burnt, ie true deflation. Currently we're burning about 27% of the daily issuance. The problem is this: L1 activity might decline significantly in the next year as other projects raise ecosystems and Polygon continues syphoning L1 users. This could mean that issuance is roughly equal to what's burnt. That's not good enough in this competitive environment. And speaking of EIP-1559, Polygon will implement their own version of it this fall. Their version will see the burnt base fee of MATIC get sent to the protocol's treasury, where it will be community governed and used for more acquisitions, for hacking bounties, development, distributions, partnerships, etcetera, making certain Polygon will never be completed, its imagination always financed. 

I authored a post a few weeks back talking about not buying ETH anymore

https://www.reddit.com/r/ethtrader/comments/oiikcd/i_wont_be_buying_eth_again_my_investment_thesis/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf 

and instead suggested buying, staking, and stacking tokens from the EVM's top projects:

 - MATIC
 - LINK
 - AAVE
 - SNX
 - UNI
 - etcetera...

Because these projects thrive on all levels, and with coming interoperability bridges, they'll spiderweb themselves into many different projects. DO NOT be surprised to see these same Dapps begin to form the backbone of DeFi not just in the EVM, but across the crypto-asset space. Then there's composability, I won't get into that here, but it's a tenet of Web 3.0

My point is that Polygon does what L1 only wishes it could. And unlike other bullshit blockchains without ecosystems yet, it already has the users, talent, trust, Dapps, partnerships, and ambitious roadmap. Now with ZK-rollups (the holy grail of crypto) going commercial maybe late next year, Ether has to change, or I see no reason for it to trade above $1000. Nobody I know uses L1 for anything anymore. And as I hinted at above, community governance is going to wreck havoc on L1 after the full 2.0 merge—an achilles heel nobody's bothered talking about. 

Polygon on the other hand I've placed an enormous price target of $40-$60 on in the next two years, which will put its market cap still below *Bank of America* or *Mastercard*. Is that unreasonable? Not with an exploding TVL, a holy grail, and exponential user growth making up the progressive half of the Byzantine Empire. 🤷‍♂️ Change my mind.


*Postscript:*

*25% of my crypto portfolio is still ETH, and that won't change.*",237.0,2021-08-18 04:00:17,0.9
Eth2 it's not what you think,"Sorry for the baity title, but I have seen many people talking about how 2.0 will fix the fees issue.

There's a huge misconception here expecting 2.0 to be the solution to scaling, I have good and bad news for you.

**Bad news:** Ethereum has adopted a rollup-centric roadmap. What this means? Eth2.0 won't lower the fees directly

https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/a-rollup-centric-ethereum-roadmap/4698

**Good news:** Rollups will do it, and they are releasing this month with hundreds of apps ready like Uniswap, that is, the scaling you were expecting with ""2.0 release"" comes in 2 weeks maximum



Also, future upgrades like sharding will allow cheaper rollup txs, but don't expect cheaper L1 fees

Lastly let me clear this, eth2 is the consensus layer, eth1 is the user layer, the merge will mix eth2 with eth1 into a big Ethereum, so Eth 2.0 is not what comes after Eth 1.0, that's the reason why the Ethereum Foundation has disambiguated the 2.0 term.

TLDR; Eth2.0 is a term used for devs to name the consensus layer, you're probably using it wrong. Scalability solution is released this month with Arbitrum One rollup release.",36.0,2021-08-17 12:46:53,0.79
Rollup-centric Ethereum: Why it will dominate,"Ethereum has pivoted to a rollup-centric vision. This means Ethereum's focus is no longer being a smart contract platform, but rather, a platform for smart contract platforms (rollups).

Users will use rollups. Rollups will settle on Ethereum. This is the new vision.

So, why rollups? Until now, we were in a monolithic blockchain paradigm where an L1 blockchain must do it all - execution, data availability and consensus. Unfortunately, building a new consensus mechanism from scratch is extremely difficult, to the extent that only Bitcoin and Ethereum have been able to do it successfully. The moment you build a highly secure consensus mechanism, though, you end up with very limited scalability - and upgradability is very difficult. Every other L1 has extremely centralized token distributions and has to resort to delegations, which in turn results in highly insecure and centralized consensus.

But what if a blockchain can focus on doing one thing, and only one thing best: very fast and cheap transactions; while leaving the impossibly challenging work of security, decentralization and network effects to a different chain that has already achieved all of that? That's a rollup. A rather silly but apt analogy is that rollups are the farmers that buy tractors and fertilizers from others who have figured that stuff out, while L1s are farmers that are stubborn about doing everything themselves and end up with misshaped sickles and using horseshit for fertilizers. The modern farmer will always be 100x more efficient than the 18th century one.

So, it's abundantly clear that rollups are far superior to monolithic blockchains. So why is Ethereum unique? Why does Ethereum have no competitors? I've already alluded to the answers above. Rollups will always choose to deploy to chains with the highest security, decentralization, network effects and data availability. That leaves us with two options - Bitcoin and Ethereum. Since Bitcoin does not support rollups, we've now narrowed down to only one option - Ethereum.

Now, some would say that perhaps a rollup doesn't care about security, and just wants to deploy on a L1 with the greatest data availability. Currently, there are indeed EVM-compatible chains that offer greater data availability, at the cost of security and decentralization, but long term, even this dynamic will flip on its head.

Ethereum is focusing on offering not just security, but also massive data availability in the future. There are 210,000 validators on the beacon chain already, well before the Merge. Long term, it's quite possible there will be 1,000,000 active validators.

The astute among you may have observed that the rollup-centric vision is somewhat similar to Polkadot. There are significant differences between rollups and execution shards, but I won't get into that now. What I'll point out is that Polkadot has a maximum cap of 1,000 validators, with 100 shards. Theoretically, Polkadot is best placed to pivot to a rollup-centric roadmap like Ethereum. However, this is where Ethereum's singularity enters.

With 1,000,000 active validators, Ethereum is uniquely positioned to offer massive data availability across 1,024 data shards long-term, a feat that a more centralized consensus mechanism can simply not achieve. With this, all rollups leveraging Ethereum, on aggregate, will scale to 100,000 TPS in a couple of years, increasing to several million over the years, and speculatively 15 million TPS by the end of the decade.

It is simply impossible to achieve this sort of scale any other way than the combination of rollups (specifically zkRollups) and data shards long-term, and only Ethereum can offer massive data availability in a massively decentralized fashion.

The final question is - why can't other L1s achieve Ethereum's massive decentralization? They can, but they'll need to go through 6 years of high-inflation distributive proof-of-work mining, intense activity for several years, and only then can they achieve a wide token distribution. Most L1s have committed to delegated-type proof-of-stake right from inception with highly centralized token distributions, and it's nearly impossible they'll achieve Ethereum's decentralization. Of course, decentralization is much more than just token distribution and consensus mechanisms - it's infrastructure, multi-client development approaches, etc.

I regret this greatly, though, and I do wish there would be some competition, any competition. Realistically, Bitcoin could make it happen, but I highly doubt they will. The other possibility is a conglomerate powered by big tech that does a massive airdrop on billions of people. Or, it could be some revolutionary new technology that'll displace rollups, just like rollups have displaced monolithic blockchains. Of these, I consider the last the most realistic possibility.

In the here and now, though, I only see one eventuality. 90+% of all transactions in the blockchain industry will happen on zkRollups, and a majority of those will be settled on Ethereum. Do note that I expect this to take several years to materialize.

Ethereum will use an estimated 99.95% less energy post merge,"TLDR: Under PoW, as the price of ETH and the hash rate are positively correlated. Therefore, as the price increases, in equilibrium so too does the power consumed by the network. Under Proof-of-Stake, when the price of ETH increases, the security of the network does too (the value of the ETH at-stake is worth more), but the energy requirements remain unchanged.

ETH is the Trade of the Century,"I will be sharing some of the milestones to look forward to that I believe will have positive price impacts. Please discuss, explore, and add/remove as you see fit. Appreciate the collaboration in advance. Some of them are entirely theoretical so take the hopium with a grain of salt. #NFA 

• **ETH 2.0 Merge fixed date announcement.** 

Vitalik has said that there is an optimistic case for the merge to occur in 2021, but realistically to expect it early 2022. I am prepared to wait for the latter. [This!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifTrUw7Ayks&t=3s&ab_channel=LexClips) was a great video that explains how brilliantly seamless the merge will be at the expense of not having PoW history. 

I think that this single milestone will be the most bullish one of them all. I expect people to fomo into ETH so that they can have validator nodes. Nobody really knows how profitable they will be or what the potential earnings are, but the bullish narrative that ETH will scale to meet global demands for finance (now ""DeFI"") will surely drive the mania. 

• ""The Triple Halving"" https://ultrasound.money/  

I expect strong narratives to form around Ethereum's monetary policies and, to the absolute dismay of BTC maxis, ETH might be compared to Bitcoin and touted as being ""a better/the next Bitcoin"". 

• **Rollups / Scalability Upgrade**

Likely to occur in 2022 or possibly 2023, the major ""scalability"" upgrade will make Ethereum feel like Polygon, but faster and more secure/decentralized. I am not sure if PoS (ETH 2.0) will inherently make micro-transactions possible because even if the gas prices are significantly lower such as $0.10 on a very busy day, it still creates roadblocks for certain apps. However, once there is no reason to migrate to another L2 for efficiency, I think Ethereum is going to take back a significant amount of marketshare from chains such as BNB, ADA, DOT, etc, etc. Just my opinion but a lot of developers would prefer to build on Ethereum, and they reluctantly use ghost chains to ship things. 

• $10,000k ETH ""psychological barrier"" Just my opinion, but beyond 10k I think that perceptions will change and people will see ETH as being a very strong store of value. 

• A fortune 50/FAANG company utilizes Ethereum in production 

If the market is starting to price Ethereum based on its adoption and usage metrics, the very first company that integrates into Ethereum (in one way or another) may be a signal of the future ahead. NFTs are obviously the hot topic at the moment and may play a big role. 


Needless to say, I think 3k/eth might be a bargain compared to prices 1-3 years from today.",20.0,2021-08-15 15:55:25,0.91
This is exciting! Ethereum 2.0 earlier than expected?,"Now the ethereum website show following:

***Latest: Eth2 researchers are working on ways to accelerate the merge. It will probably happen earlier than expected. More soon.***

*Link:* [https://ethereum.org/en/eth2/](https://ethereum.org/en/eth2/)

Any speculations?

PS: Get Eth stacked and don't cry later;) Hope we have time until EOY.",58.0,2021-08-15 10:11:24,0.81
People who believe that Eth 2.0 will solve the high fees need to watch this talk by Vitalik Buterin,"Some people thought EIP-1559 would lower the fees. Some people think the merge to proof of stake will lower the fees. Many people in this sub think that sharding will lower the fees on layer 1.

The truth is that **Ethereum's scalability solution is rollups** and sharding will only provide more data for rollups so it will make rollups faster but not layer 1 Ethereum.

Vitalik Buterin talked about this last year. He explained the scalability roadmap in detail and as far as I know this plan hasn't really changed since then (please correct me if I'm wrong).

Here's the link to Vitalik's talk: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r0jtV9mxdI0",167.0,2021-08-15 08:20:09,0.94
The merger of Hermēz and Polygon. Did the EVM just acquire Daenerys Targaryen's Dragons?,"The TL;DR is this: You're grossly underestimating the combined power and innovation of Ethereum's L1 and L2. 


If you have a computer programming background, you'll know ZK-rollups were still science fiction five years ago. Well, Hermēz and Polygon (two organizations with absolute rockstar development teams) have been working on them for years. What ZK-rollups can do is exponentially increase throughput (TPS), dramatically reduce fees, and make security the envy of all blockchains. Yesterday Hermēz and Polygon dropped a bombshell: both protocols and teams are merging together, making an integrated devOps team, which I now personally consider the most talented group in the entire crypto-asset industry. Sure there's Gavin Wood of Polkadot, and Hayden Adams of Uniswap, etcetera, these are geniuses, but as a team, Polygon (13 members) and Hermēz (24 members) is disturbingly talented. 

MA (mergers and acquisitions) isn't something we've seen in the decentralized crypto space. This is a first of its kind and tells me the space is growing up and wising to the fact that competition is becoming cannibalistic. The biggest threat to ETH killers is no longer Ethereum, it's other ETH killers. Competition is extreme. In previous crypto cycles there may've been 1 (maybe 2). Now there are at least 7 ETH killers currently ☠️:

 - ADA
 - ICP
 - DOT
 - ALGO
 - SOL
 - BSC
 - XRP

But here's a damning statistic hodlers of these [shit]coins should shudder to:

Of the top **10** crypto tokens by market capitalization, **3** of them are ERC tokens:

 - ETH
 - USDC
 - UNI

You see, ERC tokens dominate the midrange, and have been slowly moving up the rankings for years. I mean hell, 1.1% of the entire Bitcoin supply is wrapped (WBTC) in the EVM. It's a top 20 token!!!!! That's predatory AF. If ETH flips BTC, USDC will likely flip USDT a year later, and that will jack ERC tokens up the rankings (again, where they already dominate the midrange) until about 6 make up the top 10 respectively:

 - ETH
 - USDC
 - UNI
 - LINK (currently #13)
 - MATIC (currently #16)
 - WBTC (currently #17)

By then hopefully people will realize the linear inevitability of what's been happening for years. 

So MA will be critical to survival of these unrelated blockchains—and this is AFTER they've already bridged (or velvet forked) into the EVM.

The merger of Polygon and Hermēs is going to render most ETH challengers effete. If there was ever going to be an ETH killer, it was always going to come from the inside. But L1 and L2 work synergistically, like the Byzantine Empire (when Rome was divided into east and west with two emperors). They borrow from one another, leverage one another, compete with one another, and quite frankly, most users won't realize which level they're on in a few year's time. 

I view Polygon as the most ambitious and important project in the EVM, followed by UNI, AAVE, and oddly, OpenSea, which has been responsible for burning 13% of all ETH base fees since EIP-1559. Which brings me to Polygon's version of EIP-1559: They'll burn a MATIC base fee which is transferred to the treasury, where it'll be community governed, and used for more acquisitions, distributions, and hacking bounties, in addition to taking a bunch off the market in general.

With Ethereum's staking rewards and newfound deflationary trick (remember the 2.0 merge will reduce issuance to .5% compared to today's 2%, which before EIP-1559 was 4%) the protocol is uniquely suited to times of higher volatility, speculation, and global inflation. Many in the crypto-asset industry as well as the world, believe hyperinflation is coming. It's a narrative we can all seemingly repeat verbatim. But hyperinflation is not coming. Not to the US at least. Deflation is. I see global cyclical indicators weakening in the next couple years, and slowing global liquidity reinforcing a *deflationary shock* which tightens financial conditions and lowers the SP 500 P/E ratio several multiples. I also see politics eroding further (I don't believe in political parties, I believe in ideas and decentralization) as the mid-term elections approach late next year.

I know this is all way out of consensus, but I don't mind occupying that space. And with this economic slowdown comes a credit-crunch where borrowing becomes difficult for commercial and retail individuals. Where will folks turn? DeFi. The world will turn to DeFi. You and I capturing what were traditionally bank margins (profits). Interestingly, this makes the EVM uniquely suited to capture the opposite of a speculative inflationary environment too, by proffering zero-risk yield opportunities. 

You'll see quite a few defaults from real estate to businesses. But unlike the *Great Recession* (2008-2015), and other instances of a credit crunch, interest rates are already at **zero.** This creates a disastrous situation. There's nothing left for the Federal Reserve to do. Negative interest rates? What sense would it make for a person to keep money in a bank, where they'd be charged to keep it? This is partly why bank fees came about during the *Great Recession* and have stuck with us since, because interest rates have remained near zero. Imagine those fees tripling. It's also why we're seeing reverse repos at astronomical levels. I'm not going to get too deep into this stuff, but will add that because central banks provide a benchmark for all borrowing costs across an economy, negative rates can spread to a range of fixed-income securities, with government bonds of countries usually trading at negative yields. That means investors LOSE money if they hold the debt to maturity. This happened with Germany by the way, after the ECB went negative with interest rates in June 2014, charging banks .05% to hold cash. And because Germany is a country with a strong culture of saving money, it was disastrous. So if you ever wonder why Germany's government is so friendly to crypto for an EU member, that's your answer. And somewhat related, a friend of mine recently asked why I was so stupid to buy CoinBase shares at $225. ""Easy,"" I said, ""Because on stablecoins (which are essentially like a savings account), I can make 8% APY, and there's a debit card, with rewards. No bank offers that. Even my goldbug-dollar-saving grandfather threw in the towel and opened a CoinBase account after learning the yield. I now know several people opposed to crypto who own crypto (if that makes any sense) simply in the space to make yield on their dollars while waiting for stock market opportunities as they expect a pullback. But when you're that close to it, buying decentralized crypto like BTC or ETH becomes much easier for these folks...

Anyway, the Polygon/Hermēz merger is like giving the EVM Daenerys Targaryen's dragons 🐉🐉🐉. And I'll make a bold prediction: If Chainlink (see all this shit is related) accomplishes what they talked about at SmartCon last week with the bridges and partnerships (especially their validator list), and brings off-chain data on-chain commercially, the EVM will stomp every crypto protocol to plant food with only BTC and possibly privacy coins surviving. Because composability will explode, and with L2, there will no longer be a single advantage anywhere outside the zkEVM. I've written a previous post on how CBDC's will cause DeFi to savage the traditional financial system and make you rich, so won't bother with that here. 

I see MATIC moving up 15x within 12 months and into the top 10, while ETH flips BTC after ETH breaks $15k next summer. I truly don't believe most of you have any clue how high these top crypto projects are going to moon. But when you learn your way around DeFi, understand yield, liquidity aggregation, composability, how predatory they are to any digital business, how predatory they are to anything that can be digitized, and how they'll all optimize human interaction with finance and media, you'll see how grossly outdated our current system is. Divide everything in the world into 21M BTC or a deflationary ETH. Then realize new products, innovation, and money can be added to the world economy.🤑",65.0,2021-08-14 09:20:29,0.95
The year is 2048,"It's my first day at my new school, I have to load up my ERC20 tokens from my old school from cold storage onto Metamask, in order to swap them at fair market value for the token my new school uses. Then I trustlessly bridge them onto the school's custom-made Layer 2 chain.

I go out and wait for the bus. They all have a QR code I gotta scan to look up the NFT for their route. As soon as mine is about to come up I have to flash my own QR code to get it to stop for me. I get on and scan my NFT bus pass and get immediately deducted some tokens. It's more expensive today since yesterday's bus was over half full. This reminds me I have to ask my mom to take some AmazonCoins from her salary at Amazon and trustlessly bridge them from the Amazon Smart Chain into WrappedAmazonCoins on Ethereum so I can swap them for more BusFareToken.

I arrive at my new school, gotta zero-knowledge prove I have no weapons on me to enter. That's pretty cool, I was always annoyed at my old school's metal detectors for not fully respecting my privacy.

I go get my class schedule minted as an NFT, but I don't really feel like having math early on Mondays I anonymously swap it on-chain with another student. I get to my English class a bit late, the teacher is in the middle of showing us how to come up with clever poems to better remember our private seed.

I already know all this stuff so I fuck around on my phone playing the latest DeFi game. The teacher spots me and scans my QR code, I immediately get deducted SchoolTokens — 5% of which are burned, 2.5% is returned to the liquidity pool, and 2.5% is sent to the teacher as bonus on his salary. 

At lunch time, I try to pay for food with the SchoolTokens I have left but the cafeteria is run by a different company and they make me swap my SchoolTokens for their own. I immediately get rugpulled, god damn it. I don't even have SchoolTokens left to swap for other students' leftovers.

I skip the afternoon and head home, of course I gotta listen to my dad telling me how the world was better before worldwide crypto adoption for the 1000th time. I realize this means we're still early, so I buy more ETH in anticipation for the merge that's coming in just a few months.",33.0,2021-08-13 07:23:14,0.72
The shifting tides of ether economics,"Earlier this year, gas fees were sustaining over 120 gwei and everyone was excited about massive deflation coming to ether post-Merge, myself included. Numbers like [25% staking APRs](https://twitter.com/drakefjustin/status/1384124998084792324) were common, with some estimates as high as 70%! However, I started questioning these assumptions, and [wrote a post about it](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/n10l7h/what_if_total_daily_transaction_fees_in_eth_have/). That started my journey down the rabbit hole of discovering things not being as extreme as it seems, and how one needs to be very careful extrapolating today’s Ethereum onto the future. 

Let’s see how things will change by 2023: 

* Rollups + data shards will be live, offering 85,000 TPS. Compare this to today’s 55 TPS. This is an insane positive supply shock unlike anything in Ethereum’s history. The previous models of a gradual 400% increase in gas limits over 6 years is nothing quite like a 150,000% increase in 2 years. Yes, some activity has moved to sidechains and rollups, but you get the point — it’s three orders of magnitude. We’re entering a new paradigm here, and we have to be wary of using past models. 
* The question here is, [as I alluded to in my previous post](https://polynya.medium.com/some-notes-on-ether-economics-1177f58571ee?source=your_stories_page-------------------------------------), is there enough demand to saturated this exponential positive supply shock and maintain parity on burn rates? My hope is that demand will be induced, we’ll see a whole new wave of applications on rollups that were never possible on L1, and the new supply will be saturated. But this is very speculative, and we have to be aware that it may not happen as quickly as we may expect. 
* The current target for 0% inflation post-Merge is \~15 gwei basefee, with \~26 gwei basefee for \~33M ETH staked. We’ve seen gas fees as low as 5 gwei just a month ago, and with rising scale there are no guarantees that high enough gas fees will sustain on L1. 
* Furthermore, with a rising ETH price, the demand for gas in ETH terms tends to fall even if it maintains parity in fiat terms. So, if we head up to, say, $10,000, suddenly the \~30 gwei median we’ve seeing over the last couple of months is equivalent like \~10 gwei. 
* In 2023, we’re in a rollup + data sharded + proof-of-stake world. Uncle risk is zero, and MEV is also near zero for data shards with the shard builder / block proposer separation. Execution chain MEV will hopefully also be lower with a similar block builder / proposer separation, but it’ll definitely be non-zero. I expect priority fees to be very low, and certainly much lower than today in a pre-1559-style-transactions + proof-of-work + anarchic MEV world. I speculate long-term staking APRs to settle in the 2%-3% range with \~30M ETH staked. 

In the long term, I believe we’ll find an economic equilibrium for ether, with inflation at 0.1%-0.2%, L1-equivalent basefee settling in the 15–26 gwei range (note: most of the fees will actually be collected from the data shards, just offering an equivalent here for information purposes), and a stable demand for transactions. If demand for transactions rises significantly, and we head into deflationary territory, this will naturally be corrected with a higher ETH price. Conversely, if demand falls, we’ll see higher inflation, and thus, price corrected to the downside. So why a mildly positive inflation instead of 0% like I had previously thought? I’m leaning on there always being some monetary premium. 

This is all just speculation, though. It’s a long road to get there, and we should not take it from granted. 

Here’s my bearish case for Ethereum short-term. It actually begins with a heavily bullish scenario, where price skyrockets on hopium of high deflation, high staking APRs, and a lot of FOMO. As the price rises, basefee falls (even if overall demand is constant in fiat terms), we head back into inflation, and panic ensues. People leave the markets, speculative activity declines, which in turn further reduces burn rates and increases inflation. Rollups mature, data shards roll out, and burn rates plummet further. You can see how this can easily spiral into a sustained bear market. Eventually, we will find an equilibrium as mentioned above, but it could be a very volatile road to get there. And yes, of course, said equilibrium may or may not be at higher prices than we’re at now. 

My hope is that this scenario is avoided, and one way this can happen is if we see more of a gradual rise in ether price over time. I believe that the transition to rollups is a gradual journey over the next couple of years, so a smoother adoption curve will certainly help mitigate basefee volatility. I could be wrong though, and half of Ethereum ends up on Arbitrum One by this time next month! 

The other consideration would be to roll out data shards gradually. For example, instead of 64 shards at 248 kB, why not start with 16 shards at 124 kB? This may even be lower risk to implement too, potentially expediting the first release. (I had asked Vitalik a similar question in the last AMA, he said [it’s possible.](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/o4unlp/ama_we_are_the_efs_research_team_pt_6_23_june_2021/h2rhceg/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)) A gentler supply increase will reduce the impact of a positive supply shock for the shard fee markets. 

My intent with this article is to simply ask questions, and keep the discussions going. Let’s be careful about making confident presumptions from Ethereum’s limited history, especially as we head into a bold new future. Let’s be a little humbler about the ultra sound money and deflationary memes — we have yet to earn it. ",220.0,2021-08-12 20:52:04,0.99
"Getting the best results from Flexpool support (or any support), EIP-1559, and a tip about the next pool","I've helped over 2000 of you out on the website/email support in the last couple of months, and more on our social channels. Based on those experiences, I would like to offer some suggestions to help you get the most out of your support experience, whether on [flexpool.io](https://flexpool.io), our support@ email alias, Discord, Telegram, or right here on Reddit.

Some of these tips will apply to other support sources, like other software, other pools, your phone company, the police department, customer service at stores and companies, etc.

1. If you have very specific account/miner/farmer questions (i.e. about your specific payouts, account settings, etc... it's best to use the website chat/help button or [support@flexpool.io](mailto:support@flexpool.io) . General questions that don't involve your private info are usually fine in public (i.e. ""how frequent are hourly payouts,"" ""What are the best settings for teamredminer with my 3060 v2 LHR card,"" ""When will your Whoppercoin pool open"" etc) can be public, but I will usually suggest anything that involves your payout address(es) or IP addresses go to the official support channels.
2. If you come to any of our forums, it's fine to be friendly, but please **put your question out as soon as possible so we can start answering**. If you send a message at 3am California time that just says ""hi"" then I get in around 8am and have nothing to work with. And at least 6 out of 10 ""hi"" or ""ola"" messages never respond again, which makes it hard to help you with your problems.
3. If you are making account-specific requests (i.e. ""please change my payout limit or gas price"") it never hurts to **share your payout address in the request/chat**... the one you want settings changed on. If you go to your bank and say ""please give me $10 from my account"" they probably won't do it unless you identify the account. **Don't do this on Discord or Reddit or Telegram** unless support or admins/""Team Flexpool"" ask you to, as they will want to delete it once they have copied it to check your dashboard.
4. If you have general questions about payouts, transactions, pool configuration, etc, it is helpful to **mention if you're asking about Chia or Ethereum**. Some answers are the same (hourly payouts, minimum payout of 0.01) but many details are different.
5. **Pool support is usually limited to Flexpool-specific support issues.** This means we may be able to give general suggestions on miner configurations for our pool, or what miner to use, but we can't support every hardware, software, OS, and network option, and we don't control or support third party wallets, exchanges, brokerages, ISPs, or hot dog stands. Our Discord, Telegram, and Reddit give you a chance to exchange questions, suggestions, best practices, shopping tips, recipes for gaspacho, and other things that the pool doesn't officially support.

And a few quick things to check before checking in with support.

1. If you're wondering where your payout is, **check your payout limit against your unpaid balance**. I've probably had a request a day for the last 2-3 weeks where someone had a payout limit of 0.2 and an unpaid balance of 0.02xxx and wondered why it wasn't paid out.
2. **You can check the Telegram chat for recent payouts**. Every hour, when the hourly payout cycle finishes, Flexbot says something like ""🤑 New Payout round was processed at 31 Gwei ($1.89)."" You can compare this against your gas limit to see how close you were. I still recommend a limit of 50 and some patience, but if your gas price limit was 20--no matter what you saw on etherscan gas tracker at any given second in the last week--a payout processed at 31 Gwei would not happen for you.
3. **Check the pinned messages** on Telegram and in the #pool-support channel on Discord, as well as ""new"" posts from me or u/flexpool here on Reddit. We try to avert floods of questions, and with your help we can avoid 50 duplicate questions when something pretty simple happens.
4. Check your miner configuration and **make sure you're actually mining to Flexpool**. I've seen this in Flexpool and on Hiveon chats, where someone sees nothing on their dashboard, and it turns out they're mining to a completely different pool.
5. Along those lines, **make sure you're mining to your actual wallet address**. Flexpool does not issue wallet addresses (the one in the get started page is grayed out and doesn't go anywhere), and most miners come with default addresses in their examples. So make sure you are using your wallet, and that it's in the configuration you're using. Otherwise you're probably donating 100% to your miner developer.

And finally, because this has bitten a few of you in the last month... make sure you understand your wallet provider/exchange/wherever you mine to. It's best to have a **paper wallet or hardware wallet,** or at least a wallet where you have the **private keys and mnemonics**, so you control the wallet yourself.

If you can't do that, **be aware of your exchange or wallet provider's policies**. Some people have found a South American exchange who will keep any deposits under 0.01 ETH for example. You can get around this by setting a higher minimum payout, or you can consider other exchanges or options. And several of you had your exchange shut down on very short notice a couple of months ago. **Think about what you'll do if your exchange shuts down**, or stops serving your state/province/country, as some exchanges have started doing due to the regulatory environment.

And finally, especially in light of the last week's developments in Ethereum, please understand that **we cannot do anything about EIP-1559 and the decrease in revenues**. This is affecting everyone, on every pool as well as solo mining, and we get to live with it. Search your favorite search engine for EIP-1559 and see what it means to miners. You can investigate other coins to mine, but ETH will probably still be the overall best option for quite a while yet, even with the 10-20% average reduction in ETH earnings. Ultimately, do what's right for you, your specific equipment, and your risk/reward profile.

Just one more thing. **Flexpool is considering what's next, after the Chia pool is ""completed.""** We have no announcements, public plans, time frames, or promises around this. I can say we will almost certainly have another option well ahead of the ETH 2.0 merge (and no, nobody knows exactly when that will happen), and we will put out the best pool product we can for whatever coin it is. But don't hold your breath for the announcement, or you'll pass out several times. It'll come when the team is ready to announce something, and you'll have to try pretty hard to miss it when it is announced.",22.0,2021-08-09 17:21:04,0.97

"ETH has managed to burn 4,600 ETH 24 hours after the EIP went live. Here are some simple calculations you can make to see if / when ETH will become deflationary + implications of POS' triple halving.","[https://ultrasound.money/](https://ultrasound.money/)

*If this burn rate* continues for 365 days we will end up burning

**1.715 million ETH.**

In contrast, the current issuance rate of ETH is 4%. That is

**4.7 million ETH ->** This is the amount of ETH that would have been pumped into the economy were it not for 1559. After 1559, we can expect the inflation to go down to **3 million ETH.**

\-----------

Now of course this trend will not continue for a year. Because POS is expected to Merge with the POW net in 6 months, approximately.

Firstly, what is going to happen to ETH issuance rate under POS?

There is a simple calculation for that:

[https://docs.ethhub.io/ethereum-basics/monetary-policy/](https://docs.ethhub.io/ethereum-basics/monetary-policy/)

In simple terms, if there is 10 million ETH staked, the rewards rate for stakers shall be 5.72%, this gives us an issuance rate of **0.54%.**

0.54%! Compare that to the current issuance of 4%. This is what people mean by 'triple halving'. An immediate shock shall be hit the moment the Merge happens. ETH issuance goes down from 4% to 0.5% IMMEDIATELY. What took BTC 12 years to achieve, ETH is gonna do it in 1 block length.

This is a triple halving because 4/2 = 2 -> 2/2 = 1 and 1/2 = 0.5. Three times divided by 2.

Now of course if there is 30 million ETH staked, then issuance rate would be **0.94%** with a reward rate of 3.3%.

From a game theory perspective, I do not expect that there would be 30 million ETH in stake, because people would want to seek better yields elsewhere instead. So the free market will keep the ETH rewards rate above 5% or so, hence the 0.5% issuance target.

\-----------

So what's gonna be the maximum supply of ETH by the time POS hits?

Assuming POS is gonna go live in 6 months and assuming a simular burn rate from now till then, we have:

2.35 million ETH issuance - 850,000 ETH burned by 1559 = 1.5 million ETH.

The current ETH supply is 116.9 million. That gives us 118.5 million ETH by the time POS hits.

Assuming issuance is 0.5 % (before burned by 1559), that gives us an inflation rate of 600,000 ETH per year.

Under POS, ETH only requires 15 gwei to be deflationary (as opposed to 150 gwei now). Even on days with gas price at like 5 to 10 gwei, 1559 is still expected to burn about 300,000 ETH per year. Thus, you can see 1559 as yet ANOTHER halving on ETH's issuance (cutting 600,000 ETH down to 300,000). This is a much more likely and easier to achieve scenario than to make ETH perpetually deflationary. But keep in mind that it's not even a far fetched goal to push ETH to become deflationary! ETH gas just need to be higher than 15 gwei to achieve that, but with layer 2 solutions rolling out, I am not sure if ETH will become immediately deflationary right after the Merge, but in the long run, I will say yes.

\-------------

Conclusion: Vitalik once said that he expects ETH total supply to remain under 120 million. And this little thesis is trying to prove that.",46.0,2021-08-06 12:19:06,0.77
Repost of what will happen at Block #12965000,"London: Here's what'll happen at Block #12965000

I'm not going into details about the EIPs, but just wanted to summarize what will happen in 8 hours' time. I had no plans to write this post, as London has been covered very well, but browsing through the Daily I see there are still some unanswered questions.

Firstly, a common misconception is that miners run the network. They do not - they just provide a service. It's the users running full nodes - exchanges, wallets, infra providers, end users transacting, developers etc. that are in charge. Given there's a near universal consensus among these users, there's zero need to worry about miners. Even if there was a majority (>51%) of miners declining London and choosing to fork, it doesn't matter - they'll be stuck on a fork that Ethereum users will simply ignore.

At block #12965000, the difficulty bomb will be delayed till December 2021. Some may have noticed anmild uptick in block times lately - this will reset back to targeting low 13s seconds. Given the same target gas limits, we should see a minor (\~5%) bump in TPS. Gas tokens like CHI will be deemed worthless. Contracts starting with the 0xEF byte will be rejected.

As for EIP-1559, once again, I'm assuming you understand the base fee and priority fee model.

At block #12965000, base fee will reset to 1 gwei. The block gas limits will temporarily double for the next few minutes, till base fee finds an equilibrium. Given recent gas prices, it'd be somewhere in the 20-50 gwei region. By my estimation, it'll take somewhere between 30 and 35 blocks, or 6 to 8 minutes. During this time, the network will be running at its highest throughput ever - 110 TPS for ETH transfers; 30 TPS for more complex transactions. (PS: Just to clarify, the target throughput will fall back to what it is now, so there are no sustained scalability improvements brought about by 1559. It'll just help smooth out the spikes.) This does not mean you can lowball 1 or 2 gwei and hope to get included - it'll just mean that the priority fees for the first few minutes will be very high.

At launch, [MyCrypto.com](https://MyCrypto.com) will support 1559-style transaction. MetaMask has made [incredible progress](https://github.com/MetaMask/metamask-extension/pulls?q=is%3Apr+label%3AEIP-1559+is%3Aclosed) in the last couple of days, but it's unlikely they'll have a new release supporting 1559 in the next 8 hours. You can still make transactions as usual on wallets that do not support 1559 transactions - they'll just be legacy transactions. The downside with legacy transactions is that if you overbid, you'll still be overpaying. However, you can mitigate this by following what the base fee is, offering a minimal overhead on top to account for priority fees (usually 1-2 gwei should suffice, but we'll need to wait and see what the typical priority fee is like) and manually entering this as your bid. For example, if base fee is 30 gwei and the typical priority fee is 3 gwei, you can just manually enter 33 gwei and there's a very good chance you'll get included. Of course, we should see all wallets support 1559-style transactions over the coming days and weeks - once that happens the wallet will do all of this for you, and you just need to accept their given estimate (advanced users can edit in their custom priority fee and max fee). In most cases, your transactions will confirm within an average of \~7 seconds. Irrespective of transactions being 1559 or legacy, base fees will always be burned.

Etherscan will support 1559, and there are other sites that'll let you follow the burn. Miners will need to double their block gas limit variable, which we'll assume they will, so users will not be affected.

The target gas price for deflationary ETH is approximately 190 gwei. Given current average gas price has been hovering around 30 gwei, deflation is very unlikely any time soon, though there'll be a not insignificant reduction in net inflation. Post-Merge the target is \~20 gwei, so that's when we might see deflation kick in. By the way, the assumption around these estimates is that the base fee : priority fee ratio will be 75:25, but with 1559 on mainnet we'll finally get more representative figures. I'll make an updated post around gas price targets once we have a better data.

Feel free to ask if you have any further doubts, I'll answer them to the best of my knowledge.",26.0,2021-08-05 06:13:57,0.94

(Addenda 1: MetaMask does intend to [support 1559 on August 5th](https://metamask.io/1559.html), though an exact time for the rollout is not given. 2: If you use a hardware wallet, it also needs to support it. So, if you use Ledger with Metamask, for example, both Ledger and MetaMask need to support it. 3: Ledger support is now live, with less than an hour to go!)

Update, roughly 4 hours after the fork: Everything went well, though my assumptions about miners doubling their block gas limit was somewhat optimistic. The current target is 14M instead of 15M pre-fork, so some straggling miners still need to update this. Ledger and MyCrypto support for 1559-style transactions is live, but still waiting on MetaMask.",155.0,2021-08-05 05:08:34,0.98
The Byzantine EVMpire,"
*EVM: Ethereum Virtual Machine*


I've used every major blockchain from Algorand to Z-cash. My *TL;DR* findings can be summarized like this: 

Any project without a robust ecosystem right this moment, has no future, with the exception of Bitcoin and Monero. 

Bitcoin is a pure store of value, a digital gold, and there's no need for it to be faster than it is. Imagine email 10x faster. It would make no difference. It's already plenty fast. BTC transactions don't have to be cheaper either, because quite frankly they make the network hyper secure, make HFT (high frequency trading) almost impossible, and these coins are generally for cold storage anyway, unless you actively participate in the EVM with them—which 1.1% of the entire BTC supply is currently wrapped on btw. It's a one-trick-pony coin and any protocol that tries usurping BTC with one trick won't be around by the next halving. 

Monero is the other exception. It has a trick: privacy. It's the defacto currency of the dark web and does one helluva job. Its cypherpunks are possibly the best in the world and its previous maintainer—FluffyPony—getting arrested recently only helps its rogue image. It also has a connection to BTC because of their nuclear swap wizardry, and when nuclear swaps go commercial, well, holy shit. I should imagine that this and DeFi will put pressure on some of the world's tax havens (Cayman Islands, Switzerland, Singapore, etcetera), which is probably why these countries have been so fast to pass incentivizing crypto legislation. Take a look at the number of Ethereum nodes for example popping up on the map in Singapore and these other tax-friendly locales.  

So that leaves us with projects boasting robust ecosystems then, aka smart contracts, aka dapps. There are no such projects outside the EVM save BSC, which is a centralized disaster. You see, Binance is currently busy getting globally regulated into oblivion. CZ wants to step-down as CEO and I'm baffled why anyone would trust BSC. I've had several problems using the service and when Binance on-chained a 3rd-party blockchain forensics company to ostensibly help with the perpetual rug-pulls and security exploits, that was my last straw. BSC is a centralized blockchain controlled and named after a centralized exchange that doesn't have a future unless it's divided up into separate independent companies (Binance.US, Binance.UK, etcetera), and that doesn't bode well for BSC. 

Then there's the me-too projects arriving years late to the party like Cardano and Algorand. What people fail to realize is that the EVM already won this war. Think of the top 10 crypto tokens by market capitalization for a second. There are now 3 (yes 3) ERC tokens in the top 10. Expect that to be 5 after the *Flippening*, because USDC will flip Tether the year after and jack ERC tokens up the rankings where they already dominate the midrange. Maybe when ERC tokens make up 8 of the top 10 all non-believers and pied-piped shills will realize the linear inevitability of what's been happening for years. 

So Polygon is the best real-world working blockchain I've personally used. It's superior to the EVM's L1 in all ways contending. I'm talking about the TPS, the transaction costs, the staking APY, the interoperability... Of course it's true that when all the 2.0 upgrades fully merge, L1 will be a hyper-secure, fast, and deflationary masterpiece. It'll also introduce full commercial staking with the miner kill-switch. That however, will come with a problem—governance. The mechanics of governance will be fine, and the validators beautifully distributed, but it'll lead to considerably slower future EIP integrations. This is where Polygon comes in. First a brief word on why its native token MATIC is grossly undervalued:

Polygon has given the EVM an insurmountable advantage amongst competing blockchains. Its ambition, partnerships, working product, and TVL (which is billions more than its market cap), are all enough for me to value MATIC at $50B, or about $8/token as it stands today. The current market cap is $6B. Consider the one-trick celebrity shitcoin Doge is 10x this, but Polygon won't remain so undervalued for long because there's likely to be a Byzantine-style government that arrises. Let me explain:

The Byzantine Empire was the Roman empire that had grown so large it was divided into East and West during late antiquity. Each had its own emporer. But unlike say East Germany and West Germany during the Cold War, neither side was antagonistic. They worked together. But the emperor in the western half (which included the city of Rome) had the veto power if there were ever disagreements between the two. It worked beautifully until a couple hundred years later the Visigoths sacked Rome. We could see a Byzantine government with L1 and L2 in the EVM. One emperor for the Western part of the Roman empire (Ethereum), and one emperor for the Eastern part of the Roman empire (Polygon). They'll both work together to form the EVMpire, although ETH will have ultimate veto power. And like the Eastern part, Polygon is the newest and most progressive. It can innovate quite fast, absorb and copy the best solutions of other blockchains quickly, add value and synergy. ZKrollups will start with them, and let's be honest, ZKrollups were science fiction 5 years ago. Polygon is a project run by a virtuoso development team from India, a country consistently producing some of the best Java/Solidity coders in the world, and Polygon was developed in part to allow that country participation in the EVM, which until then had transaction fees high enough to shut too many of them out. Speaking of India, let's wrap things up:

Vitalik Buterin pulled the greatest crypto move of 2021. He was gifted 410 trillion SHIB tokens. They appreciated to $12B. He burned half of the tokens by sending them to a black hole wallet, thereby reducing the supply dramatically which was good longterm for SHIB hodlers. Then he gifted the other half to Polygon founder Sandeep Nailwal's charity. His charity was set up for India's Covid relief as they were running out of oxygen and the sky was blackened with smoke from burning dead bodies. This was also only weeks after India passed unfavorable crypto legislation...that crypto legislation has since been rolled back. It was the most brilliant political maneuver I've seen, and no other blockchain can claim the last living crypto rockstar (assuming Satoshi is dead) as their own. In a celebrity obsessed world, that has to count for something.",44.0,2021-08-04 10:23:40,0.9
Comparing Lido and RocketPool,"This question came up on the RP Discord, and I figured I'd share it with the larger community here. Please sanity check, and if you know of a Lido article about post-merge plans, please share!

&#x200B;

* Lido: Live now.
* Rocketpool: Live ... September? Fingers crossed.
* Lido: Centralized now, aims to be decentralized.
* Rocketpool: Decentralized ""as feasible"", but see below for oDAO and concerns around that.
* Lido: stETH token, 1:1 to ETH staked. Alternatively wrapped wstETH token [through Bancor](https://blog.lido.fi/adding-wsteth-liquidity-using-bancor/).
* RocketPool: rETH token, 1:X to ETH staked, with X increasing as the pool earns rewards.
* Lido: Rewards are additional stETH, in the US this is a straight income taxable event. However see wstETH token, this would change the equation: I am thinking capital gains when unwrapping, but talk to your tax accountant, this goes beyond my layman's grasp of taxes.
* RocketPool: Rewards are an increase in the value of the existing rETH, taxable when swapping rETH back to ETH, as capital gains tax in the US.
* For both, staking ETH and getting the token is a taxable event, capital gains, in the US. Ask your tax accountant for more guidance.
* Lido's blog post about getting to trustless, decentralized: [https://blog.lido.fi/the-road-to-trustless-ethereum-staking/](https://blog.lido.fi/the-road-to-trustless-ethereum-staking/).
* RocketPool made an interesting decision not to launch until it was as decentralized as possible. It still has a centralized oDAO for RPL pricing and rETH:ETH ratio, which can also upgrade contracts. The technical reason the oDAO is necessary is that ETH contracts cannot read the state of the beacon chain, validator balances at certain checkpoints, and so on. Once the EVM learns how to get beacon chain data to a contract, the oDAO could potentially be removed, or have its powers curtailed. The pDAO, which doesn't exist yet, [would control protocol parameters](https://medium.com/rocket-pool/rocket-pool-staking-protocol-part-2-e0d346911fe1). I am waiting to understand whether the oDAO controls those today.
* There is some contention that the RP oDAO can do more to mess up the protocol than the Lido DAO can. OTOH Lido NOs do not have a bond, they are curated. Which model makes punishing NOs for behavior harder would be great to discuss in detail in comments! Pieter adds: ""Because of this the RP devs have recently made a big change to make upgrading of certain contracts an [optional choice](https://medium.com/rocket-pool/rocket-pool-prater-testnet-guides-2428ecdc565e) for the NO, so that NOs can always exit funds safely even if the oDAO is compromised. There's also ongoing discussion whether the oDAO could/should have a role after the merge in penalizing NOs who don't share priority fees and MEV rewards with RP appropriately.""

🛠 This week in Elrond (18/07 - 23/07),"&#x200B;

The internet’s evolution into a global information & assets distribution network that is monetized fairly requires payments to be embedded into its fabric.

The  [@ElrondNetwork](https://twitter.com/ElrondNetwork)  protocol is ready to enable that by operating at internet-scale.

Weekly  [\#elrondtech](https://twitter.com/hashtag/elrondtech?src=hashtag_click) 🛠

&#x200B;

[This Week in Elrond](https://preview.redd.it/vxlmypg1icd71.jpg?width=680&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=21be4580dee8abfc876cbf91b98e065147911887)

1/  [The](https://preview.redd.it/vxlmypg1icd71.jpg?width=680&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=21be4580dee8abfc876cbf91b98e065147911887) Maiar Exchange SCs now have Events, which generate an item for each important endpoint called by users, reducing pressure on the Observers’ VM. The DEX cache has been refactored, several metrics added.

&#x200B;

2/ Cross-Shard SC composability will be further enhanced via Promises. We’ve implemented callback gas accumulation, where the gas unspent by an asynchronous call is correctly propagated, completing the gas propagation circuit of Promises.

&#x200B;

3/ Research and proposal of how to add special functions/functionality on top of ESDT Transfer built-in functions. The ESDT/NFT standard is expanded to make sure ESDTs can be used for token type which is taking i.e. commission out of each transfer.

&#x200B;

4/ Other notable achievements:

&#x200B;

* PolyNetwork bridge: work on synchronizing relayer and SC implementations
* Multi-Transfer ESDT integration in Rust framework
* Sell NFT function in Rust framework, which automatically handles creator royalties
* Small fixes on Elrond-Ethereum bridge
* Fixed the import-db process
* Improved the eviction mechanism by creating a new evictionWaitingList implementation that should speed the pruning process by \~100x
* When running the full archive mode, the node will automatically adjust its p2p connection settings
* Fixed the partially implemented timeout mechanism on the new trie syncer. The node will error and restart itself if it won't be able to receive trie nodes in a bounded time
* Finished the integration of elrond-go-core in all projects. Over 100k lines changed
* Multiple tweaks on the API infrastructure, added Microcaching, switched onto KeyDB cluster as a Redis alternative
* Deployed nestjs API on all internal testnets and updated deployment scripts for internal testnets
* Added monitoring and alerting for Kubernetes cluster and API containers
* Finished managed buffers APIs, integration test
* Found and solved bug on ECC + added more Mandos tests, updated benchmarks
* Removed elrond-go dependency from elastic-indexer-go
* Progress on the automated testing framework for Promises
* Improved Arwen wasm VM logs and events by automatically selecting the event notifier as the public function which was called on the function
* Added more options for the log lifespan so that the logs can be split by time, epochs and size
* Added more unit tests to increase code coverage on the bootstrap component
* events driver: added pubkey converter, test with built-in & sc events, started updating with elrond-go-core references, merge dev -> feat/outport driver - fix conflicts
* Small bugfixes on Arwen VM 1.4, simplified a set of calls
* Finished implementation for the job and job-factory smart contracts for human-protocol
* Started work on a service to handle requests for the human-protocol API
* only\_owner endpoint: implementation, tests, fixes, merge in master
* bonding curve module
* Remove [keybase.pub](https://keybase.pub/) dependency from API
* Show transaction logs and SC results logs on transaction details
* Fix ledger infinite sync on first account issue
* Tested different scenarios in Maiar Exchange
* Started an implementation that manages the scheduled root hash for epoch start blocks
* Added unit tests for transactions preprocessor
* Changed the way shard block header is used (instances, casts, etc.), replacing it with ShardHeaderHandler interface, to easily integrate header V2 which is needed for scheduled txs
* Adapt scheduled smart contracts feature to the latest changes in development
* Changed protocol buffers schemas management in elrond-go and elrond-go-core
* High-level mechanism for deploying a contract from another contract, using contract proxies
* Started the integration of managed buffers in Rust contracts
* Further testing of contracts and APIs using both mandos-go and mandos-rs

London Hardfork - ELI5 Edition,"**What is it?** 

A non contentious hard fork to improve Ethereum. This is better described as a network upgrade than a hard fork. 

**When is it?** 

 Block number 12,965,000. Or, more simply, approximately August 4th.

**Who is doing it?**

Everyone. This is a non-contentious fork, meaning that us nerds on Twitter and Reddit aren't fighting about it. 

**Do I get double ETH for FREEEEEEEEE?**

Technically yes. But the old ETH will be worthless, and the new ETH will assume the value that the old ETH had. **ELI5: No.**

**I have a CDP and/or a Vault. What do I need to do?**

Nothing!

**I have stuff locked in Uniswap/dYdX/Compound/whatever. What do I need to do?**

Nothing! 

**My ETH is on an exchange, what do I need to do?**

Nothing! 

**My ETH is in a MEW, Mycrypto, Coinbase Wallet, Argent, paper wallet etc. What do I need to do?**

Nothing!

**My ETH is on a hardware wallet what do I need to do?**

Nothing!

**I got contacted by someone asking for my private key to upgrade my ETH or whatever?**

It's a scam!

**I was contacted by someone with a link to go claim my fork ETH, should I do that?**

Scam!

**I run a node what do I need to do?**

Update it before Tuesday, August 3! But if you don't, you won't lose your ETH or anything so don't stress too much. 

**I mine, what do I need to do?**

Make sure your miner is pointed at the new chain by updating your node.

**I have validator(s) running, what do I need to do?**

Make sure your Eth2 client is pointed at the new chain by updating your eth1 node. Also remember to update your Eth2 node.

**Is this going to increase the price?**

Maybe? 

**Is this the fork where we add EIP-1559?**

YES! This is the big one.

**Is this the fork where we merge and turn off PoW?**

Nope. But it will be the next one. 

**What's this even all about then?**

This hard fork is adding the following Ethereum Improvement Proposals. 

[EIP-1559: Fee market change for ETH 1.0 chain 
](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1559) - A transaction pricing mechanism that includes fixed-per-block network fee that is burned and dynamically expands/contracts block sizes to deal with transient congestion.

[EIP-3198: BASEFEE opcode](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-3198) - Adds an opcode that gives the EVM access to the block’s base fee.

[EIP-3554: Difficulty Bomb Delay to December 2021](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-3554) - Delays the difficulty bomb to show effect the first week of December 2021.

[EIP-3529: Reduction in refunds](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-3529) - Remove gas refunds for SELFDESTRUCT, and reduce gas refunds for SSTORE to a lower level where the refunds are still substantial, but they are no longer high enough for current “exploits” of the refund mechanism to be viable.",270.0,2021-07-24 14:52:26,0.98
"Vision: A Global Stock Exchange Powered by Algorand (MBA paper - warning: long read, very theoretical)","I figured I’d share a few writings (of my groups - with other group mates' permission) from a master’s level (INTRO TO) blockchain class if anyone’s interested in reading about some creative ideas of how Algorand can be used outside of peer-to-peer transactions (I chose Algorand for almost all projects lol – doing my part!). Please take the logic with a grain of salt (there are OBVIOUS gaps in the logic/rationality and issues with the business cases) – these were weekly assignments meant to be creative, spur learning about specific blockchains, and lead to further discussion/polishing of the ideas/logic/tech – not meant to be fully fleshed out, ready-to-execute business plans (and we learned more as the semester went on…). Also, one member of our group was an ESL student so please forgive any grammar/spelling (and we didn’t have the time nor incentive to revise/edit/polish the paper’s spelling/grammar). P.S. This is highly theoretical and some stuff is definitely hand-waved but meant as a fun thought experiment for someone smarter than me and my group mates to actually do - not a raodmap for success with this idea.

———————————

**Current situation and issues**

Stock exchanges play a **crucial role in the society-wide optimization of resources**. Suppliers invest their scarce resources in opportunities they think will provide them the best return now and in the future. Companies transform the funds they believe will best help them meet the demands of goods markets and stakeholders. ​

As of today, globally, this optimization mechanism roughly accounts for 100 trillion USD and synthesizes the interests of governments, financial institutions, banks, pension funds, and ordinary consumers. Around half of the capital exchange happens on stock exchanges located in the U.S. (NYSE/NASDAQ), followed by Japan (7%),  China (5%), and the U.K. (4%). The largest E.U. exchanges in Switzerland, Germany, and France individually contribute around 3% each. ​

There are roughly 60 different exchange platforms worldwide. Depending on their domicile, they may be operating under similar rules and regulations, but mostly this is not the case.​

Stock exchange platforms, even residing in the same country, differ in how they operate in **many technical aspects as they use proprietary software** and how they organize trades (for example, a dealer, market maker organized, vs. auction-based trades).  They usually **differ in** **their requirements to companies** (for example, pre-requisites to be listed, or how the process is organized direct, via middle-man, or both) and **participants allowed for trades**.​

This situation is further complicated by local peculiarities as a stock exchange must deal with **multiple layers of regulation**, including (1) reporting and auditing standards (GAAP in the U.S., IFRS in most EU countries but with local differences, etc.), (2) rules and organization of capital market and trades regulation, (3) investor protection mechanisms (including anti-fraud regulation), (4) antitrust regulation, etc. Cross-country regulation concerning topics such as foreign direct investment, capital flows limitations, and more add another level of complexity. There are some solid efforts for harmonizing areas of regulation (for example, the convergence of IFRS and GAAP, ADR/GDR, etc.). Still, the process takes decades especially when political trends heavily influence its pace.​

All this regulation explains the existence of numerous, fragmented stock exchange platforms and intermediaries. **Niche intermediaries and third parties maintain market operation globally and bridge the gaps of the system created by its inflexible nature**.​

Such intermediaries provide their clients with almost 24/7 access to exchanges during market downtimes (pre-and after-market shares sales, and Tokyo-London-NYC chain), support cross-border transfer ​of capital and FX conversion, offer investors pooling options to realize shares fractioning (for example, Index funds, ETFs), listing options for companies to access market avoiding costly procedures (SPACs, reverse IPO, direct listing), or even bridge to blockchain-based trade platforms (stock tokens).​

The trend for providing **more flexibility/access to capital markets and globalization is quite pronounced**. Technology and competition spurred structural changes in the market that have resulted in higher priority to ordinary clients and the convergence of Main and Wall streets in terms of services. Nevertheless, the whole system comes at a considerable cost (i.e., the securities brokering industry in the U.S. alone is estimated around $200 billion and is projected to grow).​

Finally, despite all the regulation protecting governments and market participants, **breakdowns** **happen** (Enron, World.com, Madoff) because of **reaction time** (to fix loopholes) and **human error**, with or without the support of intermediaries. At the same time, stiff capital flow **barriers get circumvented due to the lack of transparency** (tax evasion, money laundering, inability to recover stolen assets).

**Global DLT-based stock exchange**

Blockchain technology and all the flexibility it provides looks especially appealing for the creation of a genuinely global stock exchange (GSX). ​

First, the **decentralized autonomous organization** (DAO) concept allows the **society to directly define harmonized regulations** and pre-requisites of listing, de-listing, and interaction among participants. It is in their best interest as participants to agree on the optimal balance between regulatory burden and flexibility of the platform. ​

Second, the **regulation can be embedded/scripted in open-source-based platform protocols**, which lessens the need for additional oversight and avoids human input. Some functionality might outsource using smart contracts with third parties (i.e., audit clearance, some regulatory approvals if needed, etc.).​

Third, the **inherent transparency** and **traceability** of the technology **decreases most risks** associated with **any potential illicit activities**. ​

Regulatory authorities, if such involvement is needed, benefit as they have an option to investigate any inconsistencies, fraud, tax avoidance, and clawback suspicious transactions and construct a complete entity ownership structure for tax and antitrust purposes.​

Finally, a GSX implies operating in a **uniform, borderless virtual space open 24/7**. There would be no need in **FX transactions and related intermediaries** to transform share tokens into fiat currency to purchase other digital assets or share tokens. **Fractioning** **is embedded** in the technology. Index/Mutual/ETF/Hedge-like funds can be recreated by pooling individual investors’ tokens or digital shares.​

**Roadblocks**

Although this concept probably presents an idealistic vision, it might be supposed that globalization trends will at some point allow for the creation of such a platform. ​

A truly global equity market will inherently require global consensus and buy-in. Those who align on the design of the GSX will be allowed to participate. Getting governments to cooperate — This will be the first major roadblock. ​

Once design has been accepted, governance will be the next roadblock. Various markets currently operate independently regarding rules and regulations and may clash on certain points when trying to reach a consensus point. Governments will require regulatory clarity and the GSX requires it to operate on a global scale. ​

Operationally, it will be important to make sure GSX can run simultaneously to the current system in place and allow for a quick and efficient shift from the current exchange to GSX. Minimizing technical difficulties and implementing fail safes that allow for quick recovery will be imperative. ​

GSX users (traders) will require a certain amount of anonymity and liquidity. Anonymity to protect trade secrets and positions and liquidity to ensure trades are executable and they will not wind up in a position where a position cannot be opened or closed. ​

GSX’s 24/7 exchange model has a potential for increased volatility. A trader would have to always remain vigilante to minimize risk.​

Lastly is a regulatory roadblock pertaining to the companies listed on the exchange. Allowing companies to create their own market, opens the market to new risks of fraud. One prominent example that can cause concerns for future transgressions is a company similar to that of Theranos, even though it was not publicly traded. Stating they have a certain product, which was not the case and taking investments, nevertheless. ​

We assume that primary GSX barriers are related to (1) potential resistance of governments to pass regulation authority to DAO controlled by market participants, (2) the learning curve associated with investors and financial services institutions need to adopt the technology, formulate and get used to new rules and ways of conducting business (which is especially critical for banks, and other public and private entities). We see fewer obstacles for corporations using GSX as many started experimenting with blockchain-based sources of funding (ICO).​

Understanding these limitations, we conceived the following practically viable example that compromises some freedom of the system to meet the current limitations but serves as a first step in deploying GSX. The technical realization of this example assumes the system’s ability to gradually remove compromises when the time comes.​

**Conceptual aspects of the initial GSX deployment** ​

To address the challenges, first, we propose limiting initial GSX deployment within a few developed countries hosting major stock exchanges, including the U.S., Japan, E.U., and the U.K. All locations receive permissioned co-chains in their domicile. Co-chains are based on a permissionless main blockchain. This combination allows for communication among all co-chains and establishing domicile-specific regulation simultaneously (for example, by minting share tokens in Japan co-chain, they might not be transacted by all other co-chains, but for the U.S.).​

Second, domicile-specific regulatory bodies receive 51% voting rights over the formulation of their respective co-chain regulation. Other rights are distributed according to market capitalization of primary financial services providers (banks, funds, exchange providers). This will allow the voting constituents to reconstruct current regulation and market rules in the GSX space but allows for decentralization at a later date. Also, this approach ensures investors and corporations would not need to invest in adapting to drastically new market mechanics.​

Third, initially, GSX would be prohibited for dual-listing to already traded corporations. Because there will be no significant difference to the adopted regulation at the initial deployment, the GSX Voting authority would need to formulate an elevated/fast track procedure allowing a seamless delisting process for traded corporations from legacy exchanges and relisting on GSX. Although there is a technological ability to tokenize regular corporations’ shares, in our opinion, such an approach contradicts the GSX philosophy (as it would entail the need for a middleman).​

Finally, with time, statutory bodies and other voting parties would be allowed to pass the regulatory authority to investors gradually. Market trends and societal consensus will create pressures for rules harmonization and transition of co-chains over to the main stem. ​

With the system established and functioning as intended, we believe other countries/regions will be incited to participate. At that point, they might opt in for a co-chain route, or simply join the permissionless blockchain.​

**Technology Behind the GSX**

We propose building our GSX on the Algorand blockchain. Algorand’s **pure proof of stake** consensus mechanism is well suited for this type of project. ​

First, Algorand boasts *immediate transaction finality,* an important characteristic for a financial market operating on a global scale. With other blockchains, it’s highly recommended that a receiver of funds wait for more blocks to be posted so they can ensure that their transaction occurred on the “true” chain. Should you complete a transaction that occurred on the failed side of a fork your transaction will be deleted, and funds reset, as soon as the network rejects this “dead chain.” As Algorand’s founder, Silvio Micali, explains, “…rather than waiting ten minutes (Bitcoin’s transaction time) to have reasonable confidence in the finality of a transaction, in reality you have to wait hours. In contrast, the Algorand blockchain never forks. Two blocks can never be added to the chain at once because only one block can have the required threshold of committee votes. At most, one block is certified and written to the chain in a given round. Accordingly, all transactions are final in Algorand.”​

Another benefit of Algorand is that this finality **doesn’t come at the cost of speed or money**. In 2021, Algorand claims that block finality will shrink to just 2.5 seconds and transaction capability will increase to 46,000 transactions per second. This speed comes at a cost of just .001 Algos (currently about .00134 USD) compared to the average transaction fee of similar blockchains such as Ethereum (.0034 ETH or 9.95 USD) and Cardano (.16 ADA or .21 USD) \[Note: all transactions costs discussed were calculated at time of writing – May 2021\].​

Along with this underlying technology comes layer 1 solutions that are necessary to run a system like a global stock exchange. The Alogrand Standard Asset (ASA) — Alogrand’s non-fungible token (NFT) — allows for what Silvio Micali deems “Universal Tokenization.” Any asset class can be tokenized on the Algorand chain at global scale and at minimal cost to mint. Algorand also offers layer 1 smart contracts, clawback functionality, and oracle capabilities that enable a wide array of financial solutions such as algorithm-based trading, insurance policies, etc. and making regulatory requirements, taxation, interest payments, etc. easier to accomplish.​

Finally, Algorand allows for permissioned co-chains that operate on the Alogrand main chain and seamlessly integrate with other co-chains and provide all the functionality and benefits mentioned above but with the ability to manage the chain’s governance and protocols as the owner of the chain sees fit. ​

**Governance and Operation of the Proposed System**

As mentioned previously, we would have country’s each build **permissioned co-chains** to host the exchanges for their respective jurisdictions. These co-chains would transact in a digitized form of the country’s fiat currency (e.g. a CBDC or stable-coin) but seamlessly interact through Algos (the main chain’s currency). We chose this due to legal, regulatory, and taxation purposes — because most country’s laws/regulations are currently written in terms of a country’s fiat currency (e.g. “companies of market caps over some amount of USD…” “Accredited investors are those with a net worth of greater than some amount of USD…” etc.) Our hope, and ultimate goal, is to have the system eventually run on Algos, as a unified global currency, however, we understand that we need to slowly ramp up to this.​

These co-chains would be operated by permissioned nodes and governed by chosen holders of governance tokens. Importantly, the choosing of nodes and distribution of these tokens would be left to the countries to decide. However, we recommend that 51% of the nodes be operated by (and 51% of the governance tokens go to) regulatory bodies. This will allow nation-states to control the protocol and network — assuaging fears of lost autonomy or economic/national security threats. This would also allow them to embed regulations and laws into the co-chain’s protocol, greatly reducing the chance of bad actors. We recommend the remaining 49% of both network nodes and governance tokens be distributed to primary financial service providers (banks, funds, legacy exchanges) proportionally to their current market capitalizations, giving them a stake in the system and providing some  replacement for lost power (e.g. the NYSE will be a major loser if this GSX occurs, thus giving them node-status and a stake in governance ensures a continuity plan for the NYSE, its employees, and its stakeholders). Node operators would earn fees on transactions, thus replacing the lost revenues of legacy players and providing the government revenues (and possibly replacing legacy forms of taxation). ​

This approach should also calm and reassure investors and corporations as they would not need to invest in adapting to drastically new market mechanics.​

**The End Game**

Our dream is that eventually each co-chain operates using the Algo (Algorand’s native currency) as a worldwide accepted currency and that these co-chains merge into a GSX co-chain and the governance and operation of the GSX becomes decentralized. However, we understand that in order to achieve this ambitious vision, onboarding of countries onto the GSX and establishing its value as a replacement of legacy systems will be key and the only way to do so will be to emulate the current system in a blockchain environment while taking advantage of blockchain-derived benefits that will show, not tell, the value this type of system can bring. We believe that after using our GSX, countries, market participants, and the general population will begin to see the benefits of a blockchain-based, decentralized global market and will soon move toward this vision.​

EIP 3554 or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the (Difficulty) Bomb,"Believe it or not, there exist EIPs that aren't numbered ""1559,"" and we're shining the light on a little discussed part of the upcoming London hard fork – EIP 3554.

EIP 3554 will delay the difficulty bomb on Ethereum until December when PoS can \*hopefully\* be merged in.

But what's the reason for the delay? Why don't we just remove the difficulty bomb so we don't have to worry about it?

You might be wondering,

**What is the difficulty bomb to begin with?**

The difficulty bomb is a built in function that exponentially ""explodes"" block times after a certain difficulty level is met. When it explodes, the usability of Ethereum goes to 0 as transactions slow to a crawl. It's happened before in 2017 and twice in 2019.

https://preview.redd.it/lzeph7dvulb71.png?width=1200&format=png&auto=webp&s=03193e019118c9ca7189eee532f1a2dd65d06c4a

&#x200B;

**So, what are the benefits?**

There are a couple:

The first is that, EIP 3554 is a defense against attackers that fork Ethereum. Although changing the code is relatively simple, distributing clients (like ours) that ship with the code change is very difficult. This is where Ethereum's multi-client system shines – if it's a hostile fork, it's convincing one client team isn't the end of the story, you need to ask all of the major clients.

The other benefit is that, it ensures there is continued maintenance and urgency for changes. If allcoredevs drag their feet with implementing changes, the difficulty bomb sets in and Ethereum becomes unusable.

This is what Tim Beiko of the Ethereum Foundation had to say about this:

[https://twitter.com/TimBeiko/status/1414635059324198913?s=20](https://twitter.com/TimBeiko/status/1414635059324198913?s=20)

>For better or worse, I suspect London would have shipped 1-6 months later if it were not for the difficulty bomb.

Finally and perhaps most importantly, when the merge happens, it'll encourage everyone to hop onto the Proof of Stake system, or else they risk staying on a chain that is unusable.

This was the original reason that this was put in, as miners wouldn't be able to pretend that PoS would be implemented.

Do you think the difficulty bomb is worth keeping on even on PoS?

“Is this a bear market or a mid cycle pullback?” Maybe you’re asking the wrong question.,"Exactly four years ago I was in a scenario which I am sure that many of you will find yourself in right now. As you all will know quite well by now, crypto has been crashing. As of July 2021, price of ETH has plummeted from $4,200 to the high $1,000s after running up from last year’s lows of around $100. Now let’s flashback to exactly 4 years ago. It’s mid July 2017 and I was getting very concerned about my first ever investment, Ether. ETH just dropped from $420 to $135 over the course of a few weeks and I bought on the way up between $220 and $420.

>*Sidenote isn’t it incredible just how similar those numbers are and they’re exactly 4 years apart?* 

>*2017: $10 --> $420 --> $140 --> $1,400.*

>*2020/2021?: $100 --> $4,200 --> $1,700? [We are here] $1,400? --> $14K?*

So why did I stick around? Well, I asked myself one simple question:

>Has anything changed about Ethereum fundamentally that would make it less likely to succeed in the long run?

Let’s answer that question now:

* ETH 2.0 beacon chain running smoothly and still locking up more ETH daily? ✅ 6.28 million ETH locked and counting.
* EIP-1559 fee burning still on it’s way? ✅ It’s only 3 weeks away now. 🔥🔥🔥
* Still the largest blockchain in terms of enterprise partnerships and enterprise adoption? ✅
* Still home of the vast majority of funds in DeFi apps? ✅
* Layer 2 scaling rolling out? ✅ Optimism just went live and Polygon is getting enormous.

And most importantly in my opinion:

* Is the ETH 1 + 2.0 Proof of Stake merge (aka the “triple halving”) just around the corner?  ✅

Based on all of the above, what we have is a 60% pullback with no good reason to believe that the long term success of Ethereum is in jeopardy. If you saw the charts without any context, one might expect that something would have happened, maybe a large DeFi hack or devs announcing some seemingly insurmountable roadblocks for ETH 2.0, but no. Ethereum is bigger and better than ever. In fact, the same is true for most legitimate cryptos.

Now I don’t know if price will recover in the short term, since the current price charts look similar to both right after the 2018 bubble as well as July 2017. One was proceeded by a lengthy bear market and the other, another 10x price run up from the low. However, what I do know is that if you’re in this for the long run, you need not be concerned. Trust me, the pain you’re going through now will be nothing to the pain you will feel if you sell now and see ETH at $50,000 in 20 years’ time. As for the medium term, I am still extremely bullish on ETH. As I mentioned above, the ETH 2.0 merge is on its way. Even if it doesn’t launch as expected in Q1 2022, at some point before the end of next year, it is extremely likely that Ethereum will experience a 90% drop in its inflation and a 100% drop in ETH going to miners. Now for those of you who don’t know, miners create constant selling pressure because they have to sell their crypto to pay for their electricity bills. It’s a business with surprisingly slim profit margins for most. So what happens when Ethereum goes from $20-$50 million dollars of daily selling pressure from miners to $0? (the 0.5% inflation going to stakers will still be locked up until a later ETH 2 upgrade). Well based on Bitcoin’s history, ETH price will rise like crazy. I mean, it’s literally a triple fucking halving! 3x the effect of that thing which has started a Bitcoin bull run every time without fail.

**TL;DR:** In the short term anything can happen. We could enter a 2018 bear market, or we could do what we did in 2017 as I also laid out above. Anyone showing you a chart explaining why they are right is just cherry picking data. You can make valid arguments both ways. The only thing we do know is that the fundamentals of most legitimate cryptos and especially ETH are stronger than ever yet the price is not reflecting this. This means that if you’re investing for the long term, then buying here is a wise decision. After all, there is a 60% sale on the asset you were fomoing into 2 months ago when it’s fundamentals are stronger than ever!",310.0,2021-07-14 10:00:46,0.98

So why did I stick around? Well, I asked myself one simple question:

>Has anything changed about Ethereum fundamentally that would make it less likely to succeed in the long run?

Let’s answer that question now:

* ETH 2.0 beacon chain running smoothly and still locking up more ETH daily? ✅ 6.28 million ETH locked and counting.
* EIP-1559 fee burning still on it’s way? ✅ It’s only 3 weeks away now. 🔥🔥🔥
* Still the largest blockchain in terms of enterprise partnerships and enterprise adoption? ✅
* Still home of the vast majority of funds in DeFi apps? ✅
* Layer 2 scaling rolling out? ✅ Optimism just went live and Polygon is getting enormous.

And most importantly in my opinion:

* Is the ETH 1 + 2.0 Proof of Stake merge (aka the “triple halving”) just around the corner?  ✅

Based on all of the above, what we have is a 60% pullback with no good reason to believe that the long term success of Ethereum is in jeopardy. If you saw the charts without any context, one might expect that something would have happened, maybe a large DeFi hack or devs announcing some seemingly insurmountable roadblocks for ETH 2.0, but no. Ethereum is bigger and better than ever. In fact, the same is true for most legitimate cryptos.

Now I don’t know if price will recover in the short term, since the current price charts look similar to both right after the 2018 bubble as well as July 2017. One was proceeded by a lengthy bear market and the other, another 10x price run up from the low. However, what I do know is that if you’re in this for the long run, you need not be concerned. Trust me, the pain you’re going through now will be nothing to the pain you will feel if you sell now and see ETH at $50,000 in 20 years’ time. As for the medium term, I am still extremely bullish on ETH. As I mentioned above, the ETH 2.0 merge is on its way. Even if it doesn’t launch as expected in Q1 2022, at some point before the end of next year, it is extremely likely that Ethereum will experience a 90% drop in its inflation and a 100% drop in ETH going to miners. Now for those of you who don’t know, miners create constant selling pressure because they have to sell their crypto to pay for their electricity bills. It’s a business with surprisingly slim profit margins for most. So what happens when Ethereum goes from $20-$50 million dollars of daily selling pressure from miners to $0? (the 0.5% inflation going to stakers will still be locked up until a later ETH 2 upgrade). Well based on Bitcoin’s history, ETH price will rise like crazy. I mean, it’s literally a triple fucking halving! 3x the effect of that thing which has started a Bitcoin bull run every time without fail.

**TL;DR:** In the short term anything can happen. We could enter a 2018 bear market, or we could do what we did in 2017 as I also laid out above. Anyone showing you a chart explaining why they are right is just cherry picking data. You can make valid arguments both ways. The only thing we do know is that the fundamentals of most legitimate cryptos and especially ETH are stronger than ever yet the price is not reflecting this. This means that if you’re investing for the long term, then buying here is a wise decision. After all, there is a 60% sale on the asset you were fomoing into 2 months ago when it’s fundamentals are stronger than ever!",324.0,2021-07-14 09:54:57,0.92
“Is this a bear market or a mid cycle pullback?” Maybe you’re asking the wrong question.,"Exactly four years ago I was in a scenario which I am sure that many of you will find yourself in right now. As you all will know quite well by now, crypto has been crashing. As of July 2021, price of ETH has plummeted from $4,200 to the high $1,000s after running up from last year’s lows of around $100. Now let’s flashback to exactly 4 years ago. It’s mid July 2017 and I was getting very concerned about my first ever investment, Ether. ETH just dropped from $420 to $135 over the course of a few weeks and I bought on the way up between $220 and $420.

BAT on Cardano?,"I was going to send my BAT to a lending platform to start earning interest on it, but the fee to send it was literally over half the amount I'm trying to send! I'm assuming this has to do with the fact that BAT is an ERC-20 token and exists on Ethereum which is notorious for its tremendous gas fees as more people have started to use the network.

When Cardano launches the ERC-20 token converter and has smart contracts running on the main--net, is there any possibility of BAT switching over? I'd be curious if anyone has heard any of the BAT team comment on this. I think this would be mutually beneficial for both projects. Particularly, this even being discussed as a possibility would provide really good attention for BAT and increase user adoption for the Brace browser.

As far as I know, Ethereum doesn't have a scheduled date for ETH 2.0, so maybe this would be a good idea to discuss. I hope nobody takes this as me hating on Ethereum. I think what they've accomplished is absolutely insane and Vitalik is a genius. I hope the merge goes smoothly, but I also see an extremely bright future for Cardano.

DOGE is merge-mined with Litecoin; here's what it means," 

## DOGE is merge-mined with Litecoin; here's what it means

**Both Gurbacs and Mow have reminded the eccentric Tesla CEO that the meme-coin he favors and intends to make ""better than Bitcoin and Ethereum"" has an important problem.**

**Back in September 2014, Dogecoin switched to auxiliary proof of work (Auxiliary PoW) consensus protocol using the Scrypt algorithm and became mined together with Litecoin.**

**DOGE devs had to conduct a hard fork for that, but that step saved the coin from a declining hashrate and a potential 51 percent attack. This step was caused by quickly declining DOGE miner rewards by that time.**

**Besides, Dogecoin initially came to exist after a Litecoin hard fork. It was LTC creator Charlie Lee who suggested merged mining with LTC to save DOGE. After that, the DOGE hashrate rose over 1,500 percent in just one month.**

**Merge mining can be done for a parent blockchain, which is Litecoin in this case, and a child blockchain, Dogecoin. If DOGE devs decide to make fundamental changes regarding transaction speed and miner rewards, they would first have to make a hard fork to get away from merge-mining with LTC.**

"Let's clear up the facts around EIP-1559, the merge/triple halving and ЕТН becoming a deflationary asset.","I'm finding it incredible just how many people in crypto are confusing the triple halvening/cliffening which comes with the merge and EIP-1559. I have seen multiple YouTubers (and not the shitty bybit link shilling, shitcoin pumping kind) and many people on Reddit thinking that the cliffening is happening in the next month with EIP-1559. The amount of misinformation is frustrating. People are going to look at EIP-1559's respectable change to ETH supply (but not dramatic like the merge) and claim ""oOh, LoOk, EIP-1559 diDn'T MaKe eThEReuM DefLaTioNaRy!"" When in reality, EIP-1559 was never going to make ETH deflationary except for when gas fees were well into the hundreds of Gwei, something which is unlikely to last now that layer twos are taking off.

Anyway, let me clarify for anyone who is still unsure:

- **EIP-1559** will reduce the ETH going to miners by an estimated 30% and burn most of the transaction fees going forwards (it will also make gas fees *a lot* more stable. No more guessing what to pay to get into the next block!). This means ~30% less constant selling pressure from miners and anywhere between 0.5 and 5% of the ETH supply being burned each year. Most likely about 1-2% of supply per year based on gas fees over the last year. This would still leave ETH with a net inflation rate of about 1.5-3%.

- **The Merge/The triple halvening/the cliffening** or whatever you want to call it is the move from Proof of Work to Proof of Stake. To do this, we will be merging the ETH 1 PoW blockchain with the ETH 2.0 PoS blockchain (which currently is running in parallel and has no transactional functionality, just staking, so if you stake your ETH, you're moving it to ETH 2 and waiting for a future update to allow for full transactional functionality on ETH 2.0). This upgrade will result in a reduction of annual ETH issuance from 4.5%pa to 0.5%pa since miners no longer need to be paid for all of the electricity they waste when securing the network It is also worth noting that after the merge, Ethereum will be the most secure and most decentralised blockchain with its over 150,000 validators and greater security guarantees from Proof of Stake due to the ability to slash (punish) bad actors. When combined with EIP-1559, this will result in ETH becoming deflationary or ""ultra sound money"" since the fees burned through EIP-1559 will be greater in value than new ETH given to validators/stakers. This upgrade is currently looking like it will go live in Q1 2022.

Finally, I would like to give my own 2 wei on the effects of these upgrades. For over a decade now the crypto market cycles have revolved around the Bitcoin halvings when the supply of new coins going to miners halves. This is important because miners are majority sellers. They have electricity bills to pay and so the inflation from new coins is almost always being dumped on the market. If halving this amount can consistently create a parabolic run, then what do you think will happen when Ethereum gets rid of it entirely? There will be no automatic sellers and what little ETH is given to validators will be less likely to be sold as stakers by nature are ETH holders and don't have electricity costs to offset. Meanwhile, ETH is still sitting at a middle ground ETH/BTC ratio compared to the low and its 2017 highs set in a time when ETH had no apps, no DeFi, barely any NFTs except crypto punks, ETH 2.0 and PoS were still a pipe dream and there were no layer 2 scaling solutions.

"600,000 ETH Transfer from Binance to Private Wallet Appears Legit and NOT an internal Binance transfer. Glass node data supports a negative 1.5B net flow of ETH yesterday. ETH is now officially at an ATL on exchanges not seen since 2018","&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/x5vc96qliy871.png?width=1421&format=png&auto=webp&s=345684d0777db76b32a255898cf575a08e62b73a

On 7/1/21, a private wallet with no prior transactions received a 600,000k ETH transfer  at $2,155.65 / ETH from Binance in a matter of second for 64cents. 

You can see the whale alert here: [https://whale-alert.io/transaction/ethereum/9cd7c6565a794d2716a42848324bb41479c7194c0506837588455dd66b244c6f](https://whale-alert.io/transaction/ethereum/9cd7c6565a794d2716a42848324bb41479c7194c0506837588455dd66b244c6f)

&#x200B;

This transaction brought about a lot of discussion on crypto twitter and Reddit regarding if it was an internal transfer to a new Binance wallet or if it was a real off chain move. 

A review of the glass node data for the past 24hr indicates that the ETH blockchain had a negative net flow of 1.2 BILLION with total outflow of 1.5 BILLION. This is strongly suggestive that the 600k ETH transaction was real and not an internal transfer. Diving into the glass node data, we can see that this 1.2B net negative outflow is one of the largest netflows seen on chain in the past few months.

A negative net flow of this degree hasnt been seen since 5/19/21 when cascading liquidations caused the price of ether to plummet and lead to significant accumulation. Futhermore, when looking at the Santiment analytics data for ETH supply on exchange, you can see that a supply squeeze is slowly occuring on chain...suggestive that the price of ETH may increase in the near future.

Lastly, the flippening is beginning as yesterday (7.2.21), the number of active ETH addresses actually SURPASSED active BTC addresses for the first time in history.  Given the number of upcominging positive changes to the ETH network (lower gas fees thanks to the Berlin upgrade, improved transaction speed via side chains and rollups, and EIP 1559 + Merge), ETH maxis have a lot to look forward to.

Scalability roadmap cheat sheet (July 2021 update),"Following clarifications from the AMA, here are some updated numbers.

|*TPS*|Now|London (July/Aug 2021)|The Merge (Early 2022)|64 data shards (Late 2022?)|Statelessness + state expiry (Late 2022 onwards?)|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Ethereum|16-54|16-54 (2x burst henceforth)|18-60|20-65|70-200|
|Rollup chains|1,000-4,500|1,000-4,500 (2x burst henceforth)|1,100-5,000|20,000-85,000|20,000-85,000|

TPS is a confusing metric and depends greatly on the complexity of transactions, but here we're considering a range: average to simple token transfers. Currently, this is 16 TPS on average including complex DeFi & NFT transactions, but 54 TPS for ETH transfers on Ethereum mainnet. On rollups, there could potentially be even simpler transactions, and further aggregations of transactions (especially with zk rollups), but posting conservative estimates here. The numbers are over all rollups combined, assuming all activity moved to rollups.

Post EIP-1559, the network will be able to double throughput by upto 2x for a limited amount of time, while gas prices stabilize. I've only mentioned this under London, but it applies across the board after that, including rollups. Interestingly, data shards also have a similar mechanism where the max data is 2x target. So, rollups will be able to do up to 170,000 TPS in bursts.

I've extrapolated block gas limit increments from past history. Curiously, since genesis, Ethereum's gas limit increase over time has been close to linear, with R^(2) = 0.92 for a linear trend fit. While there's nothing planned currently, it's reasonable to assume that as the protocol matures, clients optimize and hardware costs reduce, there'll be incremental increases to gas limits. Statelessness + state expiry happens in stages, so we may not see the gas limits increased caused by it straight away. Alternatively, there may not be a gas limit increase at all, instead focusing on driving down system requirements to run an Ethereum client very low. But the current expectation is to find a balance, so I'm assuming a 3x increase.

I've simplified this table to what we know. In addition, you have solutions like validium (e.g. zkPorter), sidechains and state channels which can accelerate things further. It all depends on the centralization trade-offs, though it should be noted that validium options are significantly more secure than sidechains.

Beyond this roadmap, data shards will continue to expand beyond 64. At the max spec of 1,024 shards, we'll see over 1 million TPS over all rollups combined - without even considering enhancements to each shard. What about the L1, then? Things are uncertain, as clearly rollups + data shards are the best solution to blockchain scalability at this time. Rollups didn't exist 3 years ago, and now the entire roadmap revolves around rollups. By the time the above roadmap is completed in 2-3 years, who knows where tech will be?",96.0,2021-07-02 19:45:04,1.0
List of non-custodial Ethereum Staking Services,"I put together a list of non-custodial, retail-oriented, staking services as part of my own research and thought I would share them.  There are some institutional ones I did not bother listing (eg. Bison Trails, CodeFi, etc), since they can only be setup by making an appointment with a rep and the fees likely will be much higher than the retail focused ones anyway.   In all of them except one, the user only holds the withdrawal key and the service is the only one with the validator key.  The one exception is BloxStaking, where the user is the only one that has BOTH keys and signing is done via a KeyVault. This setup makes it easy to migrate to another staking service or transition to your own node eventually. With all the other services, this is not possible and you would need to withdraw all the ETH and repeat the process. Since withdrawals are over a year away, that means you basically locked in with whatever service you pick until then (except BloxStaking).

Three of them support Ledger Withdrawals (where the Ledger HW wallet manages your withdrawal key) which is a nice feature, since it one less seed in which you’ll need to keep track.  Two of the services (Staked.US & Stake.Fish) offer a one-time fee per validator until withdrawals are activated, which can be a good deal since it unlikely withdrawals will be activated until the second half of 2022 (since it will be in the next hard form after the merge). The rest charge monthly fees.

I am curious what other people’s experiences (good and bad) with these services.   The only service I know where there were slashing incidents is Staked.US earlier in the year, though my understanding is they agreed to make the effected users whole.  


Stakewise Solo: $10/mo/validator (only paid in DAI), Ledger withdrawal compatible

BloxStaking: ~$10/mo (Blox is free currently, but AWS fee is ~$10/mo. Only service where user holds both withdrawal & validator key and Blox none (uses a KeyVault system)

Stake.Fish: 0.1 ETH/validator one-time payment until withdrawals enabled, Ledger withdrawal compatible. No monthly plan currently.

Staked.US: $19/mo/validator OR $299/validator one-time payment until withdrawals enabled, Ledger withdrawal compatible

AllNodes: $5/month/validator (least expensive plan)

Attestant: 17.5% of Staking rewards, invoiced quarterly and paid in ETH

MIDL.DEV: $45/validator for 1st validator, then $10/each for 2-10, then call for special pricing for over 10 validators

Beyond L1 and L2: a new paradigm of blockchain construction,"A bit of a riff on [my previous post about this topic](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/o39zi3/a_new_era_of_blockchain_departmentalization/).

As a short recap: we're heading into a new paradigm where a blockchain's three broad functions: consensus (or security), data availability and execution can be split arbitrarily. Obviously, large swaths of this post are oversimplified, but it should help you understand this new paradigm. For a more detailed and accurate understanding, please look up these individual constructions. So here are some ways the blockchains of the future could work. All of this definitely has a better presentation in graphical form, but I only do text so here it is. Please feel free to adapt accordingly!

# Monolithic

This is how blockchains works currently. They do all of their security, data availability and execution themselves. We have other precursor setups like merge-mined chains, commitchains, but by and large they still fall under the monolithic variety. The key question is: can you reconstruct the state of your chain 1 from another chain 0 if your chain 1 fails? If the answer is no, then it's a monolithic chain.

Consensus, data availability and execution: all on chain 0.

Examples: Bitcoin, Ethereum, Polygon PoS.

Within the monolithic category, we have multi-chain ecosystems like Cosmos where multiple monolithic chains split the same validator set. Or sharded ecosystems like Polkadot, where multiple chains share the same validator set.

# Rollups

Rollups only do execution, while relying on a different chain for security and data availability. (Note: rollups and similar constructions do have full nodes, but these are not *required* for security.)

Execution: chain 1; consensus and data availability: chain 0.

Example: Arbitrum One, zkSync 2.0. Execution on Arbitrum One, security and data availability by Ethereum.

So far, monolithic blockchains are called L1, and rollups L2. But we have all sorts of other constructions possible now! I do have a potential nomenclature system in mind, but that's for another time.

# Validium

zk rollups that have data availability on a different chain or committee (so they are no longer rollups). The advantage here is that while you're still relying on the data availability chain, they have significantly limited authority as state root transitions are proved on chain 0. So the consensus mechanism on the data availability chain could freeze your funds, they'd never be able to reorg.

Execution: chain 1; consensus: chain 0; data availability: chain 2.

Example: DeversiFi. Execution: DeversiFi; consensus: Ethereum; data availability: DeversiFi's committee.

While in this above example the operators of the execution chain also run the data availability consensus mechanism, this could be an entirely different chain. For example, zkPorter could use Celestia, Solana or Avail for their data availability instead of zkPorter's own consensus mechanism.

Another possibility is centralized validiums, where complete data availability is held by a centalized entity. Hypothetical example: A centralized DeFi chain run by a CEX or financial institution, where they are responsible for complete data availability in centralized databases, but interact with Ethereum smart contracts and commit state transitions to Ethereum mainnet. The advantage here is they can offer very cheap fees while also offering some degree of security and interoperability with public Ethereum.

# Data availability

A new breed of L1s with no execution layers, focused entirely on data availability for other chains. They have their own consensus mechanisms purely for data. It's important to note these chains are useless by themselves, and need other execution chains - whether monolithic or validiums - to leverage them.

Examples: Celestia, Avail, Ethereum data shards. (Though Ethereum data shards will share consensus mechanism with its execution layer.)

# Volition

These are zk rollups which have both rollup and validium modes, with data availability on two separate chains, so users or smart contract developers can choose.

Execution: chain 1; consensus: chain 0; data availability: chain 0 (rollup mode), chain 2 (validium mode).

Example: zkSync 2.0. Execution: zkSync 2.0; consensus: Ethereum; data availability: Ethereum (rollup mode), zkPorter (validium mode).

# Adamantium

This is part of volition: users can choose to provide their own data availability instead of choosing a chain or committee. I can see this being used by financial institutions, service providers, CEXs etc. Unlike a centralized validium, they wouldn't need to run their own chain: just use an already existing validium but choose to not pay fees for data availability.

# Multi-volition

I just made this up, no such chains exist, and it's unclear if there ever will. You could say adamantium is part of a setup like this. This is very much like volition, except they use an arbitrary number of chains for data availability.

Execution: chain 1; consensus: chain 0; data availability: chain 0, 2, 3...n.

How this would work: Users on the chain select between, say, Ethereum, Solana, Celestia and Avail for data availability; or a committee, or even themselves (admantium). Each of these may have different security and cost trade-offs. State transitions will always be commmitted to chain 0, Ethereum, but data availability can be split across multiple chains.

Smart contract developers may also choose to use multiple chains for data availability within this volition, so it's abstracted away from users. For example: A massive game like Fortnite would want to keep most of their data on centralized servers, but perhaps commit high-value NFTs to Ethereum, low-value NFTs to zkPorter etc.

Or, it could be used for redundancy. E.g. a validium may choose to commit on both Avail and Celestia, so if either fails, there's still a backup. There are some issues around finality, but I think it could be worked out. Potentially, despite paying for both, it could still be significantly cheaper than Ethereum.

# Volition-like monolithic

Monolithic chains might choose to branch out by using other chains for data availability, while still maintaining its own consensus mechanism.

Execution: chain 1; consensus: chain 1; data availability: chain 1, 2 (or 3...n).

Currently, no such chain exists, but Polygon has some in the works. These will be sidechains with their own consensus mechanisms, but use Avail for data availability.

As a side note, a monolithic chain can abandons its consensus mechanism and become a rollup. Or keep its consensus mechanism around just for data availability, but post state transitions to a more secure chain, which would make it a validium.

# Security chains

While this doesn't currently exist, the concept here is that L1 no longer has an execution layer: just a consensus mechanism and a minimal data layer that only hosts state transitions and proofs from execution chains (and other simple things like transfers, consensus data etc.), or perhaps coordinates with an execution chain.

Polkadot's relay chain and Ethereum's beacon chain are *kind of* like this. I don't really see the point of a new chain like this, though, as building a secure consensus mechanism is far and away the hardest part.

# zk-monolithic

This is a variant of the traditional monolithic chain with its own consensus mechanism, except its execution layer is a zkVM. So, it still does everything itself, but can get some of the benefits of zk rollups.

Examples: Mina and Aleo; Ethereum in the distant future.

Tl;dr: The future of blockchain is different types of constructions with varying degrees of centralization/decentralization. L1 was the first primitive, L2s are next, and it's just going to expand from there. Above are just some examples, but there's going to be a vast number of combinations possible in a multi-chain, multi-layered, departmentalized blockchain world.

Notes from the Ethereum Foundation’s Research Team AMA,"
This is by no means a comprehensive list, but just some interesting highlights. Many of these I already knew, some new things I learned about, and some that were clarified. Some of them are accompanied by my thoughts, it should be clear when that's the case. Full AMA here: [https://np.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/o4unlp/ama\_we\_are\_the\_efs\_research\_team\_pt\_6\_23\_june\_2021/](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/o4unlp/ama_we_are_the_efs_research_team_pt_6_23_june_2021/)

\- [You can withdraw balances in excess of 32 ETH](https://np.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/o4unlp/ama_we_are_the_efs_research_team_pt_6_23_june_2021/h2ri0l0/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=web2x&context=3), and [transfer funds above the 32 ETH staked to other addresses](https://np.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/o4unlp/ama_we_are_the_efs_research_team_pt_6_23_june_2021/h2rhj4r/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=web2x&context=3). Withdrawals will happen the first hardfork post-The Merge, though it's unclear when transfers are enabled.

\- [Data sharding does flip the trilemma on its head](https://np.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/o4unlp/ama_we_are_the_efs_research_team_pt_6_23_june_2021/h2rj274/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=web2x&context=3), and you'd need a massively decentralized protocol with a million validators to enable this type of scaling. Delegated-type chains with limited validator sets, usually in the hundreds, to at most a couple of thousand, will never achieve this level of data availability securely. With 175,000 validators now and growing at a maximum rate of 900/day, Ethereum is uniquely positioned to offer massive data availability for rollups.

\- There are [significant trade-offs to reducing the minimum staking amount](https://np.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/o4unlp/ama_we_are_the_efs_research_team_pt_6_23_june_2021/h2rheah/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=web2x&context=3), but interestingly, using zk-SNARKs we can have a new class of lightweight validators called aggregators.

\- [Secret shared validators](https://np.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/o4unlp/ama_we_are_the_efs_research_team_pt_6_23_june_2021/h2rhv7z/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) are making great progress, and enables multiple different people to get together and run validators within each 32 ETH. I definitely look forward to decentralized protocols built around SSVs.

\- As alluded to before, another incentive to lower the staking requirement is [having more validators enables more shards](https://np.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/o4unlp/ama_we_are_the_efs_research_team_pt_6_23_june_2021/h2rhv95/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=web2x&context=3).

\- Danny Ryan is excited about [universal login across the internet](https://np.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/o4unlp/ama_we_are_the_efs_research_team_pt_6_23_june_2021/h2ril56/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) with your ethereum address. Both Danny and Justin are hyped for EIP-1559, but Justin is also [looking forward to smart contract rollups](https://np.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/o4unlp/ama_we_are_the_efs_research_team_pt_6_23_june_2021/h2riek8/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) like Arbitrum, Optimistic Ethereum and zkSync 2.0.

\- Looking into the future decades out, both [Vitalik](https://np.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/o4unlp/ama_we_are_the_efs_research_team_pt_6_23_june_2021/h2rhawh/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)and [Justin](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/o4unlp/ama_we_are_the_efs_research_team_pt_6_23_june_2021/h2ric0r/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) consider Indistinguishability Obfuscation as the next revolution. One potential application is [trustlessly bridging Bitcoin and Ethereum](https://np.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/o4unlp/ama_we_are_the_efs_research_team_pt_6_23_june_2021/h2rp45i/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) without actually requiring any support from the Bitcoin side. Vitalik is also excited for fully homomorphic encryption, which will be useful before IO. Both Vitalik and Justin think there's still significant room for ZK-SNARKs to improve and mature, and will continue to drive innovation in the near term.

\- Statelessness and state expiry may [enable a 2x-3x scalability improvement](https://np.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/o4unlp/ama_we_are_the_efs_research_team_pt_6_23_june_2021/h2rhfou/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=web2x&context=3), but they also may want to use those gains to make running nodes much easier.

\- The [goal is to not rely on SSDs](https://np.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/o4unlp/ama_we_are_the_efs_research_team_pt_6_23_june_2021/h2ridhd/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=web2x&context=3), and make running Ethereum easy for the average user. With stateless clients, you could even run an Ethereum node on a budget HDD-based system. However, SSDs will still be required for block producers and state providers, so [decreasing SSD costs will lead to scalability improvements over time](https://np.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/o4unlp/ama_we_are_the_efs_research_team_pt_6_23_june_2021/h2rjvlp/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=web2x&context=3).

\- Vitalik is no longer following Austrian or Chicago schools of economics, [instead going his own way](https://np.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/o4unlp/ama_we_are_the_efs_research_team_pt_6_23_june_2021/h2rhhg3/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) with models like quadratic funding.

\- The EVM is [currently ""needlessly unfriendly"" to rollups](https://np.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/o4unlp/ama_we_are_the_efs_research_team_pt_6_23_june_2021/h2ri1n0/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=web2x&context=3), and some minor tweaks could make things much easier for optimistic rollups. For ZK rollups, more radical changes are needed on the L1 side.

\- Very interesting question about oracles, but Barnabé Monnot sees it as [better addressed by the application layer](https://np.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/o4unlp/ama_we_are_the_efs_research_team_pt_6_23_june_2021/h2ro33m/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=web2x&context=3).

\- Each [data shard will have independent gas markets](https://np.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/o4unlp/ama_we_are_the_efs_research_team_pt_6_23_june_2021/h2rkp4y/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=web2x&context=3), and follow an [EIP-1559-style mechanism](https://np.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/o4unlp/ama_we_are_the_efs_research_team_pt_6_23_june_2021/h2rjidm/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=web2x&context=3). Data costs will thus be effectively decoupled from execution, becoming significantly cheaper once data shards are live. While data shards will be primarily intended for use by rollups, L1 smart contracts may too get creative and find ways to use them.

\- Following from the above two comments, data availability sampling will follow less than 12 months after shards are first deployed. It won't require a hard fork, and can be implemented incrementally.

\- The transition to [post-quantum cryptography is non-negotiable](https://np.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/o4unlp/ama_we_are_the_efs_research_team_pt_6_23_june_2021/h2rhmnn/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=web2x&context=3). Fascinating comment by Justin here!

\- If zk Rollups prove zkVMs work as intended, [execution shards become essentially moot](https://np.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/o4unlp/ama_we_are_the_efs_research_team_pt_6_23_june_2021/h2rl0p6/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=web2x&context=3). The better option then becomes to zk-SNARK the EVM at L1. There's a real chance execution shards never happens, and at this time is only a back up option if zkVMs don't work out.

\- In what is surely my favourite comment of the day, Carl Beek thinks his colleague's (Justin's) [ultra sound money meme is silly](https://np.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/o4unlp/ama_we_are_the_efs_research_team_pt_6_23_june_2021/h2ridsb/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) and we should be focusing on ETH's value being tied to its usefulness instead. However, he acknowledges that Bitcoin deriving most of its value from memes means he may be wrong.

\- [Sharding and statelessness are being developed in parallel](https://np.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/o4unlp/ama_we_are_the_efs_research_team_pt_6_23_june_2021/h2rh565/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=web2x&context=3), and [it's unclear which comes first](https://np.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/o4unlp/ama_we_are_the_efs_research_team_pt_6_23_june_2021/h2rvsdn/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=web2x&context=3).

\- [Terrific comment about Vitalik's process](https://np.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/o4unlp/ama_we_are_the_efs_research_team_pt_6_23_june_2021/h2rh86y/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=web2x&context=3).

\- Difference between decentralized staking pools and dPoS-style chains highlighed by [Vitalik](https://np.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/o4unlp/ama_we_are_the_efs_research_team_pt_6_23_june_2021/h2rqfwb/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) and [Dankrad](https://np.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/o4unlp/ama_we_are_the_efs_research_team_pt_6_23_june_2021/h2rvm64/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=web2x&context=3). I'll add that delegated-type chains could potentially be viable at home. One example is Cardano, currently with its 7 TPS / 65kB block limit it's actually easier to run than Ethereum. But of course, not for long, these chains very quickly tend to bump up their limits as without higher scalability they're kind of pointless.

\- Very important point by Dankrad - [rollups will maintain composability across multiple data shards](https://np.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/o4unlp/ama_we_are_the_efs_research_team_pt_6_23_june_2021/h2rv0iw/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=web2x&context=3). So you could theoretically have one mega-rollup doing 100,000 TPS. Of course, composability between rollups is a harder problem, and we'll likely have [asychronous solutions](https://np.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/o4unlp/ama_we_are_the_efs_research_team_pt_6_23_june_2021/h2rifw6/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=web2x&context=3), though they should be manageable. I'll add that zkVMs can have Volition-type architectures where they can have multiple sources of data availability, all while retaining full composability.

\- Clients that are live are not subject to long range attacks, but [some brainstorming on how they can be mitigated](https://np.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/o4unlp/ama_we_are_the_efs_research_team_pt_6_23_june_2021/h2rlppz/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) long term.

\- [Shards are speculatively still expected ""in 2022""](https://np.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/o4unlp/ama_we_are_the_efs_research_team_pt_6_23_june_2021/h2rio79/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=web2x&context=3). I'd say late 2022 is the most likely timeline.

\- [No bombs post-Merge](https://np.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/o4unlp/ama_we_are_the_efs_research_team_pt_6_23_june_2021/h2riu2s/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=web2x&context=3).

\- Finally, there are multiple comments about The Merge. I'll summarize it as the following: no research obstacles left, there's a complete spec, all that's remaining is engineering and testing. Q1 2022 seems the most likely timeline.

As a bonus:

\- This bit is not actually something from the AMA, just my own estimations, but thought it would be interesting. [I'm extrapolating from the clarifications here](https://np.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/o4unlp/ama_we_are_the_efs_research_team_pt_6_23_june_2021/h2rhceg/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=web2x&context=3). The numbers are much clearer to me now, so I can finally do some calculations myself. In an ideal scenario where all activity was on rollups, all transactions were simple [ETH transfers consuming 12 bytes](https://vitalik.ca/general/2021/01/05/rollup.html), and fixed costs became negligible, the current execution chain could handle upto 6,500 TPS for rollups. This could be higher still on zk Rollups with signature aggregation. For ERC-20 transfers and 16 byte transactions, this would be about 4,800 TPS. Note that these numbers are post-Merge when block times are exactly 12 seconds; in a PoW world they are 10% lower with 13+ second block times. Of course, much lower for complex DeFi transactions. We've seen on Ethereum mainnet how the mix of transactions skews towards simpler transactions while the gas price is high, with more complex transactions while the gas price is low. Similarly, I'd expect an explosion of activity on rollups for complex DeFi, prediction markets, privacy etc. transactions as many of these have priced out many people thus far. So, I'd anticipate somewhere between 1,000 TPS to 1,500 TPS on average for rollups. When data sharding releases, this will be accelerated by a further 18x, which is upto 118,000 TPS, or 25,000 TPS including complex transactions. However, note that in the comment Vitalik acknowledges the data sharding rollout may possibly begin with lower data availability if it's deemed to be lower risk, and then systematically expand. Over the decades, if the maximum of 1,024 data shards are enabled, this would be 400,000 to 1.8 million TPS for rollups.

\- But wait, it doesn't end there, as that doesn't account for technological progress, so data per shard can also expand! Back to the AMA, [how about 7.3M TPS](https://np.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/o4unlp/ama_we_are_the_efs_research_team_pt_6_23_june_2021/h2rjhjp/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) in a decade before even accounting for more shards? Multiply that by the maximum number of shards, and we're approaching 100 million TPS. (Of course, these are speculative extrapolations and things like storage may not keep up with bandwidth, so please don't take them seriously, but fun anyway!)",40.0,2021-06-25 05:09:24,0.86

\- The transition to [post-quantum cryptography is non-negotiable](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/o4unlp/ama_we_are_the_efs_research_team_pt_6_23_june_2021/h2rhmnn/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=web2x&context=3). Fascinating comment by Justin here!

\- If zk Rollups prove zkVMs work as intended, [execution shards become essentially moot](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/o4unlp/ama_we_are_the_efs_research_team_pt_6_23_june_2021/h2rl0p6/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=web2x&context=3). The better option then becomes to zk-SNARK the EVM at L1. There's a real chance execution shards never happens, and at this time is only a back up option if zkVMs don't work out.

\- In what is surely my favourite comment of the day, Carl Beek thinks his colleague's (Justin's) [ultra sound money meme is silly](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/o4unlp/ama_we_are_the_efs_research_team_pt_6_23_june_2021/h2ridsb/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) and we should be focusing on ETH's value being tied to its usefulness instead. However, he acknowledges that Bitcoin deriving most of its value from memes means he may be wrong.

\- [Sharding and statelessness are being developed in parallel](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/o4unlp/ama_we_are_the_efs_research_team_pt_6_23_june_2021/h2rh565/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=web2x&context=3), and [it's unclear which comes first](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/o4unlp/ama_we_are_the_efs_research_team_pt_6_23_june_2021/h2rvsdn/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=web2x&context=3).

\- [Terrific comment about Vitalik's process](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/o4unlp/ama_we_are_the_efs_research_team_pt_6_23_june_2021/h2rh86y/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=web2x&context=3).

\- Difference between decentralized staking pools and dPoS-style chains highlighed by [Vitalik](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/o4unlp/ama_we_are_the_efs_research_team_pt_6_23_june_2021/h2rqfwb/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) and [Dankrad](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/o4unlp/ama_we_are_the_efs_research_team_pt_6_23_june_2021/h2rvm64/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=web2x&context=3). I'll add that delegated-type chains could potentially be viable at home. One example is Cardano, currently with its 7 TPS / 65kB block limit it's actually easier to run than Ethereum. But of course, not for long, these chains very quickly tend to bump up their limits as without higher scalability they're kind of pointless.

\- Very important point by Dankrad - [rollups will maintain composability across multiple data shards](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/o4unlp/ama_we_are_the_efs_research_team_pt_6_23_june_2021/h2rv0iw/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=web2x&context=3). So you could theoretically have one mega-rollup doing 100,000 TPS. Of course, composability between rollups is a harder problem, and we'll likely have [asychronous solutions](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/o4unlp/ama_we_are_the_efs_research_team_pt_6_23_june_2021/h2rifw6/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=web2x&context=3), though they should be manageable. I'll add that zkVMs can have Volition-type architectures where they can have multiple sources of data availability, all while retaining full composability.

\- Clients that are live are not subject to long range attacks, but [some brainstorming on how they can be mitigated](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/o4unlp/ama_we_are_the_efs_research_team_pt_6_23_june_2021/h2rlppz/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) long term.

\- [Shards are speculatively still expected ""in 2022""](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/o4unlp/ama_we_are_the_efs_research_team_pt_6_23_june_2021/h2rio79/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=web2x&context=3). I'd say late 2022 is the most likely timeline.

\- [No bombs post-Merge](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/o4unlp/ama_we_are_the_efs_research_team_pt_6_23_june_2021/h2riu2s/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=web2x&context=3).

\- Finally, there are multiple comments about The Merge. I'll summarize it as the following: no research obstacles left, there's a complete spec, all that's remaining is engineering and testing. Q1 2022 seems the most likely timeline.

As a bonus:

\- This bit is not actually something from the AMA, just my own estimations, but thought it would be interesting. [I'm extrapolating from the clarifications here](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/o4unlp/ama_we_are_the_efs_research_team_pt_6_23_june_2021/h2rhceg/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=web2x&context=3). The numbers are much clearer to me now, so I can finally do some calculations myself. In an ideal scenario where all activity was on rollups, all transactions were simple token transfers, and fixed costs became negligible, the current execution chain could handle upto 4,800 TPS for rollups. This could be higher still on zk Rollups with signature aggregation. Note that these numbers are post-Merge when block times are exactly 12 seconds; in a PoW world they are 10% lower with 13+ second block times. Of course, much lower for complex DeFi transactions. We've seen on Ethereum mainnet how the mix of transactions skews towards simpler transactions while the gas price is high, with more complex transactions while the gas price is low. Similarly, I'd expect an explosion of activity on rollups for complex DeFi, prediction markets, privacy etc. transactions as many of these have priced out many people thus far. So, I'd anticipate somewhere between 1,000 TPS to 1,500 TPS on average for rollups. When data sharding releases, this will be accelerated by a further 18x, which is upto 85,000 TPS, or 25,000 TPS including complex transactions. However, note that in the comment Vitalik acknowledges the data sharding rollout may possibly begin with lower data availability if it's deemed to be lower risk, and then systematically expand. Over the decades, if the maximum of 1,024 data shards are enabled, this would be 400,000 to 1.3 million TPS for rollups. (Erratum: I have made some corrections to this section, I had previously estimated 6,500 TPS for even simpler transactions, but very likely 16-byte transactions are the simplest we'll get.) 

\- But wait, it doesn't end there, as that doesn't account for technological progress, so data per shard can also expand! Back to the AMA, [how about 7.3M TPS](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/o4unlp/ama_we_are_the_efs_research_team_pt_6_23_june_2021/h2rjhjp/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) in a decade before even accounting for more shards? Multiply that by the maximum number of shards, and we're approaching 100 million TPS. (Of course, these are speculative extrapolations and things like storage may not keep up with bandwidth, so please don't take them seriously, but fun anyway!)

Ethosphere Timeline update for 21st June - Not all bad. Protocol upgrade dates firming up. Good things still happening. Trust!,"What's up r/ethfinance. Let’s take a moment to avert our gaze, just for a little bit, from the challenging price action and remind ourselves that the overall development plan for the ecosystem is making solid progress and Hawaii 2022 is [definitely a thing](https://hodler.holiday/)! Although perhaps we'll all be too rekt to enjoy it?

In super positive news, the major Ethereum protocol updates - London, Altair and The Merge - are all still on track. London and Altair have additional meat around the bones re: testnet dates. London’s are [now firmed up](https://blog.ethereum.org/2021/06/18/london-testnets-announcement/). This week (!) London goes up on Ropsten, with Goerli and Rinkeby to follow each a week apart. **28 July is definitely still in play for the London mainnet date.** Check out 1559 fee burn on the Calaveras devnet [here](http://watchtheburn.com/) and [Cat Herders 1559 pre-launch Q&A](https://youtu.be/AC1FS3LmoT4) with Tim Beiko and the team. For Altair, [solid engineering progress has been made](https://hackmd.io/@benjaminion/SJoLSp_s_) by the consensus layer client teams, and an early August release date is looking more certain. Altair testnet dates soon to be agreed on 1st July Eth2 Implementers call. 

Not too much news on The Merge this week as all dev team focus is on London and Altair. Variety of date estimates on The Merge right now. Some of the more credible ones:

~ Nethermind - [October 2021](https://twitter.com/nethermindeth/status/1385699335355125766)

~ Prysm - [late 2021](https://newsletter.thedefiant.io/p/ethereum-is-about-six-months-away-4b0)

~ Besu - [December](https://consensys.net/blog/blockchain-explained/charting-the-path-to-proof-of-stake-ethereum/)

~ Teku - [Q1 2022](https://hackmd.io/@benjaminion/eth2_news/https%3A%2F%2Fhackmd.io%2F%40benjaminion%2Fwnie2_210522#The-Merge)

~ Vitalik - [early Q1](https://youtu.be/XW0QZmtbjvs?t=5691)

Looking beyond The Merge, the Sharding spec [is iteratively improving](https://twitter.com/protolambda/status/1405711431786434560).

Vitalik also has a proposal out for [state expiry and statelessness](https://notes.ethereum.org/@vbuterin/verkle_and_state_expiry_proposal), to occur over the course of two separate upgrades. These changes will improve scaleability by [reducing the size requirements](https://hackmd.io/@vbuterin/state_size_management) for running Ethereum nodes. We’ll need to wait and see if the ideas gain traction (let’s be real, they likely will) over the coming months before assignment to any particular hard forks.

Other things

~ Competition in the ZK-rollups space is heating up with the impending mainnet launches for both zkSync and [Starkware](https://medium.com/starkware/starknet-planets-alpha-on-ropsten-e7494929cb95) edging closer (see table below).

~ No update on how close Arbitrum or Optimism are to the same but Arbitrum in particular [are announcing](https://twitter.com/arbitrum) new partner on-boardings at pace right now. Although, not to be outdone, at least Optimism has [The Graph lined up for launch](https://twitter.com/graphprotocol/status/1405929132932878339?s=20)!

Some of you are so bummed about the price. Can I just point out some things that make me excited about ETH still?,"1. First off, EIP-1559 is just over four weeks away. It will establish a new paradigm in making a cryptocurrency deflationary, and it will get the corresponding media attention.
2. Apps are absolutely booming on Ethereum. Spicy and new are almost-gas-free platforms, called Layer 2s. [The number of projects is simply amazing.](https://medium.com/coinmonks/the-layer-2-wars-heat-up-b8d02d3dd332)
3. While BTC will continue being criticized for being environmentally unfriendly, ETH will soon fix this. That is, the merge is still planned for late '21 / early '22, making the whole blockchain based on Proof of Stake.
4. The number of developers on Ethereum, and their talent, is amazing. Almost any project is hiring right now, just check their Twitter calls for developers. The current projects are stunning and smooth, so just image what lies ahead of us. Also, Ethereum is the only place where DAOs have really gotten of the ground, and I am sure they will be influential.
5. All in all, prices are holding well. There's a lot of bad press now, BTC takes a lot of flak, etc. And still, we seem relatively stable around 2500 usd. Looking at historic charts, that definitely leaves room for a move upwards.

The more I learn about the ecosystem, the more it inspires me. We are seeing a futuristic development for finance, right under our noses.

Sure, the red lines hurt, here too. But for all the above reasons and more, I am simply excited about Ethereum's future. The price can fluctuate, but the tech will keep on growing.",38.0,2021-06-20 20:22:53,0.96

No, Vitalik did not ""delay"" the merge to POS. No, it isn't going to happen end of 2022. No, the fake article that you might have read proclaiming the supposed delay was based on a comment that was taken out of context. That said, there is a possibility that the merge is pushed into early 2022, but the plan is still for it to happen in December, 2021.

Rocket Pool has changed its tokenomics... again.,"So today the Rocket Pool developers dropped the article that they promised last week. This article was primarily focused on providing an update concerning the 0x02 issues. Not much news concerning this: there is still no consensus yet but they are preparing a strong case in order to present it to the ETH 2.0 devs, this is a good thing.

With regards to the launch, we're looking at somewhere end of July optimistically. As expected, the 0x02 issues and reaudits took up a lot of time from the developers, which has now manifested into an unsurprising delay (versus launch consensus end of June). Goal is to launch the Prater testnet where they will battletest the protocol for four weeks, after which they will launch on mainnet. Better safe than sorry!

However, something rather important was also mentioned in the article, and I've noticed that this hasn't really been picked up on by the community. The excerpt concerning this is as follows:

>For Rocket Pool, we help ensure validators are protected against penalties/slashing events by staking a min 10% RPL (in ETH value) on their node as an insurance promise to the protocol. They are rewarded for this from the protocol in new RPL. However we also allowed these stakers to withdraw staked RPL as well which created a few issues around unpredictable rewards amounts for node operators and potential gaming were node operators who were going to be slashed, withdrew before the event occurred. We’ve since amended this so that node operators **can only withdraw excess RPL above the max 150%** allowed to prevent these issues.

This is actually a major deal as it **changes the way in how the tokenomics work**. Before I can provide you with an impact study, I first want to elaborate on the reward structure for a Rocket Pool node operator (NO).

The total reward distribution consists out of three parts:

1. The ETH staking APY, currently around 7% (rewarded in ETH)
2. The commission rate for running a node (rETH holders pay this to NO's) (rewarded in ETH)
3. The RPL rewards distributed to NO's via the minting of RPL (first year 70% of the minted RPL was going to go to NO's) (rewarded in RPL)

The RPL reward distribution, estimated to be the most valuable part of the three, is distributed based on the amount of RPL that a NO has deposited into his node relative to the average amount of RPL that NO's have distributed into their node across the network. Basically, the more RPL you deposit, the bigger the slice of the minted RPL.

The goal is to incentivize NO's to deposit a lot of RPL, as the RPL will be used to insure the pool against slashing.

Based on this mechanic, various investors made wild predictions that due to the ability to farm these rewards, the RPL/ETH would strongly appreciate, given that many NO's were going to overcollaterize their nodes to 150%. To do so, they need to buy RPL.

In their view, this created a sort of positive feedback loop, where chasing the RPL rewards led to an increase in demand for RPL, which in turn led to an increase in the RPL/ETH price which finally led to the rewards becoming more valuable. This logic culminated into the infamous ""Rocket Pool Investment Thesis"" dropped on /r/ethfinance a few months ago.

TL;DR: moon.

However, under the **new tokenomics, which does not allow the withdrawal of deposited RPL**, the system has been altered completely.

I see roughly three major issues at play that threaten not only node operators but also the security of the Ethereum network:

*1) Inability to withdraw due to RPL/ETH price fluctuations:*

Previously, NO's were able to rebalance their RPL in a rather flexible way. If their collaterization rate dropped under 10%, they had to add RPL. If their collaterization rate went above 10%, they could withdraw RPL. Under the new system, the ability to withdraw RPL is no longer possible. This essentially means that if the RPL/ETH price **were to drop**, the collaterization rate of your node might drop below 10%, which in turn forces you to add additional RPL to your node. Theoretically, this could go on until the RPL/ETH price is 0.

However, if the RPL/ETH price increases, your collaterization rate would also increase, but still you wouldn't be able to withdraw the excess RPL. This is bizarre to me: you must keep depositing to avoid getting punished, but if you have more than required, you can't take it back.

*2) Centralization of nodes among whales*

As stated above, the primary driver of the reward distribution stems from the RPL rewards. With regards to the distribution, nothing has changed. However, many mid-sized players with 16 ETH planned to collaterize their node quite heavily to farm these rewards. Many of these people were not super wealthy, but had a decent size of their net worth into crypto and were willing to take that risk. After all, they could always withdraw their deposited RPL, right? Not anymore. Due to this additional lock-up mechanic, the risk has increased substiantially. If you were to overcollaterize your node up to 150% at current prices, you would have to deposit in excess of 5000 RPL at current prices. Adding this to your ETH deposit of 16 ETH, you are locking up roughly 90k USD (again, at current prices). That 60k is money that is **locked up.** Locked up until the merge, and even after the merge, not withdrawable in an instant, flexible way.

For many individuals, this approach is no longer viable as price fluctuations can greatly impact your return. Many in the Rocket Pool Discord have already mentioned that they would not be overcollaterizing their node to 150%. As a result, the demand for RPL/ETH will not be as big as previously anticipated, given that fewer will overcollaterize. This plays into the hands of major, liquid whales with plenty of money to spare who can safely undertake such risk in their capital allocation scheme.

These players **do have the funds available** to overcollaterize their node to 150% and thus farm the resulting RPL rewards. Given how the math works, they will gain much more rewards than smaller NO's who can only put up 10%. As a consequence, running a node as a regular individual becomes much less attractive, given that the RPL rewards will mostly go to whales.

*3) Underperforming solo stakers as a NO due to RPL/ETH price risk*

Thirdly, there is the RPL/ETH price risk that will affect NO's. Based on bullet points 1 and 2, the RPL/ETH demand will not be as large as before. In fact, the inability to withdraw could be considered as a serious downside, even if you're only putting up 10% of your node as a collateral (1.6 ETH). I'll show you an example why:

Let's assume a scenario where a NO has collaterized his node with 10%. This means putting up RPL worth 1.6 ETH. At current prices, this is around 350 RPL. This is not withdrawable. Now, what happens if the RPL/ETH price drops? The RPL that the NO has deposited into his pool suddenly becomes less valuable in ETH.

Because the minimum collaterization rate is always 10% aka 1.6 ETH, the NO must deposit **additional RPL** into his node because his 350 RPL will no longer be worth 1.6 ETH. Again, this deposited RPL is not withdrawable. What if the price crashes even further? Then the NO will be forced to constantly add RPL to his node so that he meets the 10% collaterization rate. At some point in time, a point will be reached where the additional commission rewards from running a node + the already downsized RPL rewards will no longer be enough to outperform a solo staker!

This is clear to see: given that you're putting up 17.6 ETH (of which 1.6 ETH in RPL); if the price of RPL/ETH would tank, the RPL component of your capital will become less valuable, which loses you money. On top of that, you have to **keep adding RPL** to the already burning fire!

This is opposed to running a solo node, where you deposit 32 ETH and get the ETH APY without additional price risk!

In my view, the chances of the scenario described above have increased, given the decrease in demand for RPL that this will entail, affecting the RPL/ETH ratio. In fact, combining all three bullet points should give you a clear indication as to why the bull thesis for RPL/ETH isn't really there anymore.

Price-wise, based on these findings, I expect two things to occur in the short to long-term:

1. Mid-sized players start dumping RPL because (a) no more plans to overcollaterize thus no longer necessary or (b) tokenomics have changed aka investment thesis has changed
2. The network will be more secure given how the insurance is now fixed rather than flexible. In the long-term, the RPL/ETH price will consistently decline when the demand for staking stops due to saturation, while ETH keeps growing in value as it takes over the financial world. This is actually a good thing, as it keeps entry barriers low. It's not a good thing for people wanting to pump their bags though.

Overall, I'm not very happy about this. While the withdrawal lock-up will make the protocol more secure and resistent, the hunt for the RPL rewards will draw in major whales, which in turn will lead to centralisation.

Given that Rocket Pool is one of the only decentralised, non-custodial staking pools being built, this may impact the security of the Beacon chain.

Lastly, the change in tokenomics is bad news for bagholders. Short-term pumps of the ratio seems to be out of the question due to a lower demand, and a prolonged downtrend seems likely, as players who invested into the token based on previous tokenomics information start to sell now that fundamentals have altered.

That's it from my end. Curious to see what the community thinks of this.

As always, yours truly,

/u/stevewonderburg aka ""Steve the Reddit Guy""

TL;DR change in tokenomics at Rocket Pool means you cannot withdraw your deposited RPL anymore. This disincentivizes individuals to run a node as opposed to previously due to price risk, resulting in a situation where most NO's are large whales. This will lead to centralisation. Negative impact on RPL/ETH ratio likely as major players start selling based on this news.",93.0,2021-06-15 17:52:42,0.79
Last week in Rocketpool - June 2nd - June 8th,"# Last week in RocketPool - June 2nd - June 8th

**Roadmap**

* Both Sigma Prime and Consensys Audit have returned their second round reports last week.
* The team is closing down the [http://beta.rocketpool.net/](http://beta.rocketpool.net/) website. Preparations for the Prater testnet are under development and a potential launch date for this testnet will be announced shortly.
   * Important to note is that this is not an extra beta, and no rewards will be given out for participants. This testnet is meant for new node operators who want to try out RocketPool before jumping onto mainnet.
* The team intends to give a general update this week regarding the state of RocketPool and what their plans are going forward. (E.g. Prater testnet, state of 0x02, audits post mortem, ...)

**Priorities**

* Langers
   * Is working together with Flashbots to see how MEV can be extracted in a decentralised manner for RocketPool. Once things have progressed, there will be a public channel on the RocketPool or Flashbots discord where the community can ask questions or get information.
   * Was preparing/defending the case for 0x02.
   * Identified the issue that was causing some people to miss out on the beta bucket 3 rewards. Missing RPL rewards have now been sent out to affected participants.
   * Observability: defining a network health dashboard and mapping contract events that should be capturing for diagnostics
* Jcrtp
   * Has been updating the docs.
   * Has been preparing and defending the case for 0x02.
   * Has been working on RC3 for the smart node stack.
* Kane
   * Working on the Sigma Prime and Consensys second round feedback
      * There are some big improvements in terms of gas cost that Kane is implementing based on the last feedback. (E.g. 250k gas -> 148k gas. Other examples are more, some are less)
      * Check the RocketPool smart contract repo on Github this week to see the bulk of these changes.
* Nick
   * Adding node withdrawal address update support to the website/UI
   * Developing the RPLv1 to RPLv2 migration page on the website/UI
* Dave
   * Development update article covering audit and 0x02 topics
   * Code reviews
   * Biz dev

***Governance***

* The 0x02 proposal ([https://github.com/ethereum/eth2.0-specs/pull/2454](https://github.com/ethereum/eth2.0-specs/pull/2454)) was brought forward on the ETH2 call on the 3rd of June. Since then, it has been discussed in the ETH R&D discord. (see ‘Withdrawal Credentials’) The main arguments are:
   * Decentralized pools will be at a disadvantage if this proposal isn’t implemented because not all actors can be guaranteed an equal share of the rewards, more specifically the inclusion fees.
   * Node operators who are solo staking or who are part of a decentralized protocol could be the target of an attack because the 'coinbase' address (set by a validator when proposing a block) can be changed without the node operator potentially knowing about it, causing him/her to miss out on revenue from the inclusion fees. These node operators are more likely to be the target of this attack because they have less means to defend them in comparison to a central entity with greater capital.
* The team recognizes the importance of this issue & are working on it, but their main focus is on the Prater testnet launch and road to mainnet. It is too early to tell whether this discussion will have any significant impact on the upcoming launch, but the devs think we have a strong case for 0x02 to be accepted. Also, multiple members on the ETH R&D discord (Micah and Lakhsman) have said that the security aspect for solo stakers is compelling.
* There are a few ways it could play out:
   * If it is decided that this proposal should be implemented as part of 0x01, we don’t have to change anything and no re-audits are needed. Everything stays as-is.
   * If a promise is made to implement 0x02 in the merge OR in a later hardfork, there is only 1 line of code that needs to be changed for RocketPool to be 0x02 compatible. No re-audits are necessary in this case.
   * If 0x02 is not accepted, the team has identified a number of possible solutions that they can implement. Not all of the solutions require immediate changes and some are bigger than others. If no immediate changes are needed, no re-audits are needed.",94.0,2021-06-08 06:06:33,0.99
Ethereum's rollup-centric roadmap is unique,"It feels like many seem to have missed that Ethereum has fully pivoted towards a rollup-centric roadmap. The idea for a rollup-centric Ethereum originates to April 2019 with [""Phase One and Done"" post by cdetrio](https://ethresear.ch/t/phase-one-and-done-eth2-as-a-data-availability-engine/5269). It was cemented in October 2020 by Vitalik's [A rollup-centric ethereum roadmap](https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/a-rollup-centric-ethereum-roadmap/4698). Since then, a lot of development by the broad Ethereum ecosystem has revolved around rollups. I'll try to be as succinct as possible, so forgive me for oversimplifying things.

In a nutshell, Ethereum's goal with the rollup-centric roadmap is to:

\- Be the best consensus layer (Being achieved through the transition to proof-of-stake)

\- Be the best data availability layer (Being achieved by data sharding, which comes after The Merge)

\- Let rollups be the best execution layers

\- L1 will be the settlement layer for rollups, institutions, and financial service providers; almost all consumer activity will be on L2. Make L1 the best execution layer for rollup settlement.

Previously, Ethereum's goal (with the old Ethereum 2.0 roadmap) was to do it all, with scalability focused on L1. However, since then, we have had a cambrian explosion in rollup tech - especially ZK proofs. A rollup-centric Ethereum is a more pragmatic option now, because:

\- It offers much greater scalability than L1 ever could with sharding (at least 25x more)

\- It'll offer that sooner with less complexity and security risks

\- It'll enable flexibility and rapid innovation on the execution layers / VMs not possible with L1s

The result is we're heading into a multi-L2 world, with significantly greater scalability 20x beyond anything imagined by the old L1-centric Ethereum 2.0 roadmap, and much sooner. The great challenges remaining are L2 <> L2, L1 <> L2 interoperability, ecosystem UX improvements, wallet/exchange support - but all of these are being worked on to enable this new paradigm. Of course, rollups themselves will also take time to mature - many will be [running with training wheels](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/nl9cum/early_rollup_training_wheels/). Eventually, we'll have an ecosystem where all your favourite dApps are on L2s, L2s seamlessly interoperate with each other, all wallets support all L2s and seamlessly switch between them as required, CEXs deposit/withdraw directly to/from L2s, and most consumers will never interact with L1. But there's a lot of work to do to get here, and it'll take a couple of years for things to mature. There's certainly a risk that none of these will work, but I think there's enough evidence from both currently operating rollups and alternate L1s (i.e. the multi-chain world) that it will work.

It is important to note that L1 gas prices will remain high for the foreseeable future, but it wouldn't matter because everyone would be paying much cheaper fees on L2. Eventually, we could turn on execution on L1 shards, but it's unclear if this will even be required once the rollup-centric Ethereum ecosystem matures. Interestingly, whatever innovations rollups bring can eventually make its way back to L1. I can see this situation play out: Over the next few years, ZK rollups become the standard, and certain variants of ZK rollups will prove to be the most robust and efficient. Ethereum L1 can then follow this concept and upgrade L1 to be ZKed. On a shorter time frame, L2s have a more urgent need for state management techniques like statelessness/state expiry and will very likely implement these before L1, and can directly inform L1's implementations.

A word on ""competitors"". Most chains like Solana, BS Chain and Cardano are still trying to do it all with a single ledger and a compromised consensus mechanism. At this point, rollups like Arbitrum are direct competitors to these chains, not Ethereum, sans the compromises. Indeed, I'd recommend most of these L1s to abandon their consensus mechanism and become a rollup. Some have chosen a multi-chain approach, like Cosmos or Avalanche, where multiple chains can be built on top of single consensus layer. This is closer to a multi-L2 approach, but of course, this trades off security as an already limited validator set are divided into subnets. Sharded chains like Polkadot and NEAR bypass this issue. The closest to a rollup-centric Ethereum is Polkadot. Like rollups, Polkadot shards (parachains) can run different VMs but share a common consensus mechanism. Where Polkadot diverges from Ethereum are parachains have significant limitations over rollups: a) they are permissioned (clarification: you need to participate in and win an auction, with rollups you can deploy as many as you want at any time. However, parathreads can offer similar functionality.), b) still mandate permanent state by collators, and c) are restricted to fraud proofs and other standards. Rollups open up the design space for execution layers significantly in a decentralized and permissionless manner. (No, I didn't forget about Polygon, but that's for another post)

Finally, going back to the initial points - no other chain is even attempting to compete with the scale of Ethereum's consensus layer (\~1 million validators) and data layer (64 data shards, \~1.4 MB/s, more can be added over time) - which makes Ethereum a unique proposition in this space with no real competition.",205.0,2021-05-31 08:46:07,0.99
Eth 2.0 and why matic will still thrive,"Seen a good post explaining the above why and i always see people ask why will matic be needed ect so im copy pasting something that explains it quite well.

Pasting this here:

 I've seen  a little bit of this commentary recently, so i'll try to address it in a single post for clarity. Please pay it forward by educating others when you can.

Mostly it refers to the question of ""Does Ethereum launching EIP-1559/Improving their scaling/the launch of Optimism compromise the goals of Polygon?"". Mostly the question is driven by the fear of - am I in the right spot with my investment. I won't answer that question (diversify, invest in what you use, use what you invest in, sell the top!), but I will address the first with a few points:


1.	⁠What is Ethereum 2.0? Despite conjecture, the Eth2 roadmap is already significantly complete. The beacon chain has been launched (http://beaconcha.in) since December. The next milestones remain to complete ""The Merge"" of both chains into a single Proof of Stake instance, and then to complete Data Sharding later. There's a lot more complex research to it, but that's the most important. These milestones improve the utillity of the base Layer (see more later), but don't increase TPS by any orders of magnitude. The complicated computational sharding that people continue to refer to as ""Ethereum 2.0"" is not happening. This is a good thing, it was always a difficult endeavour and priorities change. So how does Ethereum scale without computational sharding?
2.	⁠Polygon is Ethereum 2.0 - Alongside Loopring, Optimism, ZkSnarks, ImmutableX etc, Layer 2 is the future architecture of Ethereum. You can read more here: https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/a-rollup-centric-ethereum-roadmap/4698 Ultimately, we are going to need all of these experiments and maybe more, and hopefully multiple technologies become viable and provide separate cost/time/security trade-offs for different dApps. For example, ImmutableX is laser focused on gaming NFTs. The only difference is that Polygon is taking a multi-technology approach, rather than a narrow single technology approach. This is ambitous, but they intend to offer all of these options under a single umbrella. As we move to an inter-chain world, this will hopefully pay off in terms of User Experience. But they will need to work closely with other teams to get this done, and that is what they're doing.
3.	⁠EIP-1559 supports this vision - in this world, we need a reliable Layer 1, where roll-ups and sidechains that Polygon deploy can be consistenly and regularly checkpointed to the base chain. Gas will likely remain high on Ethereum due to roll-up demand, so EIP-1559 and Data Sharding are important projects to supercharge the base layer. While they won't give it magical scaling powers to reduce gas to zero, they will make it much more functional in a multi-roll-up world.
4.	⁠Demand vs Supply - This is the classic, nobody goes there it's too crowded scenario. While it might feel like these projects are competing to provide supply, the correct way to think about it is that they are working together to ensure demand. And right now demand is far outstripping supply. While this causes the chaos of high gas, it's super healthy for the network and smart people are working very hard to build into it and overcome it. It could get messy with liquidity mining and incentive wars to bring dApps and developers into each L2 stack, but ultimately - the goal is to scale Ethereum so that people continue to want to use it - and that goal is synergistic.
5.	⁠A multi-chain future - So yes, we're going to have multiple competing technologies, but we'll likely have teams working together, mergers and lots of fun to come, but the Polygon vision to combine these all under one roof makes them both a unique and an exciting prospect and an important part of the Ethereum community. Hopefully we can avoid as much bitterness and uncertainty as possible (and there will be others trying to stoke this doubt), so it's important we keep these values in mind and build towards a harmonious multi-chain future.

I hope that helps! :)",193.0,2021-05-30 11:22:43,0.97

* **Staked Ethereum** reached 3.6 million ETH in Q1 2021. Staking was launched in December 2020.

**Ecosystem Results**

* **Decentralized exchange (DEX) volume** increased 76x to $177 billion in Q1 2021, compared with $2.3 billion in Q1 2020.
* **Decentralized Finance (DeFi) total value locked** increased 64x to 52 billion in Q1 2021, compared with $0.8 billion in Q1 2020.
* **Stablecoin value on Ethereum** increased 5x to $41.9 billion at quarter end Q1 2021, compared with $7.1 billion at quarter end Q1 2020.
* **Wrapped BTC volume** increased 95x to 170k BTC in Q1 2021, compared with 1.8k BTC in Q1 2020. Approximately 1% of bitcoin supply is wrapped as ERC-20 tokens and traded on top of Ethereum.
* **NFT art sales** increased 560x to $396 million in Q1 2021, compared with $0.7 million in Q1 2020.

Ethereum’s strong Q1 growth was not without pains. Gas prices spiked in Q1 due to the incredible popularity of DeFi and NFT applications. Level 2 scaling, which is already being deployed across the ecosystem, aims to alleviate congestion and bring cost and power consumption down to near zero.

**Ethereum Ecosystem Highlights**

* **Metamask**—the popular Ethereum wallet for desktop and mobile—reached 4 million monthly active users (MAUs) in Q1 and crossed 5 million MAUs in April. Metamask mobile saw strong global growth, especially in India, Indonesia, Vietnam, and Nigeria. Metamask’s MAUs is now comparable to mainstream consumer applications such as Robinhood and Clubhouse.
* **Visa** announced that it now settles payments in the USDC stablecoin on the Ethereum blockchain. This makes Visa the first major payments network to use stablecoin as a settlement currency.
* **Meitu**—a Chinese mobile software company—bought 16,000 ETH for its balance sheet. Meitu’s board has allocated up to $100 million for the purchase of cryptocurrencies to diversify its treasury. Ethereum makes up its largest position. Meitu is also evaluating launching applications on the ethereum blockchain.
* **Canada** approved four ETFs for buying and trading ether. Evolve Ether ETF (TSX: ETHR), CI Galaxy Ethereum ETF (TSX: ETHX), Purpose Ether ETF (TSE: ETHH), and 3iQ CoinShares Ether ETF (TSX:ETHQ) provide easy and cost effective ways to hold ether within a traditional brokerage account.

**Outlook**  
2021 is perhaps the most important year in Ethereum’s history. The two key themes for 2021 are economic security and scalability.

In April the Ethereum core dev team approved EIP1559—a software update that improves the bid process for block space and introduces a burn mechanism for the base portion of the transaction fee. Fee burn will offset a substantial portion of Ethereum issuance, paving the way for long term network security with minimum dilution. EIP1559 is on track to be deployed on test nets on June 9th followed by official rollout via the London hard fork on July 14th.

Ethereum has a dual pronged approach to scaling network capacity—rollups and sharding. Rollups batch and compress transactions off-chain, increasing transaction throughput by \~100x. Sharding breaks the Ethereum main chain into sub-chains to enable parallel computation, further improving throughput by \~100x. By employing both technologies, Ethereum 2.0 at maturity could process upward of 100,000 transactions per second versus 15 today.

In early Q2, Ethereum ecosystem partners launched a number of projects powered by rollups.

dYdX launched its zk-rollup platform for perpetual futures trading while Immutable X launched a zk-rollup based platform for minting and trading NFTs. Transactions via rollups consume negligible energy compared to the main chain, addressing one of the main criticisms of the NFT economy. Uniswap—the most popular decentralized exchange for Ethereum is expected to launch rollups via Optimism in the coming weeks.

Toward the end of the year, Ethereum aims to switch from its current proof of work algorithm to proof of stake. The initial version of the proof of stake chain (“beacon chain”) was released in December 2020. On May 12th developers conducted a successful merge of the two chains in a test environment. Proof of stake will reduce Ethereum’s energy consumption by 99% while providing democratic access to staking rewards for all ETH holders.

**Balance Sheet**  
At the start of Q1 2021, the Ethereum Foundation’s treasury had 460k ether valued at $560 million. At the end of Q1 2021, the treasury’s balance was 430k ether, valued at $826 million. The Ethereum Foundation spent 30k ether during the quarter but the treasury’s value in USD terms grew due to ether-USD appreciation.

The original is here:  [Scalability roadmap cheat sheet : ethereum (reddit.com)](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/nc27d8/scalability_roadmap_cheat_sheet/) so I won't go into details. Just two thoughts though:

\- The 640 shards is obviously unsafe right now, as Vitalik's post argues, but could be a possibility over the decade as SSD costs continue declining. Obviously, it'll happen in steps. I also feel the rollup revolution is inevitable and the most likely outcome for L1 is a subset of shards have execution enabled years down the line, after stateless/expiry, with ZK proofs, while most shards remain focused on data availability.

\- I'd like to know what a ZK-SNARKed L1 looks like! Maybe a future topic for Vitalik's blog?",36.0,2021-05-25 07:06:41,0.97
Merge in 2021? Curb your enthusiasm.,"I'm seeing some conclusions drawn from the difficulty bomb having been delayed to December 1st 2021, such as: ""The merge has to happen before then!""

It's looking increasingly unlikely that it will. Another feature fork - Shanghai - or the merge (\*) have to happen before then. That there is a December 1st 2021 difficulty bomb does not mean that The Merge will happen in November 2021.

(\*) There is no fully defined feature list yet. Devs are still discussing \*what\* goes into the first part of the merge, never mind \*when\*. ""Consensus upgrade"" for sure, but beyond that it gets a little murky.

There was a recent discussion about merge work and timeline in the Ethereum R&D Discord. I'd like to share some takeaways.

There are no deadlines, only planning targets. Adrian Sutton on this:  


\>>

Yeah people think all kinds of crazy things regardless of what we try to tell them. Half the people think the merge is coming far sooner than it can and half think it’s still years away. 

We just need to keep reiterating that there is no central authority and so no guaranteed timelines. Just random people guessing on the internet. Things will ship when they’re ready.

\>>

&#x200B;

I know. You want a timeline. Please keep the above in mind and have this quote from Micah, in reference to merge testnet release weeks after London:  


\>>

I personally think that is unlikely.  How I suspect it will go is something like:

1. London goes out in July.

2. People start working on Shanghai and The Merge in parallel.

3. Shanghai goes out in November.

4. The Merge goes out in Q1 or Q2 2022.

&#x200B;

I think The Merge in October/November incredibly optimistic, even if theoretically possible.  It is likely that one or two clients will be Merge ready before the end of November, but I doubt all 9 clients will be ready by then and I don't see us leaving behind half of the clients.  Maybe if 8 of the 9 clients are ready we would have a conversation about leaving the 9th behind... but not leaving behind 3 or 4.

Ethereum will use an estimated 99.95% less energy post merge,"TLDR: Under PoW, as the price of ETH and the hashrate are positively correlated. Therefore, as as the price increases, in equilibrium so too does the power consumed by the network. Under Proof-of-Stake, when the price of ETH increases, the security of the network does too (the value of the ETH at-stake is worth more), but the energy requirements remain unchanged.

EIP-1559 is now 59 days away! A quick recap on why to be ultra bullish!,"I already wrote a [quick 1-min explainer on EIP-1559 here](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethtrader/comments/myydfi/the_most_exciting_thing_to_happen_to_ethereum/), but let's recap!

When it goes live, and the network is busy (as it often is), a portion of gas fees will be burned. When the network is really busy, this can make ETH deflationary. (Read: decrease the total amount of ETH, so theoretically yours will become worth more.)

Just to counter some common misconceptions: 

* ETH is already paid for fees, so that's nothing new! It's called gas.
* Issuance (2 ETH per block) remains unchanged too.

Later, we will move to Proof of Stake (confirmed for december!). This makes Ethereum energy efficient, reducing usage by 99%. Talk about green!

When the Merge happens, also called ETH2.0, *then* issuance will be changed. Something like 90%! I really like the source: [www.ethmerge.com](https://www.ethmerge.com)

Just a note to newbies: ETH2.0 is just an upgrade to the network. Your ETH will stay ETH, and remains just as useful and valuable! There is **no** ""ETH 2.0 coin"", just ETH as we know it.",189.0,2021-05-17 13:17:48,0.98
DeFi Explained: Sidechains,"One of the biggest drawbacks of decentralized platforms is scalability. For example, Bitcoin and Ethereum are limited in their transactions (per second) compared to centralized payment companies such as VISA. This issue, also called the scalability problem, is a well known challenge for decentralized platforms. Bitcoin, for example, can only handle a maximum of 7 transactions per second. VISA however, can process over 20,000 transactions per second. This is of course a huge difference and if Bitcoin, or crypto as a whole, wants to compete with entities such as VISA, they still have a very long way to go. Fortunately, there are several layer 2 solutions to improve scalability, one of them being sidechains.

# What is a sidechain?

A sidechain is a separate blockchain that is connected to the parent blockchain (main chain) using a two-way link. This means that in addition to the main chain, one or more blockchains exist that are linked to it and can communicate with the main chain. In other words, you can move your cryptocurrencies from the main chain to the sidechain and back again.

The main reason for creating such sidechains is to take most of the work off the main blockchain. For example, the Bitcoin mainchain does all the work that can be done and that's a lot. Hence, only a maximum of 7 tp/s are possible. Moving the lion's share of this work to other blockchains associated with it saves a lot of work on the main chain, freeing up a lot of space. This allows the main chain to focus on what is most important, which is safety in almost all cases. Sidechains can be, for example, specially designed for micropayments.

# How a sidechain works

To be able to use a sidechain, you need to use the main chain. From the main chain you can send a number of the relevant cryptocurrency to a special 'exit address'. The coins will be locked at this address, so you can no longer spend them. Once you have done this, a simple payment verification (SPV) will take place. This confirms on all chains that your cryptocurrency's are no longer on the main chain. It normally takes a while for your coins to be sent to the side chain. This waiting period was set on purpose to make it even more difficult for malicious parties to engage in 'double spending'. After this period, the exact amount of cryptocurrency on the side chain will be released for you to spend.

# The pros and cons of sidechains

The sidechains are great for scaling blockchains. However, everything has its drawbacks. Let’s summarize the pros and cons of sidechains.

## Advantages of side chains

* It ensures that the biggest share of the work is taken off the main chain. This makes the blockchain (much) more scalable.
* Different side branches of a cryptocurrency can arise, each of which has its own specialty.
* It ensures that cryptocurrencies can communicate with each other. They are also perfect for developers to experiment with. For example, before a Beta release is released on the main chain, it can first be tested on a side chain.

## Cons

* The biggest disadvantage of sidechains is that they need to be secured just as well as 'normal' blockchains. This means that it requires miners to keep an eye on whether everything that happens on it is legit. With Bitcoin, miners are rewarded for this in the form of BTC. Unfortunately, this is not possible with side chains. So another solution must be devised to give miners a motivation to keep the network safe.
* In many cases, sidechains are not the best solution for solving scalability. If we look at global payment traffic, a few sidechains will not ensure that blockchain technology will be able to handle all this traffic. Communicating the side chains with the main chain will then still cause delays and expensive transactions.

# Examples of sidechains

## xDai

xDAI is the network which houses the first ever USD stable blockchain. Designed to be efficient and user friendly, the xDAI blockchain can process transactions instantaneously and in an inexpensive process and at the same time pegging the value to 1 USD per xDAI. The range of tools available for users makes xDAI easily adoptable by users looking to transfer value in an easy to use manner.

The xDAI chain is a EVM sidechain which is very similar to Ethereum but instead uses a different consensus model. The chain uses similar functionality as ETH 1.0 meaning developers can easily create their smart contract and develop them on the xDAI sidechain, with cheaper costs and quicker transfer times using the xDAI token.

Usage of the xDAI chain helps solving the problem of instability and congestion on the Ethereum network. Users can rely on xDAI to bypass Ethereum’s high gas fees when there is high traffic by using the xDAI chain.

## RSK

Rootstock (RSK) is a two-way pegged sidechain to Bitcoin intended to facilitate full Turing-complete smart contract functionality for the Bitcoin ecosystem. Along with improving transaction speeds and increasing scalability, it focuses on adding smart contract functionality to the Bitcoin ecosystem. The RSK Virtual Machine (RVM) is the core of the smart contract platform that enables EVM-compatible smart contracts to seamlessly run on RVM.

RSK can scale around 300 transactions per second without sacrificing decentralization and reduce storage space. Its new set of services is designed to advance transactability. RSK, with its protocols such as DECOR and GHOST, can even bring instant payments to the network, whereas transaction time in Bitcoin is much higher.

## Loom network

The Loom Network is an Ethereum-based sidechain platform focused on social media and gaming dApps. It aims to relieve congestion issues on Ethereum using offchain development and interoperability.

LOOM, the native ERC-20 cryptocurrency token of the Loom Network, is a membership token that’s staked for access to Loom Network dApps. Proprietary tokens can be created on sidechains. The Dapps on the Loom Network are called DAppChains and run on their own independent blockchains. Any consensus, rules, and other details can be customized per chain. Quite some projects are developed on Loom Network, and it’s expected to continue growing its ecosystem.

## Polygon

Polygon (MATIC), also classified as a commit chain, is a framework for creating interconnections between blockchain networks. It tries to address some of Ethereum's main limitations - including processing capacity, poor user experience (delayed transactions), and lack of community governance. Polygon does this by using a new sidechain solution.

The long-term goal is to enable an open, borderless world where users can seamlessly use various decentralized products and services without having to navigate through middlemen first. The aim is to create a hub to which different blockchains can easily connect, while overcoming some of their individual limitations, such as high cost, low scalability and limited security.

Polygon differentiates itself from “regular” sidechains because it uses a variety of extra technologies including:

* POS Chain: Polygon's main chain is an Ethereum sidechain known as the Matic POS Chain, which adds a layer of Proof of Participation (POS) security to blockchains launched on Polygon.
* Plasma chains: Polygon uses a scaling technology known as plasma to move assets between the base chain and the sidechains via plasma bridges.
* ZK Rollups: An alternative scaling solution used to merge a large number of off-chain transfers into a single transaction.
* Optimistic Rollups: A solution that works on top of Ethereum to facilitate near-instant transactions through the use of Proof of Fraud.

# Conclusion

As time goes by, more and more users are interacting with blockchains. Due to the limited scalability of blockchains, sidechains can be used to prevent blockchains to overload and improve overal scalability. The ultimate goal of sidechains is to make the main chain only focus on high-value transactions, pegging of sidechains and an overal safe environment.

Scalability roadmap cheat sheet,"There seems to be a lot of confusion about Ethereum's scalability going forward, partly due to evolving roadmaps and inconsistent communication by the distributed research and development teams. The biggest misconception I often see is that some magical thing called ""Eth 2.0"" will release and see gas prices plummet overnight on a given date - that's just not how it works. Ethereum is all about a series of incremental upgrades, that'll gradually increase scalability across various layers over time.

The bigger issue is that influencers don't seem to keep up either, which leads to the average user who gets their information from them being misinformed as well.

So, here's a cheatsheet for what is actually happening. Please note that it is speculative, and roadmaps are guaranteed to change as this space is fast evolving. But this is to the best of my knowledge at this given time. Please feel free to correct any errors, I'll edit the table accordingly.

You'll find various major upgrades over time versus the different layers in the Ethereum ecosystem, and the TPS they can do with each upgrade. I'll note that there'll be several other minor upgrades added along the way that could lead to safe gas limit increases. Note that a range is given, with the first number the rough average, and the second number if all transactions were simple ETH transfer. TPS is quite a misleading metric if you don't also account for how complex transactions are exactly. Anyway, it'll give you an idea.

||Now|EIP-1559 (July 2021)|zkPorter/StarkNet Validium release (Late 2021)|The Merge (Late 2021)|Data sharding (Late 2022?)|Statelessness + state expiry (2022/23)|Sharded execution (only if required)|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|**Ethereum mainnet**|20-55|Unchanged, but 40-110 in bursts|Unchanged|22-65|\>22-65|Hundreds|Thousands|
|**Rollups**|1,000-5,000|1,000-5,000|Unchanged|1,200-6,000|25,000 - 100,000|Hundreds of thousands|Unchanged|
|**zkPorter/Validium**|\>10,000|\>10,000|25,000 - 100,000|Unchanged|Unchanged|?|?|
|**Centralized sidechains**|Potentially millions, pick your poison|Unchanged|Unchanged|Unchanged|Maybe higher|Higher still|Higher still|

I'll also briefly (PS: OK, it turned out to be not brief at all, my apologies) walk you through the roadmap:

Currently, Ethereum mainnet is doing an average of 17-22 TPS (rounded up to 20 here), upto 55 TPS if all transactions were ETH transfers. Rollups live today can do >1,000 TPS, but this is assuming all activity moved to rollups and L1 was simply a settlement layer.

EIP-1559 will have no direct effect on scalability, but it may lead to lower gas prices as it'll mitigate users overpaying for gas. Also, it'll smooth out spikes during busy times so gas prices will definitely be much lower then. It'll do this by effectively doubling TPS temporarily, but of course, this will fall back to the average target over time. Additionally, as an example of minor upgrades, miners may choose to mildly bump up gas limit given gas tokens are gone, and the platform is maturing, but this is just speculation.

zkPorter and Validium are innovative solutions where data availability is maintained off-chain. Today, Validiums like DeversiFi or Immutable X have centralized data availability, but this can be decentralized with their own consensus mechanisms (to an extent, still far more centralized than Ethereum, just like alternate L1s). zkPorter is the first to offer this solution in October 2021, with StarkNet's solution coming in late 2021 or early 2022. Still highly speculative and there are many skeptics about general programmability with ZK rollups and off-chain data availability, but zkPorter is claimed to do 25,000+ TPS. Some will say this is a temporary measure before data sharding releases, and that's fair, but there can be multiple such solutions with their own consensus mechanisms post-sharding and varying centralization trade-offs for offering scalability if the data shards are saturated.

The Merge is a massive event, where Ethereum turns off mining and moves fully to proof-of-stake. However, it's not going to have any significant impact on scalability. Given the block time will reduce to a consistent 12 seconds, we'll see a mild bump.

Data sharding is what will bring massive scalability to rollups, potentially exceeding 100,000 TPS for ETH transfers. It will not affect mainnet scalability significantly, though we may see some L1 smart contracts start to use shards for data, freeing up space. We'll very likely see other minor protocol upgrades before data sharding, and if statelessness + state expiry is close, we can see validators start upping gas limits in anticipation.

Statelessness + state expiry is a highly underrated upgrade and what will give L1 scalability in a sustainable manner. If you follow Vitalik, you'll see a majority of his research activity this year has been around this. If this works out for Ethereum, I fully expect all blockchains to adopt similar state management models in the future. Gas limits can then be increased significantly. I don't know how significantly, though - if anyone has a clearer picture, please share.

Eventually, execution can be turned on shards, but only if/when required. This is when L1 will multiply by the number of shards, and combined with statelessness + state expiry, could lead to significant scalability on L1. However, rollups will continue to be the best solution for maximum scalability and be fairly mature by this time, which is why the jury is still out on when we'll actually need execution on shards. Will people care about high gas prices on L1 if everyone's transacting on rollups anyway? Not to mention, there'll be other solutions emerging to improve L1 scalability gradually.

While we're starting off with 64 shards, there can always be more shards added as the protocol matures. I'd bet there are more shards on chain by the time execution is turned on.

Finally, there's the elephant in the room. This will be controversial, but I believe centralized solutions are here to stay and complement Ethereum. We've seen Binance Smart Chain head down this route, but I think this road simply heads to a place where you have totally centralized sidechains run by financial services companies. Why would people use these? Millions of people already use CEXs not just for trading but also storing and transferring tokens. This is just the natural evolution to CEXs - enabling smart contract functionality in some form. They can run their private EVM chain (database?) with separate applications, but I think the smarter players will also act as aggregators for protocols on Ethereum mainnet and rollups. I believe OKEx is already doing this, where you can join their Yearn or Aave pools, and wallets like Dharma are also experimenting with it. Visa is effectively doing this too, potentially processing millions of transactions on their network, then settling in batches on Ethereum mainnet via third parties. The big clincher is that the UX is much simpler with centralized solutions for the average user that just wants to, say, lend/borrow, and doesn't really understand or care about decentralization. While all of this is regrettable, pragmatically, we've seen most popular tech win out long term due to their convenience factor versus objective qualities. With education, we can get more people to use trustless solutions.

Oh, and there are more exotic upgrades like a fully ZK Ethereum network, but that's several years down the road.

"Last night, the Flippening began in earnest","It's very simple: it's all about selling narratives to normies and the institutions who bend the knee to their every whim and desire. With Elon ""discovering"" (lol) that BTC is ""bad for the environment,"" he set in motion the gears that will lead us toward The Merge and the inevitable Flippening.

Sure, there are other more green cryptos, but we all know these ""L1's"" actually compete with Ethereum's L2 -- they sacrifice centralization and security for scalability. With 90% or so of all blockchain developers on Ethereum and with the ROBUST Defi, NFT and plethora of other dApps having been developed by them to strengthen Ethereum's ecosystem and legitimacy (fantastic podcast by the BANKLESS dudes with Vitalik the other day on this topic, btw), even if these L2's offered some incremental value above Ethereum (spoiler, they do not), the book has already been written.

Eth is already investment-grade (other L1s are not), and knowing how slow institutional investors are to trust new speculative assets, it's pretty clear that ESG-obsessed investors will be looking to park in Eth as we head into the merge. Layer on top of that EIP-1559, the triple-halving and Eth2 becoming a truly deflationary and yield bearing asset, MY LORD, it's clear as day where this ends.

A Detailed Summary of Every Single Reason Why I am Bullish on ETH. (2021 Edition!),"The following will be a list of the many reasons why I hold and am extremely bullish on ETH. This is an updated version of [a post I made 6 months ago by the same title,](https://old.reddit.com/r/ethtrader/comments/jhrqv1/a_detailed_summary_of_every_single_reason_why_i/) so if it sounds familiar, then it probably is. However, there are a lot of new faces here who could learn a lot from the info in this post.

#This is an extremely long post. If you just want the hopium without the detail, read the TL;DR at the bottom.

#ETH 2.0

As most of you will already know, ETH 2.0 launched successfully back in December 2020 and has been running smoothly without a hiccup ever since. To date, it has locked up over 4 million ETH and growing. Since then, the devs have been working on the next phase of ETH 2.0 and have decided to fast-track the merge from Proof of Work to Proof of Stake. This will bring some major benefits including:

- A 99.9% increase in efficiency, making Ethereum by far the largest environmentally friendly blockchain.
- Greater network security than PoW due to efficiencies with PoW and slashing which can punish dishonest validators/attackers.
- A ~80-90% drop in ETH inflation from around 5%pa to well below 1%pa. This will reduce the current daily sell pressure of $50,000,000/day of new ETH being sold by miners to offset electricity costs to just $5,000,000-$10,000,000/day going to stakers who will sell less due to not having any significant operating expenses to pay off.
- An increase in ETH 2.0 staking rewards from the current 7.5% to [as much as 20% due to miner/validator extractable value and network fees/tips.](nitter.snopyta.org/drakefjustin/status/1384124998084792324) (Note: a 20% roi on staking will not be a permanent thing and will likely drop back down to single digit returns quite fast.)

This upgrade is currently running in testnet and is slated for as early as October this year or very conservative estimates as Q1 2022.

ETH 2.0 doesn’t end there though! There are still 2 more main upgrades to come after the merge. One of these is the introduction of shards. shards are essentially parallel blockchains which are each responsible for a different part of Ethereum’s workload, think of it like a multi-core processor vs a single core processor. At first, it is likely that these shards will only act as data availability layers and won’t actually process transactions yet. However, their data can be utilised by the L2 scaling solution, rollups, [increasing Ethereum’s throughput in transactions per second up to 100,000 TPS](nitter.snopyta.org/VitalikButerin/status/1277961594958471168). 

Following this upgrade comes the really big base layer scaling benefits. Each shard will be fully functional chains (or possibly partially functional shards each with specific purposes, this is yet to be determined). With 64 of them, we can expect the base layer of Ethereum to scale around 64x, not including the massive scaling which comes from layer 2 scaling solutions like rollups as previously mentioned. Finally, this will likely also introduce web assembly or “eWASM” which will allow contracts to be programmed in a wide range of programming languages, opening the floodgates for millions of web devs who want to be involved in Ethereum but don’t know Ethereum’s programming language, Solidity.

#EIP-1559 and ETH scarcity

As I covered in [a previous post of mine,](https://old.reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/izhkvk/minimum_viable_issuance_why_ethereums_lack_of_a/) ETH doesn’t have a supply cap like Bitcoin. Instead, it has a monetary policy of “minimum viable issuance”, not only is this is a good thing for network security, but with the addition of EIP-1559, it leaves the door open to the possibility of ETH issuance going negative. In short, EIP-1559 changes the fee market to make transaction prices more efficient (helping to alleviate high gas fees!) by burning a variable base fee which changes based on network usage demand rather than using a highest bidder market where miners simply include who pays them the most. This will result in most of the ETH being paid in transaction fees being burned. As of late, the amount which would be burned if EIP-1559 was in Ethereum right now [would make ETH a deflationary asset!](nitter.snopyta.org/VitalikButerin/status/1291869925863129088)

Best of all, EIP-1559 is almost certainly going live with the London hard fork on the 14th of July! ETH becoming [ultra sound money](https://external-content.duckduckgo.com/iu/?u=https%3A%2F%2Fi.imgur.com%2FDyjJE5u.jpg&f=1&nofb=1) is almost imminent!

#Layer 2 Scaling

In the mean time while we are waiting for the final phases of ETH 2.0, layer 2 scaling is here. Right now, projects such as Deversifi or Loopring utilise rollups to scale to thousands of tx/s on their decentralised exchange platforms or HoneySwap which uses xDai to offer a more scalable alternative to UniSwap. Speaking of which, big DeFi players like UniSwap and Synthetix are actively testing using optimistic rollups to scale while maintaining composability between DeFi platforms. The most bullish thing about L2 scaling is all of the variety of options. Here’s a non exhaustive list of Ethereum L2 scaling solutions:
- Aztec protocol (L2 scaling + privacy!)
- ZKSync
- Loopring
- Raiden
- Arbitrum Rollups
- xDai
- OMGNetwork
- Polygon (formerly)
- FuelLabs
- Starkware
- Optimism
- Celer Network
- + Many more

Best of all, since the previous edition of this post, value locked in layer 2s has exploded!

#DeFi and Composability

If you’re reading this, I am sure you are aware of the phenomena which is Decentralised Finance (DeFi or more accurately, open finance). Ethereum is the first platform to offer permissionless and immutable financial services which when interacting with each other, lead to unprecedented composability and innovation in financial applications. A whole new world of possibilities are opening up thanks to this composability as it allows anyone to take existing pieces of open source code from other DeFi projects, put them together like lego pieces (hence the term money legos) and create something the world has never seen before. None of this was possible before Ethereum because typically financial services are heavily regulated and FinTech is usually proprietary software, so you don’t have any open source lego bricks to build off and you have to build everything you need from scratch. That is if what you want to do is even legal for a centralised institution!

Unsurprisingly, since the last time I shared this post, the total value locked in DeFi has exploded from just over $10 billion to almost $100 billion!

#NFTs and tokeniation

NFTs or “Non-Fungible Tokens” - a previously niche form of crypto asset last time I shared this post has now exploded into the mainstream. While many folks are still very hesitant to adopt them or just don’t see the point, this reaction from the masses seems very similar to people seeming very confused as to why anyone would want to stream music if radio already exists when Bill Gates talked about the future of the internet back in the 1990s. Over time, these things simply work their way into the mainstream consciousness and work they way into the back end of products and services we already use.

So far, it has mostly just been art NFTs which have broken into the mainstream. This is only just scratching the surface of what NFTs and tokenisation have to offer. There are also human readable names for your ETH address (see [ENS names](https://ens.domains/) and [unstoppable domains](https://unstoppabledomains.com/)), breedable virtual collectible creatures like [crypto kitties](https://www.cryptokitties.co/), ownable in game assets like [Gods Unchained cards](https://godsunchained.com/) or best of all in my opinion, tokenised ownership of real world assets which can even be split into pieces (this doesn’t necessarily require an NFT. Fungible tokens can be/are used for some of the following use cases). This could be tokenised ownership of real estate (see [RealT](https://realt.co/)), tokenised ownership of stocks, bonds and other financial assets (which by the way makes them tradable 24/7 and divisible unlike through the traditional system) or even tokenised ownership of the future income of a celebrity or athlete (see when [NBA Star Spencer Dinwiddie Tokenized His Own NBA Contract.
](https://news.bitcoin.com/nba-star-spencer-dinwiddie-just-tokenized-his-own-contract/)

#Institutional Adoption

Ethereum is by far the most widely adopted blockchain by enterprises. Ethereum’s [Enterprise Ethereum Alliance](https://entethalliance.org/) (EEA) is the largest blockchain-enterprise partnership program and Ethereum is by far the most frequently leveraged blockchain for proof of concepts and innovation in the blockchain space by enterprises. Meanwhile, there are protocols like the [Baseline protocol](https://docs.baseline-protocol.org/) which is a shared framework which allows enterprises to use Ethereum as a common frame of reference and a base settlement layer without having to give up privacy when settling on the public Ethereum mainnet. This framework makes adopting Ethereum much easier for other enterprises.

#Institutional Investment

One of Bitcoin’s biggest things it has going for it right now is the growing institutional investment. In case you were wondering, Ethereum has this too! Grayscale offers investment in the cryptocurrency space for financial institutions and their Ethereum fund has already locked up millions of ETH and an ETH ETF already exists in Canada. Not only this, but as businesses transact on Ethereum and better understand it, not only will they buy up ETH to pay for their transactions, but they will also realise that much like Bitcoin, Ethereum is a scarce asset. Better yet, a scarce asset which offers yield when staking. As a result, I expect to see companies having ETH holdings become the norm just like how Bitcoin is becoming more widespread on companies’ balance sheets.

#The state of global markets

With asset prices in almost every asset class at or near all-time highs and interest rates lower than ever and even negative in some cases, there really aren’t many good opportunities in the traditional financial system right now. Enter crypto - clearly the next evolution of financial services (as I explained in the section on DeFi earlier in this post), with scarce assets built in at the protocol layer, buying BTC or ETH is a lot like buying shares in TCP/IP in 1990 (that is if the underlying protocols of the internet could be invested in which they couldn’t). ~~Best of all, major cryptos are down from their all-time highs anywhere between 35% for BTC or 70% for ETH and much more for many altcoins. This means that they can significantly appreciate in value before entering uncharted, speculative bubble territory.~~ 6 months on from when I first wrote that and unsurprisingly crypto is at all-time highs. However, so are most asset classes. And best of all, now with ETH staking live, Ethereum now effectively pays a dividend of 7.5% if you stake. This is enormous compared to dividends in traditional finance which these days are often as low as 1-2%.

While of course we could fall dramatically at any moment in the current macro financial conditions and recent rise of crypto, as a longer term play, crypto is very alluring. The existing financial system has shown that it is in dire need of replacing and the potential replacement has started rearing its beautiful head in the form of crypto and DeFi.

#Improvements in user onboarding and abstracting away complexity

Ethereum has started making huge leaps forward in terms of usability for the end user. We now have ENS names and unstoppable domains which allow you to send ETH to yournamehere.ETH or TrickyTroll.crypto (I don’t actually have that domain, that’s just an example). No longer do you have to check every character of your ugly hexadecimal 0x43AB96D… ETH address to ensure you’re sending your ETH to the right person. We also have smart contract wallets like [Argent wallet](https://www.argent.xyz/) or the Gnosis safe. These allow for users to access their wallets and interact with DeFi self-custodially from an app on their phone without having to record a private key or recovery phrase. Instead, they offer social recovery and their UI is straight forward enough for anyone who uses a smart phone to understand. Finally, for the more experienced users, DApps like Uniswap have pretty, super easy to use graphical user interfaces and can be used by anyone who knows how to run and use a browser extension like Metamask.

#The lack of an obvious #1 ETH killer

One of Ethereum’s biggest threats is for it to be overthrown by a so-called “Ethereum killer” blockchain which claims to do everything Ethereum can do and sometimes more. While there are competitors which are each formidable to a certain extent such as Polkadot, Cardano and EOS, each have their own weaknesses. For example, Polkadot and Cardano are not fully operational yet and EOS is much more centralised than Ethereum. As a result, none of these competitors have any significant network effects just yet relative to the behemoth which is Ethereum.

Also, undoubtedly you will have heard of Binance Smart Chain by now. The favourite chain of any new investor with pocket money to gamble on shitcoins but not enough to warrant paying $10-$100 for a totally permissionless Uniswap transaction. However, Binance Smart Chain isn’t really an ETH killer. Not only is it basically a copy paste of Ethereum with block sizes adjusted to be incredibly large (and according to the developer who built Geth, the node software which BSC uses, dangerously large to the point he thinks it could break) but BSC is also centralised with just 21 nodes run by operators with close ties to Binance. I’m not bashing on BSC here, credit is due for them finding a niche and dominating it, but it is important to note that BSC is *a lot more centralised than Ethereum.* Hence it is cheaper. Also, I would argue its existence is good for ETH as it has siphoned off users who may have moved to an actually decentralised or semi-decentralised ETH killer. Instead, BSC has taken these users, hampering actual ETH killer adoption while BSC is too centralised to see any institutional adoption which is one of the things which separates ETH from its competition.

This doesn’t mean that these projects aren’t a threat. In fact, I am sure that projects like Polkadot (which is more focused on complimenting Ethereum than killing it) will take a slice out of Ethereum’s pie. However, I am still very confident that Ethereum will remain on top due to the lack of a clear number 2 smart contract platform. Since none of these ETH killers stands out as the second place smart contract platform, it makes it much harder for one project to create a network effect which even begins to threaten Ethereum’s dominance. This leads me onto my next reason - network effects.

#Network effects

This is another topic which I made a [previous post on.](https://old.reddit.com/r/ethtrader/comments/guffdj/the_network_effect_is_king_what_i_have_learned/) The network effect is why Bitcoin is still the number one cryptocurrency and by such a long way. Bitcoin is not the most technologically advanced cryptocurrency. However, it has the most widespread name recognition and the most adoption in most metrics (ETH beats it in some metrics these days). The network effect is also why most people use Zoom and Facebook messenger/WhatsApp despite the existence of free, private, end to end encrypted alternatives which have all the same features (https://meet.jit.si/ for zoom alternative and Signal for the private messenger app. I highly recommend both. Let’s get their network effects going!). It is the same for Bitcoin. People don’t want to have to learn about or set up a wallet for alternative options. People like what is familiar and what other people use. Nobody wants to be “that guy” who makes you download yet another app and account you have to remember the password/private key for. In the same way, Enterprises don’t want to have to create a bridge between their existing systems and a dozen different blockchains. Developers don’t want to have to create DeFi money legos from scratch on a new chain if they can just plug in to existing services like Uniswap. Likewise, users don’t want to have to download another browser extension to use DApps on another chain if they already use Ethereum. I know personally I have refrained from investing in altcoins because I would have to install another app on my hardware wallet or remember another recovery phrase.

Overthrowing Ethereum’s network effect is one hell of a big task these days. Time is running out for the ETH killers.

#Ethereum is the most decentralised and provably neutral smart contract platform

Ethereum is also arguably the most decentralised and provably neutral smart contract platform. Unlike some smart contract platforms, you can’t round up everyone at the Ethereum Foundation or any select group of people and expect to be able to stop the network. Not only this, but the Ethereum foundation doesn’t have the ability to print more ETH or push through changes as they wish like some people would lead you on to believe. The community would reject detrimental EIPs and hard fork. Ever since the DAO hack, the Ethereum community has made it clear that it will not accept EIPs which attempt to roll back the chain even to recover hacked funds (see EIP-999).

Even if governments around the world wanted to censor the Ethereum blockchain, under ETH 2.0’s proof of stake, it would be incredibly costly and would require a double digit percentage of the total ETH supply, much of which would be slashed (meaning they would lose it) as punishment for running dishonest validator nodes. This means that unlike with proof of work where a 51% attacker can keep attacking the network, under proof of stake, an attacker can only perform the attack a few times before they lose all of their ETH. This makes attacks much less financially viable than it is on proof of work chains. Network security is much more than what I laid out above and I am far from an expert but the improved resistance to 51% attacks which PoS provides is significant.

Finally, with the US dollar looking like it will lose its reserve currency status and the existing wire transfer system being outdated, superpowers like China won’t want to use US systems and the US won’t want to use a Chinese system. Enter Ethereum, the provably neutral settlement layer where the USA and China don’t have to trust each other or each other’s banks because they can trust Ethereum. While it may sound like a long shot, it does make sense if Ethereum hits a multi-trillion dollar market cap that it is the most secure and neutral way to transfer value between these adversaries. Not to mention if much of the world’s commerce were to be settled in the same place - on Ethereum - then it would make sense for governments to settle on the same platform.

#ETH distribution is decentralised

Thanks to over 5 years of proof of work - a system where miners have to sell newly minted ETH to pay for electricity costs - newly mined ETH has found its way into the hands of everyday people who buy ETH off miners selling on exchnages. As pointed out by u /AdamSC1 in [his analysis of the top 10K ETH addresses](https://medium.com/@adamscochran/the-10k-audit-42c100dd32bb) (I highly recommend reading this if you haven’t already), the distribution of ETH is actually slightly more decentralised than Bitcoin with the top 10,000 ETH wallets holding 56.70% of ETH supply compared to the top 10,000 Bitcoin wallets which hold 57.44% of the Bitcoin supply. This decentralised distribution means that the introduction of staking won’t centralise ETH in the hands of a few wallets who could then control the network. This is an advantage for ETH which many proof of stake ETH killers will never have as they never used PoW to distribute funds widely throughout the community and these ETH killers often did funding rounds giving large numbers of tokens to VC investors.

#The community

Finally, while I may be biased, I think that Ethereum has the friendliest community. Anecdotally, I find that the Ethereum developer community is full of forward thinking people who want to make the world a better place and build a better future, many of whom are altruistic and don’t always act in their best interests, Vitalik being one of the best examples as he holds less than 0.3% of the total ETH supply, a remarkable small percentage for any founder of a multi-billion dollar company or cryptocurrency (for reference, Jeff Bezos owns about 10% of Amazon and Satoshi owns about 5% of all Bitcoins). Not to mention his many charitable donations, including $1 billion dollars worth of SHIB sent to the Indian COVID relief fund (sure, there isn’t $1 billion worth of liquidity in those SHIB tokens but it’s still a hell of a lot of money). Compare this to the much more conservative, “at least we’re safe while the world burns” attitude which many Bitcoiners have. I don’t want to generalise too much here as the Bitcoin community is great too and there are some wonderful people there. But the difference is clear if you compare the daily discussion of r/Bitcoin to the incredibly helpful and welcoming daily discussion of r/EthFinance who will [happily answer your noob questions without calling you an idiot and telling you to do you own research](https://old.reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/jh3zyy/daily_general_discussion_october_24_2020/g9vg1jw/) (there are plenty more examples in any of the daily threads). Or the very helpful folks over at r/EthStaker who will go out of their way to help you set up an ETH 2.0 staking node on the mainnet or testnets (Shoutout to u/superphiz who does a lot of work over in that sub!). Don’t believe me? Head over to those subs and see for yourself.

**Please don’t hate on me if you disagree about which project has the best community, it is just my very biased personal opinion and I respect your opinion if you disagree! :)**

#TL;DR: 
- **ETH 2.0** - Huge scaling and better tokenomics. ETH is about to be [ultra sound money](https://external-content.duckduckgo.com/iu/?u=https%3A%2F%2Fi.imgur.com%2FDyjJE5u.jpg&f=1&nofb=1)

Rollups vs. L1s,"My greatest observation from comments in my previous post: there is a general mental block around rollups in the crypto community. I made the mistake of assuming this sub would be familiar with rollups, but that's clearly not the case. It's understandable - rollups are complex bleeding-edge new tech. Many don't seem to be considering that these are superior solutions to L1s. I've actually already made this case before, [Opinion: Rollups are 4th gen blockchains](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/my0h9s/opinion_rollups_are_4th_gen_blockchains/), but here I'll be considering a more direct comparison. I'll be simplifying things here so people can understand easily - not everything will be strictly accurate.

**Rollups are directly comparable and competitive with L1s.** The implication here is that a smart contract rollup is a direct alternative to an L1. zkSync 2.0, Arbitrum, Optimistic Ethereum, StarkNet, OMGX, Cartesi and others are direct alternatives to Avalanche, EOS, Tron, Algorand, Binance Smart Chain, Cosmos, Solana, Polkadot, and yes, even Ethereum etc. Yet, when I see people comparing smart contract platforms, rollups are suspiciously missing from the comparisons. It's time to evolve our mental models and start evaluating the smart contract space in a more holistic manner. 

Currently, we have multiple rollups online, such as Loopring, zkSync, dYdX, Immutable X\*, Aztec, DeversiFi\*, Hermez etc. This is proven technology that simply works. Most of these rollups do thousands of TPS and have gas fees so low some even subsidize them (or abstract them away) so users effectively pay zero gas. You'll have to see it to believe - try dYdX for yourself. Instant transactions, zero gas fees, it's the future everyone dreamed of but is here today. However, much like the early days in blockchain before smart contract platforms grew into prominence, these rollups are currently application specific. For example, zkSync only processes payments at this time, much like Bitcoin is purely peer-to-peer money. BitShares is a blockchain purely for a DEX, just like dYdX is a rollup purely for a DEX. Immutable X is for NFTs, just like Flow, so on and so forth. Sure, you can build applications on top of them, but they are limited to specific application scenarios. The point here is rollups are now where L1s were in \~2015, before applications started building on smart contract chains instead of developing their own.

However, rollups are set to enter the programmable smart contracts era imminently. First to release will be Arbitrum, on May 28th. It's worth noting that Optimism has been live since January, but is till date restricted to Synthetix. Uniswap V3, Chainlink and others will release over the coming weeks/months, but the full public launch is only due for July at the earliest. zkSync 2.0's testnet goes live this month with mainnet in August if all goes well, with StarkNet also due later this year. It's to important note that some of the MVPs we see release shortly may have some missing features like decentralized sequencers or efficient signature aggregation, but we're looking at rollups as a long-term solution in this post. 

Let's revisit the blockchain trilemma - decentralization, security and scalability - you can never have all three, despite what marketing materials from projects may claim. Most L1s today significantly sacrifice decentralization to get the required scalability. For example, EOS and Binance Smart Chain have 21 validators; Tron 27; Algorand \~100, Cosmos \~150; Polkadot, Avalanche, Solana have a few hundreds, Cardano a couple of thousand, Ethereum \~135,000. All of these chains are making varying magnitudes of trade-offs between the three. There are other nuances like Cosmos and Avalanche trading off security with their multi-chain nature, delegated-type consensus mechanisms featuring cabalization risks, single entities running multiple validators, but those are for another time.

By and large, you can see the significant flaw here - all chains other than Ethereum have too few validators, and require high-spec machines to run 24x7. As a result, some of these like EOS, Solana or Binance Smart Chain are already so expensive to run that only very wealthy people can run nodes - they are no longer trustless networks and require you to trust the validators. Things will only get worse over time as the state bloats into several TBs and beyond. There's nothing wrong with that, it's just a different trade-off. 

This is where rollups are genius, and I don't use the term lightly. They are easily the third greatest invention in the blockchain space, after Bitcoin invented cryptoeconomics and Ethereum invented smart contracts. Well, zero-knowledge cryptography is pretty amazing too. **What if you could leverage all the benefits of a fast L1, while simply subcontracting out consensus and data work to a different, stronger chain?** It's classic division of labour - 2 specialists will always do a better job than 2 generalists. 

That is precisely what rollups are - blockchains in their own right, but one which does not have its own consensus mechanism and data layer, and relies on a different chain - let's call it parent chain. It simply executes transactions very fast, ""compresses"" the outputs, and ""saves"" the data on parent chain. (This is deliberately oversimplified.) 

This can lead to great efficiencies, VM innovations, and offer scaling far beyond anything L1s can ever offer - restricted only by the data limits of the parent chain\*. So what happens if the rollup fails? This is where things get interesting - a rollup's **complete state can be reconstructed** from parent chain, which means it is 100% as secure and decentralized as the main chain. 

Today, all rollups have opted to leverage Ethereum, because obviously it's the only massively decentralized smart contract chain there is. Ethereum's roadmap has been built around being the best parent chain for rollups. After The Merge, data sharding will release on Ethereum, offering massive data availability. This will accelerate rollups to 100,000 TPS - scalability you simply cannot achieve purely on any L1 in any sustainable manner. Can a chain offer a better consensus and data layer than Ethereum? Absolutely. But that doesn't matter, this post is not about Ethereum - rollups will simply improve with a better solution. 

But wait - rollups can also have their own data layers and consensus mechanisms to further accelerate throughput, building on top of the rollup. This is the scheme being used by zkPorter or \*Validium. zkPorter is scaling to 25,000 - 100,000 TPS as early as October this year. Even more interestingly, users can choose between the rollup and validium options on the fly - called Volition. Think of a situation where you're doing a DEX swap - you get to choose your fee. $0.3 for a swap on rollup with maximum security, or trade-off some for a $0.03 fee. Meanwhile, this would cost $30 on Ethereum L1. 

I hear you ask - what about interoperability or composability? Well, if you believe in a multi-chain world, it's no different from L1s. Exchanges can and will offer direct deposits and withdrawals to/from rollups (OKEx has announced support for Arbitrum; Coinbase for Optimistic Ethereum, and more will join surely). There'll be bridges between rollups - just like we have between L1s. The experience for the end user will be very similar to using any L1. Indeed, rollups sharing a parent chain can further innovate with more seamless interoperability that would simply not be possible between multiple L1s.StarkWare's Caspian is a great example of this - keeping all liquidity on Ethereum L1, shared between various different Ethereum L2s. The biggest drawback is that optimistic rollups do have a 1 week withdrawal delay, which is clearly far inferior to L1s. However, this can be easily mitigated using liquidity bridges, and ZK rollups like StarkNet and zkSync 2.0 have instant withdrawals. Finally, what if you don't believe in a multi-chain world and think only one L1 will do it all? Well, that's simply impossible - like I mentioned above no L1 will ever have enough scalability for global demand, short of some exotic technologies that do not yet exist. Innovations like rollups are imperative for the blockchain world to satisfy global demand. 

In short, rollups offer **greater scalability, security and decentralization than all L1s,** and offer a very similar user experience otherwise. My bold prediction is that by 2022/23, 90+% of retail transactions will happen on rollups. We've already seen Polygon transition from being an L1 (sidechains/commitchains are not L2) to developing rollups, and I expect many more projects to join the fray. The real ""Eth killers"" are not EOS, Binance Smart Chain, Algorand or Cosmos - they are StarkNet, zkSync 2.0, Arbitrum or Optimism.",28.0,2021-05-13 05:33:26,0.91
ETH2 Staking Guide,"**ETH Staking Primer**

Okay so before I get into it, Ethereum is moving to a proof of stake system from the current proof of work that has nodes mining blocks with hash power derived from their GPUs. Right now, proof of work is securing the network, but there is also a “Beacon Chain” running on proof of stake, and these two concurrently running chains will merge around the end of this year. At that point, mining is over for Ethereum and it’s all proof of stake from then on. It’s important to note that you won’t be able to unstake the ETH until after this merge takes place, which will be Q4 2021 at the earliest. 

So with ETH skyrocketing and tons of dApps revolutionizing the digital financial system, everyone who’s anyone wants to stake some ETH. But how? Well, there’s 3 main ways: run your own node, stake in a centralized exchange, or in a DeFi stake pool. Each have advantages and drawbacks. *This post is specific to US residents, although many of these options are available worldwide.*

**Running a node**

This option requires you to stake in increments of 32 ETH. If you have that much, I highly recommend considering it. But, if you have that much ETH, I’m sure you’ve already considered it. The technical requirements aren’t very high, you pretty much just need a stable internet connection, since downtime will hurt your returns. Then you install some software on your computer, stake the ETH, and run it 24/7. 

https://ethereum.org/en/eth2/staking/

**Centralized Exchange**

On these you can generally stake any amount 

**Coinbase**- Coinbase takes a 25% fee from any returns and you get the rest. There is no option to withdraw staked ETH, although they plan to allow for it “later this year.” https://help.coinbase.com/en/coinbase/trading-and-funding/staking/ethereum-2-0-staking

**Kraken**- retains an administrative fee of 15%. Very similar to Coinbase. https://support.kraken.com/hc/en-us/articles/360052734432-Ethereum-2-0-staking-FAQ

**Gemini**- plans to offer ETH staking, this doesn’t seem to be live yet. https://www.gemini.com/blog/gemini-to-support-ethereum-2-0-trading-and-staking

**Binance**- this is not available in the US, but let’s face it, a lot of us use it anyway. They offer staking in increments of .1 ETH. https://www.binance.com/en/eth2

**Decentralized Stake Pools**

**Rocket Pool**- this is the most well-known DeFi stake pool. They’ll allow .01 ETH to be staked and take a 10% fee. There’s an option to be a node operator with 16 ETH, where the other 16 is provided to you from the pool and you get more of the rewards. They also plan to give you a tradeable rETH token which will allow you to move your staked ETH. 

This option is currently not live; audits are being completed. Most guesses on Discord seem to peg a launch date in July or so. https://www.rocketpool.net/

**Lido**- this is live, but they warn that this is NOT AVAILABLE IN THE US. Use at your own risk. Current rate is 5.5%. https://lido.fi/

**Stakewise**- this one works much like Rocket Pool. The team is based out of Estonia, they claim that it is legal and available in the US. It’s definitely a legitimate project, with an audited and trustless contract. 10% fee, lower gas to deposit than Rocket Pool, and has their own tradeable token along with a separate rewards token that they plan to use to allow compounding interest, although this aspect isn’t available yet. For people who don’t want to wait for Rocket Pool, this seems like a good option. https://stakewise.io/

These are only a few options. Many more are listed on the Ethereum website; they advise you to DYOR regarding the risks. https://beaconcha.in/stakingServices

Well, there you have it. Tons of options, none of them perfect lol. I’d advise anyone to take their time deciding. Once you put your ETH in one of these pools or start a node, it’s locked up for the better part of a year, so make sure you know what you’re getting into. Happy staking!",90.0,2021-05-12 12:43:59,0.96

# Ethereum can't scale

This is demonstrably false because there are multiple rollups currently online, some of which have been running for a year now! Here are some examples that you can use today: Loopring, zkSync, DeversiFi, Hermez, Aztec, dYdX, Immutable X etc. Most of these projects can process thousands of TPS with such low gas fees that some of them subsidize it (or abstract it away from UX), so the users effectively pay zero gas.

What's missing are generalized programmable rollups. Optimism has been live on mainnet since January, but is currently restricted to only Synthetix. Uniswap V3 is the next major release on Optimism, before finally opening it up for public smart contract deployment in July or later. By the way, Optimism have done a *terrible* job with communications this year - criticism is certainly due here. Engineering-focused project or not, communications & public relations are always important.

But Optimism is just one solution. Other solutions like zkSync 2.0, Arbitrum and StarkNet will be rolling out over the course of the year, and we have more like OMGX and Cartesi joining the fray. Indeed, it now seems likely Arbitrum will be publicly available ahead of Optimism. Not to mention sidechains or commitchains like Polygon or xDai, or other EVM chains like BSC or Avalanche. Ultimately, all of these are part of the extended Ethereum ecosystem and bridge back to Ethereum mainnet.

At the same time, this is also partially true. I will note that Ethereum L1 gas fees will likely remain high forever, short of some exotic technology that doesn't yet exist. Even on rollups, you're not going to get dirt cheap fees until data sharding is released, which is a couple of years away, and even that won't be enough long term. And that's just fine... There's simply overwhelming demand for EVM blockspace.

# High gas fees will kill Ethereum

This is one of those bizarre comments that pervades through crypto retail that doesn't seem to make any sense. Overwhelming demand for a product will somehow... kill a project? It's like saying AMD and Nvidia are going to die soon because graphics cards are now grotesquely overpriced.

No, the reality, like I said above, is that there's overwhelming demand for EVM blockspace and a limited supply of gas. Currently, the high fees shows there's incredible demand for Ethereum L1 blockspace, and people are willing to pay a steep premium for it.

**This is what gives the Ethereum network and ETH value. And in two months' time, there'll be a mechanism with EIP-1559 to accrue this value to every ETH stakeholder.**

Over time, we will see gas fees drop with a greater supply of gas - the reality is that there'll never quite be enough blockspace supply to satisfy global demand for EVM blockspace long term on Ethereum L1. There'll be rollups, there'll be hybrid solutions like zkPorter/Validium, there'll be sidechains/alternate chains, and there'll be centralized solutions. The ecosystem will work together to offer different trade-offs with decentralization versus transaction fees.

# Ethereum is centralized, all decisions are made by Vitalik

While Vitalik remains an important part of the Ethereum ecosystem, Ethereum development has become sufficiently decentralized over time. Unique to Ethereum is a multi-client approach, where researchers work with developers to create plain text specifications. These specifications are then implemented by multiple client developers who work independently. This is different to all other blockchain projects where the core team develops a single client. Now, of course, there are arguments for a single client - putting all resources into one client could make for a higher quality client than 4 or 5 not-as-high-quality client, but this is clearly the most decentralized approach. For example, there are currently 4 consensus layer clients in production, and 1 more in development - all developed by teams independent of the Ethereum Foundation (apart from receiving grants). For any consensus forks, these 5 development teams have to agree on upgrades, and then 135,000+ validators do as well. This is not how a centralized network functions. Not to mention Ethereum's strong ""Layer 0"" that all developers and validators listen to intently - its community. For example, EIP-1559 has been significantly motivated by the will of the community.

# Ethereum was premined. Ethereum is controlled by Vitalik. (u/aaqy, u/ec265)

I'm not a fan of ICOs, and Ethereum certainly did have one. I don't like ninja mining either, like Bitcoin. We have seen some DeFi projects have fair launches with airdrops to users, and this is certainly the best way to distribute tokens.

However, It's important to understand the context - back in 2014 this was simply the fairest way to raise funding. At genesis, Ethereum Foundation held \~12M ETH. However, over the years, this has been distributed - a lot of it seems to be fundraising in the early years. Currently Ethereum Foundation and early developers hold \~2% of the supply at most. Vitalik owns 0.3% of all ETH.

Contrast this with other projects where the founders often hold 20% or more, public corporations like Tesla or Amazon with a similar amount, or Satoshi holding 5% of all BTC. (Was as high as 50+% in 2009/10, and yes, they are assumed lost and not comparable anyway.) I would even go ahead and say that 0.3% is absolutely not enough to adequately incentivize a founder to keep working on the project!

Would I have preferred to see Ethereum do a fairer launch? Sure. But today, in the here and now, Ethereum has the fairest distribution among founders of any project.

# Mining is destroying the environment

While there are nuances to do this, this one's actually true to an extent - mining is highly inefficient. Fortunately, Ethereum is moving to proof-of-stake within the next 9 months, which will cut Ethereum's energy consumption by 99+%.

It's not just about electricity either. We know there's a significant global shortage for semiconductors right now. A lot of TSMC's limited wafer supply currently being used to fabricate mining-related silicon (ASICs, GPUs) can be reallocated towards CPUs, ASICs and GPUs more productive usecases like engineering, science, and of course, gaming.

# Ethereum did a rollback and will do it again

People like to point to the DAO fork as proof that Ethereum is not immutable. But there are many nuances to this that are disingenuously ignored:

\- Firstly, the DAO fork was not a rollback. It was a unique situation where the hackers had to wait 28 days for withdrawals, so a smart contract change was executed.

\- There was strong consensus across developers, users, miners and community alike - it was hardly a centralized decision.

\- Those who disagreed simply moved to Ethereum Classic. It's a win-win situation for all.

\- Ethereum was still a very, very new project then. You know which other project did a rollback when it was less than 2 years old?  [Value overflow incident - Bitcoin Wiki](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Value_overflow_incident)

\- [EIP-999 being rejected](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-999.md) is the final deathblow to this hypothesis. There was a chance to rollback 500,000 ETH to an entity managed by one of its co-founders, and the community overwhelmingly rejected it. **Rollbacks do not happen on Ethereum.**

# Ethereum relies on Infura

While it's certainly true that Infura is a dominant service provider, and the ecosystem definitely needs to diversify, this is demonstrably false. Infura [suffered a massive outage in November 2020](https://blog.infura.io/infura-mainnet-outage-post-mortem-2020-11-11/), yet Ethereum kept running just fine. Sure, it disrupted some frontends, exchanges and wallets, but nothing that couldn't be fixed with simply running your own node or using a different service. Since this outage, many frontends and wallets have started running their own nodes and using alternatives like Alchemy. There's still more work to do on this front, but to say Ethereum is reliant on Infura is false.

# Ethereum state is growing too fast

Compared to Bitcoin, this is certainly true. If you want a chain that's easiest to play back in archival mode, verify every transaction from genesis, then yes, Bitcoin is a better option. It's just a question of how valuable this really is - given you're trusting Bitcoin miners already if you want to use their network? With Ethereum, you can run full nodes (not archive) on a Raspberry Pi 4 with a 1 TB SSD, and send and verify transactions. This is relatively accessible hardware to most users and consumers. Some would argue that clients like TurboGeth makes this easy enough even for archive nodes.

On a related note, Ethereum's state growth is much, much closer to Bitcoin than Binance Smart Chain, EOS, Solana or other high-TPS L1 chains. The concept of users verifying transactions don't even exist for these chains.

As a side note, Ethereum will make more such trade-offs going forward with weak subjectivity, sharding, statelessness, state expiry etc. Purists will cry foul, and that's fine - there'll be an audience that will gladly trade-off being able to sync from genesis given the tremendous benefits elsewhere.

# Ethereum has no fixed cap

This is true, but there are good security reasons for it. I'd add that with EIP-1559 and The Merge, it is somewhat likely ETH will hit a maximum supply of around \~120M and continue deflating or stabilising from there.

# Ethereum's monetary policy is unreliable

This is also partially true. While many exaggerate, it is true that Ethereum has seen 2 cuts in block rewards, and these were made by social consensus rather than code. EIP-1559 and The Merge completely overhaul Ethereum's monetary policy. But yes, until EIP-1559 and The Merge prove themselves on mainnet without further changes over several years, this remains a valid criticism. Bitcoin remains the standard for predictable and reliable monetary supply - though it does trade-off with a security risk in the future.

# Ethereum 2.0 is years away

There are a lot of misconceptions about ""Ethereum 2.0"", though the Ethereum researchers an developers are largely to blame for confusing communications. Firstly, we don't even call it that anymore. Anyway, this just refers to a series of upgrades. The first upgrade, beacon chain, went live in Dec 2020, The Merge is actively being developed (the second devnet is going live today) and scheduled to release by late 2021. Next comes data sharding. Another misconception is these upgrades will lead to low gas fees - definitely not on L1. What data sharding will do is accelerate rollups. A much greater impact to L1 will be statelessness+state expiry, plus sharding execution if it's ever required. (The jury's now out on that one...)

# Ethereum has no intrinsic value, it's all created from thin air

Ethereum is a global, decentralized SaaS platform and collects revenues in transaction fees. These transaction fees are now substantial - over $1 billion per month. Indeed, yesterday, Ethereum generated $117M ([cryptofees.info](https://cryptofees.info)), which is $43B annualized. This would put Ethereum as #2 compared to the largest corporations in the world. I don't think this sort of activity is sustainable for now, but it shows you that it's possible, and gives you a glimpse into the future.

With EIP-1559 releasing in July, a majority of these transaction fees will be burned, directly accruing value to all ETH stakeholders. Following The Merge, the remaining non-burned fees (tips) will be returned to stakers, in addition to the yield they generate.

Not only is Ethereum one of the most productive assets in the world, it also has the most advanced accrual mechanisms.

# It is too difficult to stake ETH

This is definitely valid, 32 ETH is a lot of money. However, I think there's a significant misconception about what staking is. On many of the delegated-type chains, when you're ""staking"" what you're actually doing is just delegating to someone else. Some newer models like Algorand randomizes this process, but you're still delegating, rather than validating. You're effectively being given free money for not really doing anything. Early delegated-type systems like BitShares or EOS never paid delegators, so the validators ended up bribing delegators. The new delegated-type systems simply ""pre-bribe"" delegators. Of course, validators can still bribe delegators from their rewards, but that's a separate discussion.

In Ethereum beacon chain, you are validating your own ETH, and thus earning staking fees for providing a service to the network.

Those that just want to stake and don't care about these technicalities, beacon chain is just the base layer, and we have multiple staking services being built on top of it, with various levels of decentralization. These staking services let you earn staking rewards for small amounts of ETH. See the full list here:  [Ethereum 2.0 Beacon Chain (Phase 0) Block Chain Explorer - Ethereum 2.0 Staking Services Overview - beaconcha.in - 2021](https://beaconcha.in/stakingServices)

# Ethereum never executes upgrades on time and constantly change their plans (u/I_haven-t_reddit)

Does Ethereum constantly change their plans? Yeah, that's definitely true. But it's simply pragmatic. This industry is innovating rapidly, and when you have exponential advancements, it doesn't make any sense to just stick to old tech. Abandoning the hybrid PoW/PoS makes sense, even if it means you lose out a year or so of research. Going for a rollup-centric roadmap makes sense, simply because it'll deliver massive scalability sooner than anyone imagined. Upgrades are definitely being executed - the beacon chain went live in Dec 2020, EIP-1559 happens in two months' time, and The Merge goes less than 6 months after that.

A perfect counter case would be Cardano, which is basically obsolete 2015-era tech. DPoS, single-ledger, relying on state channels and sidechains for scalability. By rejecting significant advancements like signature aggregation, sharding and rollups, they are destined to be stuck in the past. OK, maybe that's a poor example because despite being obsolete they still can't execute. Seriously, though, the actual counter case is, of course, Bitcoin. And that's just fine - a model like that makes sense for something that just wants to be money and nothing else.

# Proof-of-stake increases centralization by concentrating wealth (u/epic_trader, u/Mathje, u/sn00fy)

While this seems to make sense at first glance, there are many nuances to this:

\- Ethereum has had the benefit of 6+ years of proof-of-work, and we've seen significant token distribution in that time. Now, the distribution is relatively decentralized and second only to Bitcoin.

\- Validators and (non-validating) stakers have costs too. While hardware costs are significantly lower, there'll be taxes and overheads which will be redistributed.

\- The biggest factor often overlooked is that proof-of-stake has very, very low issuance. When The Merge happens, issuance will be \~0.5%. A validator cap is being proposed which will also subsequently cap issuance at only 0.8% or so.

Proof-of-work may still have better redistribution characteristics, but it's marginal at best. Not to mention mining has become highly industrialized and centralized.

# Even if companies adopt Ethereum they will just run a private chain (u/sn00fy)

Not just companies, but we're going to see private chains being run for consumers. We are already seeing some of this with Binance Smart Chain, but in the future, I'd speculate have big players like governments, banks, and corporations run private chains.

Naturally, there'll also be business adoption for the public chain with B2B activities.

Like I alluded to at the very beginning, only a very limited amount of gas will be consumed on the Ethereum L1 chain long term. But that doesn't matter - L1 will be 100% saturated at all times, and other solutions building with Ethereum only adds to its network and Lindy effects.

# Ethereum has old tech, new chains have newer tech (u/Mathje)

Of all the misinformation and FUD that pervades this space, this is the one that grinds my gears the most. Ethereum has always been at the bleeding edge of innovation, and continues to be. While there are certainly innovative projects in the space, absolutely nothing is even attempting to solve the big problems: the blockchain trilemma. Consider this: every other smart contract chain uses some form of delegated-type consensus mechanism, many with a hard cap on number of validators. Cosmos: 300 (currently 150); Polkadot: 1,000; Binance Smart Chain/EOS: 21. The ones that end up with more validators have to compromise on scalability.

Beacon chain uses revolutionary new techniques like weak subjectivity and signature aggregation to enable massive decentralization with up to a million validators. There are 135,000 validators live already despite being none more than an incentivized testnet, with thousands being added every week. Not to mention, beacon chain validators are not required to be online 24x7 like the other chains.

Or, consider this: these L1 chains can offer more throughput than Ethereum's \~55 TPS for ETH transfers, or \~20 TPS overall, sure. But Ethereum is empowering rollups with data sharding to scale to 100,000 TPS and beyond, with groundbreaking new tech (data availability sampling) securing it all without compromising decentralization. No L1 will ever scale to these levels, even after absolutely giving up on decentralization. Not even considering hybrid solutions like zkPorter or Validium.

Or, consider this: the most innovative chains are actually rollups. Just look at the phenomenal work being done by StarkNet. There's a good reason they are becoming rollups on Ethereum and not anywhere else - it has the best consensus mechanism in the industry.

Or, consider this: Pretty much every innovative new smart contract is released on Ethereum, and then copy-pasted to other chains.

In short, the Ethereum ecosystem has far and away the most cutting-edge tech in the industry.

# There is no real use case for Ethereum. It's only used by degens for gambling and exchanging other tokens that are just as useless. (u/sn00fy)

Degens are paying transaction fees just like everyone else - the whole point of credible neutrality and permissionless means Ethereum does not discriminate what people use the chain for.

That said, it is certainly concerning that a lot of activity on Ethereum seems to be speculative. This is, of course, true of all early tech. We're definitely seeing real adoption from big players as well - I don't need to repeat all the news about Visa, EIB bonds, etc. A lot of work needs to be done to onboard more of these non-degen usecases.

# Rollups are centralized

It's true that some of the early rollups have centralized sequencers. This is not a security risk, though, as fraud or validity proofs will ensure the same security as Ethereum mainnet. There is a liveness and censorship risk, and centralized sequencers are definitely not trustless systems. Fortunately, most rollups have decentralized sequencers in their roadmaps, so this is not going to be an issue for long.

# Rollup-centric roadmap breaks composability ([epic\_trader](https://www.reddit.com/user/epic_trader/))

Yes, and no. Within rollups, everything will be composable, but between rollups/L1 nominally they do break composability. Fortunately, there are multiple projects hard at work to solve this, with relatively seamless L2<>L2 interoperability. It's still a work-in-progress, of course, but this is more of an engineering problem that is currently being solved than a theoretical hurdle.

# Bonus: Ethereum is a frankenstein monster with two chains, two assets, ETH1 and ETH2

No, there's only one ETH. While there are two chains that run in parallel right now, think of beacon chain as an incentivized testnet to ensure the brand new consensus mechanism works well. These chains will be merged in the next 9 months and it'll all be one Ethereum again.",700.0,2021-05-12 08:23:53,0.98
The Ethereum network approaches a market cap of $500 billion. But have we *earned* it?,"I don't usually discuss price, but here's a good opportunity. The network is on track to settle over $1 trillion in May 2021 and generate $1 billion in transaction fee revenues. In less than 10 weeks, at least 75% of that will be burned - an arguably better incentive mechanism than dividends or stock buybacks, and later in the year issuance will plummet to at most 0.8%. $83B locked in DeFi. $17B locked and providing economic security on the beacon chain. Assuming no further growth, but looking into key future economic upgrades EIP-1559 and The Merge, I'd guesstimate a P/E ratio of no greater than 50.

I'd say we're several orders of magnitude ahead of 2017, but $500B is a large number and we're barely just about earning it, at this time. So how overvalued can ETH price be? Please note that the following estimations are partially subjective, based on P/E ratios. There are obviously many other dynamics at play, so this is a flawed comparison, but it's better than hot air hopium. Let's compare it to other assets:

If the Ethereum network was as overvalued \_\_\_\_\_\_ as what would ETH price be?

Apple: $3,000

Microsoft: $3,300

Tesla: $80,000

Bitcoin: $30,000

BS Chain: $215,000

Polkadot: $2.7M

Cardano: $1.86M

Obviously, 99.9% of crypto assets are grotesquely overvalued, and this is a very, very poor yardstick for comparison. Interestingly, some DeFi protocols today remain undervalued relative to mature equities like Apple or Microsoft, but that's for another time.

In conclusion, I believe Ethereum is no longer undervalued. It's more or less valued at par at $500 billion given current levels of activity, assuming said activity is sustained and EIP-1559 and The Merge are delivered as anticipated. However, there's significant room for growth, but the ecosystem has to execute immaculately on scalability but more importantly UX.

Conversely, risk factors remain. There has to be adequate demand for the additional scalability, otherwise revenues can drop despite there being greater activity (i.e. demand/supply equilibrium for the fee market skews towards oversupply with blocks no longer being full.). A lot of said activity today is speculative in nature (it's hard to quantify how much - perhaps for another post) and can easily evaporate if sentiment turns. We saw this in 2017/18, where we went from high congestion to blocks were no longer being full very quickly. As hinted above, blocks being partially full means transaction fees can tank hard, and significantly reducing the fundamental value of the network. The opportunity at hand is thus to onboard significant lasting value from traditional finance before any of that happens.

Lastly, as demonstrated above, speculative manias can mean ETH price can head much, much higher than it's fundamentally worth. A 90% bear market is very much still on the cards if that happens, and one we must be prepared for. Most tech companies plummeted by 90%+ following the dotcom bubble - I'd remind you it's some of the same class of growth institutional and retail investors now getting involved with ETH. Like with the dotcom bubble, a likely outcome can be investors get far too ahead of themselves and start pricing ETH like it's a significant part of the global financial infrastructure - whereas in reality that scenario is probably a decade or two away. Remember to look out for insane overvaluations in the coming months/years, and needless to say, it'll be a bumpy ride along the way. But at this time, at $4,000, we've earned it.

Addendum: I just wanted to clarify by stating the obvious. Obviously, ETH is a multifarious asset with muiltiple use cases which will express themselves over the long term. I'm just evaluating a base scenario from a value generation perspective most institutional investors will be comfortable with. ",261.0,2021-05-10 04:09:31,0.95
"Real talk on why you are still super early, and how even $10k ETH is nothing","EDIT May 2022: since a few people put a reminder on this post and I just got a notification - Unfortunately it is my belief that the unfolding global equities crisis and the Ukraine war ended our 2021 bull cycle early. All of the fundamentals in this post are still true! It is my firm belief that ETH will surpass $15k in this next bull leg, and likely go far higher. Stay strong and HODL!

Initial post from Summer 2021 is below:

I feel the need to dump some of my thoughts. It's apparent that lot of ETH investors don't understand what they own, and are just acting based on speculation of market cycles. By the end of this post I hope to help a few of you know a little more about what you own (or what you are thinking about owning) and why the current bull market is just a cherry on top of something much larger.

Here are a truckload of hugely positive things that *have not yet altered* the price of ETH*:*

* [EIP 1559](https://notes.ethereum.org/@vbuterin/eip-1559-faq), **THIS UPCOMING SUMMER:**
   * Slashes mining profits and therefore cuts new ETH entering the economy. Miners are the most consistent sellers of ETH. Less new ETH entering the market means less ETH available to buy. This means the cost of ETH goes up significantly relative to current prices.
   * Fee burning - destroying a portion of the ETH used in transaction fees. ETH actively leaving the market means even less ETH available to buy. ETH goes up even more.
   * Both of these effects will take months to ripple through the exchanges, but their effects will be huge. Look at the regular [Bitcoin Halving](https://www.investopedia.com/bitcoin-halving-4843769) event for reference, and be patient. Supply/demand shifts take months to hit prices.
* [The Merge](https://ethmerge.com/), **THIS UPCOMING WINTER**:
   * Mining ETH will be a thing of the past. Instead, all new ETH will be given to wallets that stake the ETH they already own. Basically, for putting the ETH you hold into a staking pool, you will be given more ETH at a rate of about 7% of what you own per year. That's a really generous interest rate, making ETH a competitive investment for the wealthy *even if the price of ETH stagnates.*
   * BUT - this will happen while ETH also continues to grow in value. Your existing ETH goes up, and owning ETH also gives you more ETH. In fact, this will be the *only way* new ETH is minted from then on. This is a *massive* incentive to sit on a pile of ETH, and only sell what you need to pay bills. Again, less selling means more expensive ETH.
   * This will also take months to ripple through exchanges as it's a supply/demand shift. Be patient.
* [Sharding](https://ethereum.org/en/eth2/shard-chains/) in **2022/23:**
   * This is a big one because a lot of seasoned crypto traders expect a bear market to start in 2022. I do too, but 2022 will be the year that Ethereum's adoption as technology takes off in a real way. With the implementation of sharding, and [eWASM](https://medium.com/chainsafe-systems/ethereum-2-0-a-complete-guide-ewasm-394cac756baf), Ethereum is going to change the world. That doesn't mean the bear market won't hit us, but it means one of two things: either the bear market's impact on ETH will be dramatically reduced, *or*, we're about to experience the buying opportunity of a lifetime before ETH goes wildly parabolic at the end of the bear market.
   * When ETH 2.0 is fully deployed, the network will have gone from processing just over a dozen transactions per second (as it does today), to about 100,000. A speed increase of 10,000x, and an equivalent gas fee reduction. I'll let you decide whether or not you think that will make more developers, governments, institutions, and even just regular people want to use the Ethereum network.
* Public opinion and knowledge:
   * [**The flippening**](https://www.blockchaincenter.net/flippening/) **is coming. It's not an if. It's a when.** It may literally even be this year. When this happens the average joe news media is going to erupt. Public opinion will shift. Ethereum will be a household name. In a few years, family will be *approaching you* to ask about staking ETH, instead of you just talking their ears off about how you've doubled your net worth in a single month.
   * **Look at that graph in the flippening link -** The flip was on its way to happening before the crypto crash. ETH 2.0 is coming. This is not a question of ""if"". I don't know how anyone can look at that graph in the context of ETH 2.0 and deny that the flippening is coming very soon.
* Tech adoption:
   * NFTs are going to be an enormous part of the future. Everything about the technology just makes sense and solves so many problems. We will see house deeds, permits, digital assets, bonds, video game property, wills, maybe even voting systems... all take place on-chain. Many of these will be *side chains running on Ethereum*. NFTs also allow something really cool - physical and digital assets tying together. Imagine buying a concert ticket and later receiving an NFT of the band taking a crowd-facing selfie *at that concert*. Incredibly cool stuff. This is the future we are about to live in, and *very* soon.
   * After the ETH 2.0 merge, the Ethereum network will be world-changing technology, in fact, it is getting there already and we've not even taken off yet. People who aren't familiar with terms like ""L2 scaling"" and ""settlement layer"" won't be able to follow, but you'll have to believe the nerdy folks. This is big. Bigger than big. This will be the quiet superhighway beneath the world, and the profits it generates will go directly to those staking and hodling their ETH... that's *you.*

All of the coming benefits above are multiplicative with one another.

Multiplicative benefits are what cause parabolic growth.

**Some of my fun predictions as of 5/9/21:**

* Bitcoin is about to go on a tear. I expect over the next 12 months it will run up over 300%, and it may leave 5 digits for the last time. It will outperform ETH for a short period, but ETH will still dramatically outperform it over the next 12 months overall.
* Sometime in the next few weeks ETH will see a significant but temporary pullback or an extended stagnation. We really need to shake out some paper hands. My guess is that this happens between $4000 and $6000.
* By January 1st 2026, Eth will be targeting or surpassing $50,000. I'm making this claim assuming no catastrophic USD inflation. To make the point, I will also claim it will hit 12x its current value (as of 5/9/2021) relative to every fiat currency.
* By 2025 you will be able to use a wallet containing either [gwei](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/gwei-ethereum.asp) or [satoshis](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/satoshi.asp) to purchase almost *anything* that you can purchase with a debit card in 2021. Your house and car deeds will exist on a blockchain if you so desire. You will personally own NFTs, even if you currently think they are silly.

To conclude, it is my belief that the $10K ETH claim is made based on market cycle analysis alone. It doesn't even consider ETH 2.0, technology adoption, deflationary indicators, or market actualization. $10K is a joke, $10k will happen below the flippening. I believe those that permanently leave ETH at $10k will be haunted by that decision for the rest of their lives.

How many times have you heard ""is that another Bitcoin? I don't get involved in that crypto stuff."" The people saying this to you today will be putting ETH in their IRAs and 401Ks in a few years. You are not just early, you are *insanely* early. **Nobody outside the crypto community even knows what Ethereum is. Let me repeat that -** ***Ethereum is worth $400 billion, and the vast majority of all investors still don't even know what it is.***

$5K is a great price. $10k is a great price.

MATIC/Polygon Transactions Continue to Rise at an Exponential Rate; Expect this continue to accelerate as ETH activity increases and Merge is Prioritized Over Sharding,"In the Ethereum ecosystem, MATIC/Polygon operates to provide scalability and cross chain communications. Competitors, which operate either via plasma, state channels, Truebit or rollups, include: Groundhog, OpenFinance, Sablier, StablePay, zkSync, Celer, OMG network, xDai Stake, Request, NEufund, Polymath, Securitize and Connext.

Of these, the MATIC/Polygon network is by far the most well-known and high transacted service on the Ethereum blockchain. It has a validator layer that is highly incentivized to make sure things work as intended. Polygon aims at creating an ecosystem that makes it easy to connect multiple different scaling solutions – everything from sidechains with different consensus mechanisms to Layer 2 options such as Plasma, Optimistic Rollups and ZK rollups.

It is clear that Matic’s ethos is scaling. In the coming iterations of the MATIC/Polygon network, we can look forward to optimistic rolls ups and zk Roll-ups. From March to May, the number of transactions on the Polygon network increased by a factor of 10. Daily volume is increasing as well at an expodential rate as demonstrated by the most recent blockchain data from the MATIC explorer.

The rapidly increasing transaction count on MATIC/Polygon suggests that its use in level 2 scaling, most specifically for defi applications, is accelerating. As growth continues on the Ethereum block chain, increased transactions are going to bog down the network without the aid of Level 2 scaling solutions like MATIC/Polygon.

The current price of MATIC/Polygon is in consolidation. It peaked to 94c recently and has now been trading sideways. As further evidence of growth on the network, I’ve been following the daily transaction history of the blockchain on the MATIC explorer.

The most recent ETH developer meeting has prioritized merge over sharding. Given this, the need for level 2 scaling solutions is absolutely essential. The rise of defi has put excessive strain on the Ethereum network, and until sharding can be implemented (likely Q3/4 2022), scalability solutions like MATIC will be essential to growth of the blockchain.

TLDR - The Fundamentals of ETH in 2021,"Here are some of the Fundamentals of ETH for those who maybe new and see comments saying “it’s easy to hodl when you understand the fundamentals of ETH”. 

• Ethereum is the blockchain that has the most developers using it’s smart contracts and blockchain. 

• High fees demonstrates the huge demand and therefore scarcity of Ethereum block space. 

• EIP1559 will introduce more predictable fees and will allow users to not have to “outbid” each other for block space. Thus limiting the amount of wasted ETH on gas. 

• EIP1559 brings in fee burning which may reduce the amount of ETH in circulation. 

• Proof of Work to Proof of Stake merge will make Ethereum much more environmentally friendly and reduce the amount of electricity required to validate transactions. It will also require less hardware cost to become a validator. Making Staking much more accessible to the wider community. 

• Proof of Stake will make Ethereum the most decentralised blockchain as more people will opt into become a validator. There is currently 4 million ETH locked into the beacon chain. 

• Sharding as part of the ETH 2.0 upgrade will increase transactions per second by a factor of 64. There will be 64 Ethereum chains running in parallel with each other. 

• ETH may come deflationary. One of the biggest “flaws” that people currently slander Ethereum for is the fact that inflation is about 4% per year and that there is an infinite supply of ETH. With ETH 2.0 and EIP1559, there may be a deflationary supply. 

• ETH deflationary? Well, validators of the blockchain will be staking 32 ETH each. There is likely to be ~25% apy after the merge for validators. They are earning ~8% apy now. This is before they get fee bomuses which are currently being paid to miners. This will attract many more validators. There are already 4 million ETH locked up, not freely available to the market. Add on top of this the fee burning from EIP1559 and all the ETH locked in DeFi then you are left with a hugely reduced supply of ETH on the free market. This will make it a very scarce asset. Scarcity leads to demand which leads to a higher premium on the under lying asset. 

• Worlds first Triple Point Asset. ETH could easily become a store of value in the long term. ETH as a bond. Stakers of ETH will be paid dividends in ETH for validating transactions on the network. ETH is a commodity. A small (at the moment quite large) amount of ETH is required to make a transaction on the main chain. 

• Layer 2 scaling solutions. We now have Polygon leading the way for scaling Ethereum. Allowing the same benefits of the Ethereum blockchain but in a way that highly reduces gas fees. There are many more to come over the next few months including; ZKrollups, Optimistic roll ups and other side chains. 

• The huge number of transactions being settled on ETH.

• Mainstream adoption of the network (eg. Visa settlement and European Investment Bank bond issue).

• Total value locked in ETH I’m DeFi/smart contracts and NFTs. The existing value is unlikely to move and network effect attracts more value/transactions.

Ethereum 2.0 Progresses As Developers Launches Super Experimental Testnet,"Ethereum software developers just launched “a super experimental Eth1-Eth2 post-merge testnetwork” as part of the ETH Global Scaling Hackathon project called Rayonism. The testnet is called Steklo, targeted at executing and finalizing transactions. Steklo will test the Rayonism approach which will merge two systems: transactions would happen on the current network while consensus, or confirmation of transactions would happen on Ethereum 2.0.

What if: total daily transaction fees (in ETH) have already peaked,"My post keeps getting removed, so I'll have to post this without any links. I'll add all the links in a comment down below. 

Firstly, I'd highly recommend watching the fantastic Bankless episode with Justin Drake. <link removed> [1] A must watch for any ETH investor.

Here's some incoherent brainstorming that there's a possibility that total transaction fees collected by the network in ETH terms terms has already peaked.

It's all about demand and supply. Over the last 5 years, we have seen exponential growth in demand for the Ethereum network. In 2015, the network had a few thousand daily active users. That number now stands at over 600,000. Of course, the demand is for gas, and particularly since the advent of gas-hungry DeFi protocols in summer 2020, there's been an overwhelming increase in demand. Meanwhile, the network's supply - gas limit - has gone up by only 5x since genesis. <link removed> [2]

The end result is skyrocketing gas prices, and thus, daily EVM fees collected, as the network's demand has vastly outstripped supply. There's no way to quantify the unsatisfied demand, but we have some clues. We have seen BS Chain flip Ethereum in terms of daily active users and gas consumed - highlighting the overwhelming demand for EVM blockspace.

While Ethereum has been supply constrained throughout its history, we are now entering a new paradigm where this will no longer be the case. We have at least 4 prominent programmable rollups releasing over the summer, hinting at two orders of magnitude more supply than ever before. This will further accelerate with data sharding giving us another order of magnitude. Add in statelessness and other EVM improvements, and you have possibly another order of magnitude. Compared to a supply increase of only 5x in 5 years, we're all set to see a 2,000x-10,000x increase over the next 2-3 years. It's important to note that it doesn't matter who satisfies demand for EVM gas - whether it be L1, rollups or sidechains, differing fractions of gas will be consumed by L1. We've seen how elastic this market is - a modest 20% bump in gas limit has seen a greater decline in total transaction fees. Obviously other factors are involved, but it could be as high as 50%.

In the end, the equation is pretty simply - do we think that demand for EVM gas is going to grow by more than 2,000x in the next couple of years to keep up with the 2,000x expansion in supply? That's a tough question, but there's a real possibility that for the first time in Ethereum's history, supply will grow faster than demand.

Here's another data point:

In an earlier post, I had estimated an inflation rate of -3% post-1559/Merge, with an optimistic -3.8% target <link removed>[3]. This is right in line with Justin's ""lean optimistic"" estimation of -3.9% <link removed>[4]. However, let's consider a more conservative scenario.

Here's my totally baseless speculation: I doubt an extreme deflation of -3.9% is sustainable in a world of positive inflation, as ETH price will keep increasing till gas is too expensive in fiat terms, and demand starts to drop off. This leads me to believe that the network will find an equilibrium around a lower rate. Perhaps 0% to -1% may prove sustainable? This implies that the long-term total daily EVM fees will be lower than the \~15K we saw in Q1 2021, but more likely to be under \~10K ETH.

All that said, I don't think there's a negative outcome here. A long-term economy (going with Justin's ""lean conservative"" estimate) with \~5K ETH burned daily with a sustained -0.7% deflation sounds great to me, with ETH price is well into the five figures. Doesn't really matter if we'll look back to Q1 2021 as the time with peak ETH fees or potential deflation.",57.0,2021-04-29 09:19:43,0.94
A period is approaching soon where Ethereum is guaranteed to have negative sellable issuance.," One stream of Ethereum's upgrades are coming in this order:

1. Fee burning beginning mid July
2. PoW replaced with PoS \~ end of this year
3. Merge cleanup where validators can withdraw their rewards and stake \~ some time in 2022

So between stages 2 and 3 ether will be being destroyed due to fee burning, and mining and the associated sell pressure will have ended. There will still be issuance paid to ensure security but it will be paid to validators who can't withdraw it, and it will be much smaller as PoS has much smaller costs. During this same period more ether will be locked up in validators as the rewards will jump, all of the tips and MEV which was formerly going to miners will suddenly go to validators instead.

We know the huge impact issuance has from bitcoin halvenings, but even infinite halvenings can't describe the equivalent to this period. Issuance isn't going to zero, it's going negative in terms of what can reach markets. No one knows how long it will last but based on previous Ethereum upgrade periods 6 months seems like a reasonable guess. And after that new issuance will still be several halvenings less than it is now, possibly remaining negative long term if fees burning exceeds issuance.",24.0,2021-04-29 00:34:09,0.93
"Ethereum is making a nice run right now but just wait until ""the cliffening"", ethereum's own halvening event just like what triggers bitcoin's explosive growth in value. Up to 90% reduction in ethereum issuance!","""The Cliffening"" is the community name given to the large drop in ETH issuance that will occur once ""The Merge"" occurs and Ethereum is fully upgraded to the proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus algorithm. “The Cliffening” is a play on the popular Bitcoin phrase, “The Halvening”. While Bitcoin halves its issuance rate every 4 years, Ethereum will see its issuance rate reduced by roughly 90% at the time of ""The Merge"". **That's equivalent to *3 Bitcoin ""Halvenings"" happening at once!** Ethereum will experience an issuance reduction in an instant what will take an additional 12 years to be matched on Bitcoin's network.""

"This seems only fair: ""ETH is completely usable right now!""","We've had a lot of people here repeatedly posting on how ETH was unusable during the high usage peaks (ETH has increased its daily tps from 1mil transactions last years to over 1.5mil transactions nowadays).


I'm not sure if those posts came from users holding so called ""ETH killers"" in the hope to push a narrative here but the ETH core devs reacted fast and implemented some improvements:


-  Optimisation of gas usage in the Berlin hardfork

-  Extra security due to the Berlin hardfork has enabled Ethereum to raise gas block limits by 20%.


This results in the lowest fees today that has been seen in several months, more than 10x lower than last week. And the important part that needs to be stressed is that these aren't even the real scaling solutions.
The rollups will come in the next months, EIP1559 is coming in July.

Why I will remain super bullish on ETH even in the eventual bear market. Here's why it could just out-perform every other crypto:,"I have been pondering this for the last few weeks and I’m starting to wonder if we will even see much of a bear market at all this time around. Now don’t get me wrong, I’m not talking about some “super cycle” BS which BTC maxis like to talk about, I’m talking about ETH only dropping 50% in this bear market and recovering much much quicker compared to BTC’s 60-70% and shitcoins’ >90% drops and multi-year recovery. I don’t believe the super cycle theory as it goes against human nature and emotional hype cycles. Humans like to fomo in and they like to panic sell. There’s no escaping that and I doubt there is any escaping the enormous downwards pressure from miners in the second half of Bitcoin’s 4 year halving cycles as miners need to pay electricity bills which they do by selling newly mined Bitcoin… or is there? Maybe we can escape the constant selling pressure from miners. Well, not for BTC of course, but for Ethereum.

As many of you will be aware, there are two main upgrades coming for Ethereum in the near future. First, we have EIP-1559, the fee market change which will reduce fee volatility, make for a much better user experience, reduce miners’ incomes by about 30-40% (less selling pressure!) and best of all, lead to possibly millions of ETH in the form of gas fees (specifically the base fee) being burned each year. Secondly, we have the ETH 1.0 —> ETH 2.0 merge where the consensus mechanism moves from Proof of Work to Proof of Stake. Alongside increasing energy efficiency by over 99.9% (great for the 🌍 and even better for public perception and marketing!) and improving security by multiple times, it will also lead to a reduction in ETH issuance, colloquially known as “the cliffening”. ETH issuance will drop from about 4-5% per year which is mostly sold on the open market by miners to less than 1% ***and that 1% annual inflation is before we consider ETH burned by EIP-1559!*** Oh, but it doesn’t end there, ***that 1% issuance is locked up in staking nodes and cannot be sold until sharding comes in a couple of years.***

Let that sink in for a second.

The whole mechanism which causes Bitcoin to pump so hard every four years, the halvening has ***NOTHING*** on this supply shortage which is building.

Bitcoin pumps more than 10x because issuance dropped from 3.5% to 1.7%. What is ETH going to do when we totally remove all constant selling pressure by dropping issuance from 4-5% to 0% and as if that wasn’t enough we slap on an ETH supply sink called EIP-1559 just for good measure. This is literally a perfect storm. Such bullish supply and demand dynamics have never existed before in human history.

So before I wrap this up, let’s see how this all fits into our timeline. EIP-1559 is [set to go live on July the 14th](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ethereum-eip-1559-fee-market-154032902.html) with the London hard fork. Based on my [other post](https://old.reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/myq125/daily_general_discussion_april_26_2021/gvwv709/) discussing where I suspect we may be in the cycle, this could coincide with or be the launch ramp we need to go parabolic at the peak of this bull run which I think will end between August and December of this year. As for the cliffening, [the devs have been discussing the possibility of pushing this through as early as the end of 2021 but more likely early 2022](https://ethmerge.com/?q=why-is-ethereum-switching-to-proof-of-stake-pos#), right in the early bear market. By this point, the only sellers left will be weak hands. No more automatic selling from miners which historically is one of if not the the main factor in the bear market after the initial wave of whales taking profits and capitulation of weak hands in the first month or two. Meanwhile, other chains will still have positive inflation rates instead of net negative issuance. This is why once I have taken profits on 60% of my stack at the peak of this bull run the only thing I intend to hold onto is ETH (I’m doing taking profits to diversify out of crypto a little like a responsible human with 30% of my stack and to buy the bear market dip with the other 30%). The remaining 40% is a forever HODL stack). No BTC. Not shitcoins. Only ETH, some profits taken into real world assets and a big stack of stablecoins in DeFi waiting to buy back some cheap ETH just before the cliffening hype kicks off.

In conclusion, I hope that [my friendship with u/CosmicCollusion](https://old.reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/mp773l/daily_general_discussion_april_12_2021/gu95n99/) has been re-instated and I hope you’re all strapped into the ETH rocketship more than any of the other ones by the time this bear market rears its ugly head.

Opinion: Rollups are 4th gen blockchains,"I'm sure we've seen the memes about ""3rd gen blockchains"". Let me present a thesis that said 3rd gen blockchains are superseded by rollups.

For a deep dive into rollups, I'd highly recommend reading:  [An Incomplete Guide to Rollups (vitalik.ca)](https://vitalik.ca/general/2021/01/05/rollup.html)

But I'll attempt to offer a more digestible if less technically accurate overview of rollups - I know there are plenty of oversimplifications here that can be nitpicked, but I believe this is the best way to get the message across. I think too many people are sleeping on the revolutionary nature of rollups and I'll try to explain why this is where most blockchain activity will live in the near and distant future.

First, let's break down smart contract blockchains. Broadly speaking, they have:

1. Execution layer: This is where the VM lives and transactions are processed.
2. Data layer: This is where block data is stored for posterity.
3. Consensus layer: This is where the blockchain comes to consensus.

Today, all blockchains have to do all three, and that can lead to significant inefficiencies. For example, Ethereum and Bitcoin have strong consensus layers several orders of magnitude more decentralized and secure than any other blockchain. However, their execution and data layers are also strongly bottlenecked by the consensus layer, thus leading to very limited throughput. Conversely, a blockchain like EOS, BSC and Solana have very strong execution and data layers and offer high TPS, but to achieve this they have very weak consensus layers that'll always tend towards centralization. There are, of course, differing compromises to the trilemma for different blockchains - it's a spectrum. But only Bitcoin and Ethereum lie towards the extreme end of massive decentralization and high security.

What if a blockchain could split up duties and get the best of all worlds? This is where rollups are revolutionary. Think of rollups as a new type of blockchain which divides up work leveraging the strengths of two (or more) different chains. A rollup has its own execution layer to process high TPS, uses the consensus layer of a different chain with a strong consensus layer, and splits up data layer between itself and the different chain. The net result is for the first time ever we get a blockchain experience with high TPS but is also complemented by high security and decentralization. You know how Apple designs their products but contracts manufacturing to Foxconn because they simply do it better and cheaper? Likewise, rollups do what they do best - fast execution layers; while contracting a portion of data and all of consensus to a different chain that does it better than they ever could.

Currently, Ethereum offers by far the most secure and decentralized consensus layer that can support this construction, and once The Merge goes live later this year, things will get even more interesting. Currently, beacon chain has 120,000 validators already, and we'll surely see something like 500,000 validators post-Merge when it drives the Ethereum execution layer. This is in stark contrast to other high TPS chains which restrict their validators to a few thousand at most - two orders of magnitude difference, while some go as low as a few dozen. This is why all rollups are currently live on Ethereum, at least until a blockchain offers a better consensus layer. Currently, Ethereum has a limited data layer, but with data sharding coming after The Merge, it will also have the best data layer in the industry - offering 1.3 MB/s - thus becoming the de-facto standard home for rollups. Please note that we have multiple rollups live on Ethereum currently: zkSync, dYdX, Loopring, ImmutableX\*, DeversiFi, Optimism (albeit whitelisted to Synthetix) etc.  - all offering thousands of TPS with gas fees so low that they are subsidized by most of these rollups to be effectively zero gas for the end user.

How about some numbers? Currently, the L1 Ethereum chain does 55 TPS for ETH transfers, but much less for complex smart contracts, for an average of about 17-20 TPS. With rollups, we're seeing anywhere between 1,000 to 5,000 TPS. With data sharding, we'll see this increase to 25,000 to 100,000 TPS. This is scalability far beyond any L1 can offer on its own, while at the same time not materially sacrificing decentralization and security. Of course, we could see a different L1 offer a better consensus and data layer than Ethereum, but at this time no one is even attempting it. The key projects to look out for are Optimism, Arbitrum, zkSync 2.0, StarkNet and Polygon - all plan to offer generalized, programmable rollups this summer. Worth noting that Optimism has actually been live on mainnet since January, though they take a conservative whitelisted approach and currently only have Synthetix live, with Uniswap V3 lined up next soon after the May 5th L1 deployment. There are, of course, significant differences between these rollups, but that's for another post.

So, my recommendation for alternate L1s would be to either:

1. Become an Ethereum rollup. Leverage all the benefits of your execution layer and VM, without resorting a compromised consensus layer like you currently do. This is a win-win scenario for the industry.
2. Create a better consensus layer than Ethereum: have hundreds of thousands of validators, validating in a non-delegated and permissionless manner, offer massive data availability and offering unforeseen benefits over Ethereum. Do this, and rollups will contract you instead of Ethereum to do their data and consensus work.
3. Aggressively market your chain so the technical deficiencies can be overlooked.
4. Find a niche that can't be satisfied by a rollup.

*\*While I tried to simplify things as much as possible, I think it's important to note that DeversiFi and ImmutableX are technically validium and not rollups, where the data layer is entirely off-chain instead of being split.*",272.0,2021-04-25 04:09:04,0.95
Vitalik Buterin's Thoughts on the Less Appreciated Benefits of Ethereum," This was recently posted by Vitalik (u/vbuterin) in ethereum's subreddit:

""We talk a lot about the much lower resource expenditure that PoS requires compared to PoW, and about key benefits like economic finality, but it's also worth keeping in mind some secondary benefits that the switch to PoS will bring. Most of these benefits will theoretically become available *immediately* after the merge.

* **Block time distribution**: in PoW, blocks are distributed according to a [Poisson distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poisson_distribution), so there is a high variance between the time between two blocks. On average you get one block per 13 seconds, but there are occasional intervals where there's more than 30 or even more than 60 seconds between two blocks. When you send a transaction, on average you have to wait 13 seconds for the next block to appear. In PoS, blocks appear on a regular schedule: one block per 12 seconds, and when you send a transaction, on average you have to wait 6 seconds. The only exception is skipped proposers, which are rare. Combined with EIP 1559, this will massively improve Ethereum's UX.
* **Faster pre-finality confirmation**: we talk about finality, where after \~2 epochs a block gets confirmed in such a way that it cannot feasibly be reverted. But even before then, security ramps up much more quickly than in PoW, because the LMD GHOST fork choice rule with hundreds of attestations in parallel creates much faster convergence than PoW's ""one consensus step per block"" model. After even just 12 seconds, a block already has hundreds of attesters supporting it, already making it very hard to revert.
* **Better light client protocols**: light clients for PoW ethereum [exist](https://medium.com/@rauljordan/a-primer-on-ethereum-blockchain-light-clients-f3cadde49137), but they are far less efficient than they could be, and they still require quite a bit of time and resources to turn on and maintain. The PoS light client protocol is [much more well-designed](https://github.com/ethereum/eth2.0-specs/blob/dev/specs/altair/sync-protocol.md) after learning from this experience, and requires only a minimum few kilobytes per day to stay in sync. This can make in-browser and mobile PoS light client wallets much more viable, reducing trust on centralized providers.
* **Faster ability to detect network issues**: in a PoW network, if half of nodes go offline or start acting improperly because of a bug, hack or attack, it takes some time for this to become known, because at first there's not enough information to distinguish what's going on from random chance. In a PoS network, on the other hand, you can easily see participation dropping from 99% to something much lower within a single slot, and you immediately know that something is going on.

There are also many smaller secondary benefits. The PoS switch gives us a natural opportunity to coordinate on a time when the ETH network protocol stops supporting the pre-merge chain, resetting the amount of data that clients need to download. The existing data structures in the beacon chain (particularly the historical block root and state root list) make accessing history from within the EVM much easier (the same benefit that [EIP 2935](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2935) was trying to accomplish). The SSZ structure makes history proofs of any kind much easier to implement; additionally, a more complete switch from RLP to SSZ could significantly simplify Merkle proof generation for the protocol in general.

The merge isn't just about the switch to proof of stake by itself; there's a lot more that we get along with it!""",31.0,2021-04-24 17:20:08,0.93

"Want to understand ETH2.0 in one minute? As a teacher, I wrote a primer. Why it makes me excited & bullish about ETH, and why you should be too. And no, your ETH will still be ETH!","Given the many new holders, I am writing a few short primers on important Ethereum topics.

**One of the cool new developments in the coming time, will be the switch to Ethereum 2.0.** So, in short, what's that about?

*Phase 0: Beacon chain*

This already launched, can you believe it?

In short, this is a new ""chain"". Don't let that confuse you. Basically, it is a version of the Ethereum network that runs parallel to the one we use all the time now.

It is not Proof of Work. So we don't need miners! Instead, people stake their ETH (read: lock it up) to validate the network. And they earn interest as a reward.

See my primer here:[https://www.reddit.com/r/ethtrader/comments/mxktfp/in\_time\_ethereum\_will\_move\_to\_sustainable\_green/](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethtrader/comments/mxktfp/in_time_ethereum_will_move_to_sustainable_green/)

*Phase 1: sharding*

Gas fees are high now, right? 40usd for a trade on Uniswap? Gulp!

What if we did not have on big network, but 64 smaller ones? I could work on, say, number 23, and you yourself on 56.

Then it would be less busy on those, as compared to simply one network! Or: shard.

And at the end, we combined the data from all those loose shard to one.

Put somewhat more abstractly, this phase implements shard chains, thereby increasing the transaction throughput of the network **by a factor of at least 64.**

*Phase 2: The Merge*

Sounds ominous, right? Very cool name.

Basically, in this step we do the following. We take everything that has been developed, as written about above, and we combine it with Ethereum as we know it now.

**This is also the step that will reduce the current energy needs of Ethereum by 99,9%!**

So the next time you read about how Bitcoin requires the energy of a country like Italy? Just smile and think about how superior Ethereum will be in a bit.

There will be some other changes, like cross-shard transfers, execution environments, etc., but that is stuff for another primer.

Notes on ETHGlobal's Merge Summit,"I tried posting this to r/ethereum, but the post seems to be removed or not accessible. Please feel free to repost it elsewhere, I don't require credit - I just want to see the word get out.

You can watch the full thing here: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yk39hNavhyM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yk39hNavhyM)

\- For what is arguably the most important conference for a $2 tn industry this year there was scant attendance. Most of the stream had only 100 viewers, with Vitalik's final presentation ""spiking"" to 300-500. Meanwhile, the $2 tn walled garden fruity corporation's keynote drew millions of viewers earlier in the week. We are so, so early.

\- Everyone was coy about timelines, except Tomasz (Nethermind) surprisingly let slip a target for October 2021. Reading between the lines, I speculate the target is indeed Q4 2021, but everyone's waiting to see how the Rayonism multi-client devnets play out. There's a small chance Shanghai goes before The Merge, which delays it to Q1 2022.

\- Most clients are ready for Rayonism. The code changes for the Merge is relatively simple and most clients will be done in weeks, not months. Much of the remaining work is testing, testing, auditing, and more testing. Danny expects official multi-client testnets to commence in a couple of months.

\- The ""Ethereum 2.0"" branding or ""Eth2"" nomenclature is no more, and going forward it is all just one Ethereum. The two layers are now called execution layer (formerly eth1) and consensus layer (formerly eth2). So, if you see people talk about ""Eth2"", please correct them. Bonus: harp on about false sequentiality and make Danny proud.

\- While the common perception is that the beacon chain took too long to be delivered, the actual engineering and implementation was completed in only 2 years - a remarkable achievement given it took that long for EIP-1559 (a much simpler upgrade) to make it to mainnet. Hsiao-Wei had a fascinating opening talk about how research is iterative and a lot of seemingly wasted time in 2016-18 strongly informed sound decisions for the actual implementations.

\- Client diversity is key. Vouch is a very interesting solution that builds redundancy and diversity for validators.

\- Both execution layer and consensus layer clients will continue developing in parallel after The Merge, but we may see some synergies, packaging innovations etc. Since Consensys develops clients from both layers, we may end up with a single ""Beku"" client. (I forget who made that joke - Trent? - it as a good one!)

\- While solo staking requires 32 ETH, there'll be a ton of innovation to bring various types of delegated staking with varying magnitudes of decentralization/centralization. It's imperative we get people to move away from Coinbase/Binance/Kraken and onto these more decentralized options. Personally, I'd like to see a protocol where people can run their own validators for 1 ETH or so, making it more of distributed validation rather than delegated validation. No idea how this can be done, but someone will figure it out...

\- MEV will live on after The Merge, or rather, VEV. Of course, given there are far more validators and entities involved - 120,000 versus a few dozen mining pools - we'll need new ways to organize things. But the Flashbots team are already working on it. I think we'll need a lot of coordination and ensure most validators are running VEV extraction solutions to ensure the community extracts the value and not opportunistic frontrunners.

\- Secret shared validators are live on testnet!

\- Alright, after The Merge... first we'll see cleanup fork soon after which will also enable withdrawals.

\- Next step is data sharding, which would be the significant feature focus after The Merge. Simultaneously, the execution layer teams will work on Shanghai and Cancun. Data sharding will bring 25x scale to rollups and other L2 solutions that choose to leverage the massive data availability. First we'll have committee-based consensus, with the innovative data availability sampling coming later. Speculation: I'd expect data sharding to go live by late 2022, with DAS in 2023.

\- Parallel to sharding, the key execution layer upgrade will be statelessness + state expiry. The current plan is to do them together. Post-state expiry, we'll have static expired states, which would be fairly easy to distribute - could even use IPFS or BitTorrent. There can be protocols to make the UX simple. This will be significant breakthrough for how blockchains work and will enable much higher gas limits and scaling on L1.

\- EVMX - 384-bit EVM, and other continuous improvements. Vitalik discusses the many drawbacks of WASM, and believes we can get EVMX to a point where it has most of the functionality of WASM without any of the drawbacks. RIP eWASM. My personal opinion: We'll see rapid innovation with VMs on L2 and a lot of the learnings can then be implemented back on to L1.

\- The final piece of the puzzle is SNARK-ing everything! After that, STARK-ing everything for post-quantum. This will make native execution on shards easier. Interestingly, this was the only time Vitalik even mentioned execution on shards, and ""if desired"". He's very confident about rollups. Speculation: we aren't going to see execution on shards using the prior fraud proof mechanisms ever, and we'll turn on execution only when it's done right. There'll be significant innovation around interoperability and communication between L2s, which will inform how executable shards work. Finally, CBC Casper for a more secure consensus mechanism. These upgrades are 3-5 years out. Beyond this, Ethereum L1 will achieve its final form and might go into ""maintenance mode"" middle of the decade with all of the innovation moving to L2.

There's a lot more, but these are my important takeaways.

In short, Ethereum remains the only project that's even attempting to solve the blockchain trilemma with innovative cryptographic techniques. Bitcoin has given up on scalability, while all other L1 protocols have given up on decentralization and/or security. I should note that rollups should also be considered as part of the solutions to the trilemma - especially programmable rollups like Arbitrum, Optimism, zkSync 2.0 and StarkNet. This will become evident over the next 5 years. If you watch The Merge and Scaling summits and understand that now, I believe this is what the cool kids call an ""alpha leak"". Few...

Ethereum: We Haven't Seen Anything Yet!,"While, I know it is no secret the potential that Ethereum has. It is the number two ranked cryptocurrency in-terms of market cap after all. **But I'm here to tell you that you haven't seen anything yet. This post is only related to ETH Price and ETH2 Staking, not any tech discussion, which is ofcourse ETH's strongest point! However, we all know how less of a role tech plays in a bull run.**

**But please remember, that everything in this post is mere speculation, and may not come to be.  So as always, please do your own research.**

While ETH 2.0 has famously seen delay after delay; late last year phase 0 did launch and it included one of ETH 2.0's most hyped features. The ability to stake your ETH for a passive income.

Many people probably already earn a passive income from lending out their Ethereum to places like BlockFi or Celsius. But in those situations, always remember that you are giving up the custody of your coins to those services. There is a high risk that you could lose everything. On the other hand. ETH 2.0's staking has the coins in a smart contract on the ETH blockchain. While you do have to lock them up for a certain duration of time; you do still retain custody of your coins. This is considered a much safer option than lending out your coins to a third party company.

Up until this point the interest rate has been great so far as well. Ranging from 7% to upwards of 12%. The only downside has been that if you do decide to stake your ETH into the ETH 2.0 protocol; you would have to then lock up your ETH until ETH 1.0 and 2.0 fully merge. The issue is that no one knows exactly when this will happen. It could happen three months from now. It could be 1 year from now. It could be 2 years from now. No-one knows for certain.

I recently saw an Ethereum 2.0 developer make a Twitter post about what he thinks could possibly be the initial interest rate for ETH after 2.0 has fully launched, and the changed have merged. The rates he was saying were quite high and interesting to say the least.

https://preview.redd.it/usb59vm7oku61.png?width=401&format=png&auto=webp&s=a002dc66cdd0bfe9e664c035d2cdb0b6afa5dd1a

If his prediction does come true and results in an initial 25%+ staking interest rate for Ethereum; this would change everything. First you need to take into account the ETH EIP 1559 protocol that will soon be introduced. This will result in ETH being burned in every transaction and could actually make Ethereum a deflationary coin.

But if there is anywhere near a 25% interest rate for staking, everyone will come and put there money into Ethereum.  There are other coins that have staking rates higher than that, but I wouldn't ever put any of my confidence into those coins. This is Ethereum that we are talking about here, one of the two blue chips of cryptocurrency. This could be the next great way to make a great passive income. For all of those people who were fortunate enough to accumulate 32 eth; just staking alone could be enough to grant you financial freedom in the future.

https://preview.redd.it/vvhrdudioku61.png?width=793&format=png&auto=webp&s=1a12ef6ace6f156117b802ac74dd0671f2f197cc

But look at the chart that he made. He listed that a 25% rate was his best guess of what could happen, but the rate could be even higher than that.  Of course this is just speculation, but if it would come true, it's enough to make you want to throw a lot more money into Ethereum. The developer is claiming that this interest will come from the ETH staking issuance reward, but also from transaction tips that would have normally been given to miners in the past. But since there will no longer be any mining on ETH in the future, it would then go to the stakes.

While in my opinion, if that kind of rate does exist for Ethereum; I don't think it would last very long. That incredible rate would attract everyone to stake a large amount of ETH which would probably drop that rate further. But like I said, it is very fun to think about.

So what do you think? Do you think this kind of staking rate would be possible on ETH 2.0?  Have you reached your Ethereum accumulation goals? And what is your price prediction! ",39.0,2021-04-21 18:50:47,0.88
Is the Ethereum protocol exhibiting predatory behavior? A Wednesday morning hype thread.,"


It’s 1996. Google is two years from founding. Amazon is reselling books. Video streaming is possible, if you own a 56k modem, live in a major city, are rich, and possess the technical know how to complete the several steps. President Clinton is “[B]uilding that bridge to the year two-*tha*sand.”

Good old ‘96, Tupac has been shot dead and the three largest companies listed on any US stock exchange (by market cap) are car manufacturers: GM, Ford, and Chrysler, respectively. Yeah, that’s hard to believe. 

We’ve talked about *fat protocol thesis* on this sub previously. So for those that know what it is, bear with me again while I briefly explain it for those that don’t: 

*The internet is a protocol. Value flows from its protocol to its applications. Google, Amazon, etcetera are its applications. Over time, they’ve become valuable. In cryptocurrency protocols however, value flows in the opposite direction, from the application layer to the protocol. Thus the name: fat protocol theory. Yes it’s just a theory, but so is gravity. It’s easy then, to imagine why Ethereum is uniquely positioned amongst its competition to capture so much value, because of all that’s built on it, its ecosystem. 

What’s interesting about the internet and its applications capturing value, is that we didn’t see that really begin until the late 90s. In the early-mid 90s, things were only arranging or jockeying themselves to an unknown future, so obvious to us now. And remember the ferocious competition? Anyone? That’s a book itself. Most of the companies went bankrupt, some merged, others were bought out. The ones that survived are global household names. 

It’s difficult to avoid then, comparing Ethereum and cryptocurrencies to this time period, because it’s mirroring it in lockstep. Ah the 90s. Remember its tech rockstars? Of course you do, they’re still around imposing their will in various ways. In crypto we have one living rockstar (unless Satoshi is alive): Vitalik Buterin. And that’s...not insignificant either folks, not in the culture we live in, not for Ethereum’s early days. For the younger people out there, what’s happening in crypto now is basically your chance to live, in some telling, the 90s tech boom, from which half of the top 10 wealthiest US people come:

 - Bezos
 - Gates
 - Page
 - Ellison
 - Brin

So don’t squander it watching on the sidelines. It’s still so new. Yolo in.

Let’s consider the last crypto bull cycle. Question: What crypto’s that were top ten in 2017, are top ten now? Only two: BTC and ETH (LTC is in and out of the top ten on any given week, having fallen 6 places from what was historically an unshakeable #3 position). But here’s the curious thing: if we expand that list to say the top 50, how many are ERC tokens? 33 are. The Ethereum network is starting to arrange and position itself. They [ERC tokens] now dominate the mid-tier of that list and are moving relentlessly upwards. USDC and ChainLink for example (both ERC), could break into the top ten soon. That would put three ERC tokens (ETH, LINK, USDC) in the top ten, and that is much more substantial than people think. How about visualizing the data in a different way: if we use the total crypto mkt cap which is approximately $2T, we see the entire Ethereum ecosystem makes up $500B or 25% of it. That’s more than a double percentage gain (almost triple actually) what it was in 2017. Bitcoin and Tether have a top ten relationship too. But USDC now has a mkt cap ~28% of Tether’s and gaining fast. Why is this happening? That was unthinkable just two years ago. And about BTC, the wrapped version (WBTC, an ERC token) is top 20 and moving up. That’s predatory, because the Ethereum Network is finding solutions to chew on things not natively built on it. Now, Ethereum will never eat Bitcoin anymore than Bing will eat Google (but Bing only exists because of antitrust laws), so a better analogy might be what email did to the USPS—didn’t kill it, but syphoned its small cost efficient property. I won’t even bother getting into the NFT market because it’s too nascent, but again, Ethereum is positioned to add this predatory wrinkle better than any other. Our century is young, and in these early days of crypto, unless you’re named BTC, innovation lag will kill you. 

What’s my point? My point is that like the internet and its value flow, the Ethereum protocol isn’t past 1996 yet. I don’t believe we’re seeing *fat protocol thesis* at work...not yet. And that’s a subject to ponder, because heretofore, there’s been a belief that it is. It’s important to add, that many scholars believe the thesis to be wrong and unprovable, including my economics professor. They’re right too, but only because the timeline data is too small, the thesis hasn’t had time to develop (as opposed to grow), because Amazon is still reselling books, AWS (Amazon Web Services Cloud) hasn’t democratized starting a small online business, Google doesn’t exist, ruthless competition is still killing things before they begin because the young galaxy is still full of space rocks, and global users are a small landlocked lake, not oceans yet...there’s less than 1M *active* Ethereum wallets.

My other point is that one has to wonder with trends so linear, wether holding anything besides Bitcoin, ERC, or privacy coin is worth it. I’m unconvinced, which is why I don’t. I’d also be concerned about how many potential major ETF’s are now considering structuring themselves: instead of an *Ethereum ETF* made of ETH, they’ll be made of a rotational basket of the Ethereum Network’s top tokens. Too, when some ETF’s start offering baskets of all crypto’s, how many ERC tokens do you imagine will be in there if current trends hold?


Remember the top three US companies we talked about in 1996? Well, by the early 2000’s, tech companies (what we defined earlier as internet applications) began dominating the mid-tier list of largest US companies, some making it quite high. And integrated oil-majors (Exxon, Chevron, etc) replaced the car companies as the largest by mkt cap, you know the ones selling the *gas*? No point here actually, besides the pun. 

Note: I promise I’ll try bringing this all around to make sense. So let’s continue this senseless ramble: 

After the 2008 economic crisis (which lasted some years) an unexpected group of companies staged a sudden move up the mkt cap rankings: Banks. Why? Quantitative Easing, zero percent interest rates, and loose central bank monetary policy on a global scale. It’s no coincidence that at this same time, Bitcoin came into existence. But, those damn longterm *internet applications* accruing value...

Right, so fast-forward to today. Go to your brokerage and find the top companies by market cap on any stock exchange. What are they? Bingo:

 - Apple
 - Microsoft
 - Amazon
 - Alphabet 
 - Google
 - Facebook

They’ve all finally made it. The difference is, they’re unlikely to be replaced by anything unrelated. They shouldn’t be. Not for a generation, right? Wrong. Most will be replaced from the top spots because they’ll be weakened by a DAO Web 3.0 predator that syphons, feeds, borrows, steals, learns, wraps, experiments, fails, merges, digitizes, and innovates at a pace that’s impossible to keep up with. And for good measure, add in the fact that it began as, and is unified with finance. **Its imagination will never overreach its supply of money.** On a global scale, that’s insane. At least that’s the longterm view of Ethereum. What replaces the top company’s spots is anyone’s guess. If it’s Boston Dynamics I’ll know the end is near. If it’s a green energy breakthrough I’ll have hope. 


Thanks for reading. Just wanted to try cleaning my mind this morning. Now for some fun predictions a couple years out dealing with finance bits:

 - Ethereum’s gas fees fall and staking becomes available to the masses (both promises of 2.0)

 - Hindsight data shows DeFi eroding chartered bank margins

 - Central banks are forced to combat China’s digital Yuan threat by rolling out their own digital fiat much faster than we thought

 -Bitcoin captures 50% of gold’s $10T mkt cap 

 - Fat protocol thesis is finally set loose

 - ERC tokens comprise 13 of the top 20 token spots. 

 - DeFi friction collapses and with it the learning curve

 - Country’s banks compete for global retail borrowing undercutting Ethereum’s staking rewards APY by 3% or more in some places

 - Cryptocurrency makes the platform of both major US political parties 

 - Digital fiat captures the stablecoin business and Tether collapses from their front end integration allowing the Ethereum Network (all ERC tokens combined) to make a run on Bitcoin’s mkt cap

 - Volatility continues to dissipate and wild speculation is gone, the global confidence curve of crypto is flat, longterm deflationary appreciation begins and “margin capture” of what were once traditional bank margins (profits) is the new speculation as YOU become the bank

 - Two major US banks consolidate/merge 

 - Ethereum’s next major upgrade hype is an on-chain oracle 

 - US Treasury sets up probate crypto address 

 - London is no longer the world’s forex Capitol, their failure to adapt to crypto and their innovation lag is devastating

- Updated some of the spelling errors and minor typos. 
- Updated to reflect most recent spike and crash

I want to start off with two of the main misconceptions I’ve seen in the past few weeks. 

1. Question: Dogecoin was created a joke/meme, how can people realistically take something created as joke seriously? 

Answer: 
There are plenty of examples of a product, idea, or technology being created with one intention, and then growing and evolving into another.

Parody’s are a perfect example of this. In fact, one could consider Dogecoin to be a parody of bitcoin/Litecoin. Just because something is a parody or joke does not take away the quality of what has been created. There are plenty of examples where parody’s out grew in popularity or, in fact, were better than the original. 

Dogecoin was created In 2013 and has survived 8 years which is WAY longer than 99% of other cryptocurrency that die out in 1-2 years or less. It’s had 8 years to develop as well an active development team working on making improvements right now. The code is being updated all the time and you can check the code on GitHub. 

Bitcoin was created to be used as exchange of goods and services - yet 60% of all bitcoin haven’t been spent in over a year. Is bitcoin a failure because it’s terrible at was it was CREATED for? No. It’s utility changed. Which is okay. Just because something was created for one thing, does not mean it’s use cannot change. The meme aspect of Dogecoin absolutely zero impact on its functionality as a legitimate cryptocurrency. It’s literally just the name. Ironically enough, the fact that the creator named the cryptocurrency after the doge meme is actually HELPFUL to its success. Cryptocurrency has notoriously been a complicated subject; by embracing novelty and giving Dogecoin a name that is easily recognizable to the general population actually allows for dogecoin to be a great entry point for new comers into cryptocurrency. 

We have all witnessed the power of a meme, the depths it can reach in society, especially in recent years. We have seen it many times before with video games, consoles, Oreos, or as of late even toilet paper... A meme has inherent value in the form of “widespread information”. A meme can spread an idea across diverse communities, and even entire countries literally overnight. This can bring about lasting effects on culture and society. If correctly taken advantage of, Doge can become the dominant meme currency of the internet, and amass real-world value just by being a popular, recognisable meme itself. This is where the saying “Dogecoin is the people’s coin” comes from. This is marketing 101. If your idea, or product is too complicated or not enough people know about then it doesn’t matter how technologically sound it is. Dogecoin have the best technology? No. Can it be improved upon. Definitely. In fact, the original developers have started working on the project again. An analogy I like to use is this. McDonald’s makes hamburgers. They have a clown as a mascot. A literal personification of a joke. Does make McDonald’s make the best hamburgers? No. Does McDonald’s have “value” in their industry? Undeniably so. So what does McDonald’s do correctly? They provide a cheap, easily accessible, and brand able product to the masses. Which is what dogecoin does for cryptocurrency. 

2. Question: is Dogecoin a shitcoin? What is a shitcoin and why are people calling Dogecoin one?

Answer: shitcoin is a term r/cryptocurrency created to describe a cryptocurrency with little to no value or digital currency that has no immediate, discernable purpose. The term is often used to describe altcoins or cryptocurrencies developed after bitcoins became popular. 

There are literally thousands of shitcoins. There are approximately 4,000 Cryptocurrencies in existence and pretty much anything outside of the top 30 are indeed, shitcoins. 

Dogecoin is not one of those shitcoins.

The people who say dogecoin is a shitcoin have done absolutely zero research, or if they have are misinformed. Most of the time they are just repeating some BS they heard on Twitter or Reddit without checking if what they’re saying is true. Pretty much every misconception about Dogecoin has been to over wrong. (I am going to discuss these misconceptions in detail below) Dogecoin may appear at first glance as just a joke or a meme, and therefore valueless due to its name. However, the name aspect of Dogecoin has absolutely zero impact on its viability as a cryptocurrency. Dogecoin actually has great utility (usefulness) to be used for exchange of goods and services. 

Some people will never take it seriously.  That's just the facts of it. DOGE is the ""crypto"" of cryptocurrencies in that none of the ""boomers"" believe in it but it's just steadily chugging along, gaining value.  10 years from now maybe they'll pull a Peter Schiff and be like I guess I was wrong or they'll still be cursing it. It doesn’t change the fact that Dogecoin is successful, has value and useful at Cryptocurrencies intended purpose to exchange goods and services. It's accepted as a method at payment at more places than 99.9% of cryptocurrencies.  That should be all the validation you need.  It's the Official Joke Coin and people can hate but it's official status will keep it around and always in the picture. 

3. Question: Why Dogecoin? What is Dogecoin useful for? What is its utility 

Answer: For the Lolz. Well, not quite. Initially as a purely meme-driven alternative to the likes of Bitcoin and Litecoin, Dogecoin in-fact boasts very low transaction fees and fast transaction times, very little network congestion, and most importantly, is designed to be used as a daily means of exchange, like your morning cup of coffee. Also, it is really fun, and who doesn't like the Dog ?!
		
Think of it like this: to exchange goods and services without currency, one must barter. I can barter a service (a haircut, for example) towards someone who needs a haircut, and in exchange they can barter a good or service to me.Currency then becomes an ""IOU"" (I Owe yoU) so that, if somebody needs me to cut their hair, they can give me an IOU for a good or service they control. When enough people begin adopting this, a centralized currency eventually takes hold. Crypto seeks to take this a step further and, instead of relying on building up a centalization in terms of valuable metals or debt, it is built up solely on the exchange of goods and services. Dogecoin, compared to other cryptocurrencies, finds itself in a strange position where the origins did NOT see it soaring to the moon in any situation. Funny how things can change in time. Dogecoin has pros and cons to it. Comparing it to other cryptos, it does not face a supply cap like Bitcoin does. It is not a directly equated asset, such as how Bitcoin can be attributed as a digital gold asset. Mining dogecoin is also much simpler (comparitively) and does not face difficulty spikes, a source of Bitcoin slow-down. It however, does indeed have a purpose and is beeyb

4. Question: Places to buy dogecoin places where you can spend Dogecoin? 

Answer: Refer to r/dogecoin posts by the moderators for a list of businesses that accept doge as payment. 

5. Question: Difference between cold storage, internet wallets and Robinhood/exchanges

Answer: 
Coldstorage - in the cryptocurrency world cold storage refers to physical objects/devices that contain your cryptocurrency. 

Wallets are an electronic program of service that stores your cryptocurrency. There a number of different wallets - but I personally use Dogecoin.info

Exchanges - an exchange is a company that holds a large sum of cryptocurrency - this case Dogecoin. They exchange fiat currency (paper money) for cryptocurrency. When you have your money on an exchange it is in the custody of the exchanges wallet until you transfer it to your personal wallet. Through legally binding user agreements you do technically own the coins, however in order to use your cryptocurrency you need to have it in your personal wallet. The same way you can’t use money in the bank - you have to cash out by withdrawing your money. Certain exchanges allow withdraw - others do not. Robhinhood currently doesn’t allow withdraws, but they are working on making this happen. 

If you would like to help increase the speed at which Robhinhood adds their withdraw feature read my article here:

https://www.reddit.com/r/dogecoin/comments/llaj7t/about_robhinhood_better_solution_than_selling_and/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf

6. Question: Does Dogecoin have value? How does Dogecoin increase in price or decrease in price? 

Answer: Yes. Dogecoin has value. If didn’t have value then it wouldn’t be bought or sold at all. Anything can have value as long as enough people assign it value and agree to it. The value of any means of exchange is fundamentally driven by supply and demand. If two parties agree that X amount of asset A is roughly worth the same as Y amount of asset B, you effectively have established a market.  That’s why the US dollar and other fiat currency has value even though it just a piece of paper. The difference between fiat currency and cryptocurrency is that fiat currency is determined by centralized government and other underlying economical/market conditions. Cryptocurrency is meant to be a decentralized form of fiat currency. Now as to why the price changes from say .05 to .06 (random numbers using this as an example for explanation purposes. It is not exact) this value is driven primarily by supply and demand. We already know the supply of Dogecoin, so for the purpose of this the main driving factor in the change in price is demand. But the demand for Dogecoin isn’t just one person. It’s the entire group of people who own Dogecoin. So if at any given time lets say 10 people with 1000 Dogecoin want to sell. But only 5 people want to buy 1000 Dogecoin. This means that the sellers “value” Dogecoin less at its current price than buyers do. 5000 Dogecoin less. This changes to price from .05 to .049. The same applies if more people wanted to buy. Then the price would go from .05 to .051. An algorithm repeats the process over and over constantly updating the price. However that’s only one way to change the value. The best way to increase the overall value of the currency in the long run is by eventually by exchanging your coins for goods, services, or just by tipping and trading with other Dogecoin holders. This gives Dogecoin utility. Which basically means that it can be used for something other than just buying Dogecoin at a certain price and selling it another. That is why you see people pushing to accept Dogecoin as payment. If legitimatize Dogecoin as a cryptocurrency and currency when companies allow you to exchange it for goods and services. As the value of Dogecoin rises, more and more businesses will recognise its potential and importance, and subsequently begin to accept it in exchange for goods and services. This will also help to grow the overall value as well as developer community around Dogecoin.

7. Question: Circulation of currencies. The importance of buying, selling, and holding - and the differences between them. 
		
Answer: To briefly explain this, a lot of people have been saying “buy and hold” or “I’m never selling!” - which in itself is great start. But there remains a lot of misinformation around the topic, for example that simply ""buying and holding Doge"" will drive up the price indefinitely. Unfortunately, that is just not true. Buying, holding, and selling are all intricately connected with each other. ALL of those three states are essential for a (digital) currency to flourish. Holding does neither hurt or raise the value of the asset, but rather it helps to establish a baseline, which is also called ""setting a floor"". Those who have diligently kept on holding their coins, have allowed Dogecoin to stabilize at its current price point. Remember, this remains a huge gain from where Dogecoin has been just months ago. An active circulation of a currency is critical to establishing it as an effective means of exchanging goods and setting it up for long term growth.

8. Question - 100 people own the top wallets which account for 65% of the total supply of Dogecoin. How can Dogecoin be a decentralized currency or a solid investment if 100 can negatively impact the market
Answer: 
The people who say this are just repeating what they’ve heard from someone else without doing research. They are trying to spread fear, uncertainty and doubt or they just don’t realize what they are saying is misinformation. 

While the statement 100 wallets own 65% is true, A lot of those top wallets are exchanges. What this means, is that legally speaking, these exchanges are holding a supply either to exchange with their customer base, or their customer base out right controls those coins. The majority of these wallets are not single individuals who can just sell off 2 billion Dogecoin at once. There are definitely some whales, but not every single large wallet is a whale. On top of that, this issue does not apply specifically to Dogecoin; but is in fact a problem with the majority of cryptocurrency yet people only point it out with Dogecoin. 

With just a bit of research you can find out which wallets are more than likely exchanges. 

DH5 (#1) is almost for sure RH. A lot of people think that. And it would make sense. They do not allow wallets, making the prices within the platform, so they'd need a much bigger wallet than everyone else.

DCUrda (#4) is an exchange for sure (tracked down several TXs to that same source). it's most likely Binance.

#7 is the burn wallet for doge Party
#18 is an exchange (most likely Crypto.com)
#21 is probably an exchange but could also be a trading bot
#22 is an exchange 

Once you take this into account it becomes clear that this is just a misconception and a non-issue 

8.  Question: Mining Dogecoin. How new Dogecoin are created and enter the market/supply. It there an infinite supply of Dogecoin being produced? Comparison to Bitcoin and the US dollar. 

Answer:
mining is the process of creating new cryptocurrency by solving a computational puzzle. mining is necessary to maintain the ledger of transactions upon which cryptocurrency is based. Miners have become very sophisticated over the last several years using complex machinery to speed up mining operations. Approximately 600,000 dogecoins are produced per hour and 5,256,000,000 (5.26 billion) per year and there are currently approximately 128,000,000,000 (128 billion) Dogecoin. Now let’s compare this information to what we know about Bitcoin. Bitcoin currently has a supply of 18.5 million. Currently 900 Bitcoin are mined per day or 328,500 per year. However, unlike Dogecoin, Bitcoins mining rate is not fixed. Bitcoin has something known as a Bitcoin halving which means at some point in the future instead of 900 per day being mined 450 are mined. Now let’s compare Dogecoin and Bitcoin to the US Dollar. The US Dollar has an estimated paper money supply (more on this covered in a later section) of approximately (1.2 to 2 trillion) and in 2019 the federal reserve printed 188.3 billion paper dollars. This means that there is 10 times more supply of dollars to Dogecoin and the government prints 37 times more dollars than Dogecoin is mined per year. It is also important to note that this increase in supply of Dogecoin is fixed. It never changes. The federal reserve can change how much they print any given year. Many people think that this means that the supply of Dogecoin is infinite or infinitely increasing. That is not true in the span of our life time. It will take approximately 24 years for the supply of Dogecoin to double and it will take 360 years for the supply of Dogecoin to reach the current supply of the US Dollar. That’s without taking into account the fact that federal reserve adds more dollars each year than Dogecoin adds to its supply each year. Technically speaking the supply of Dogecoin will eventually reach infinity if given enough time but you have to remember that infinity isn’t an actual number. You can’t mine “infinite” dogecoin because infinity isn’t a number. It’s a mathematical concept to describe something that is boundless. Dogecoin doesn’t have a boundless increase. It has a fixed increase a set amount added at a specific interval. So in practical terms for the purpose of using Dogecoin as a legitimate currency, this infinite argument against Dogecoin doesn’t matter. In fact it’s actually way better than Bitcoin at exchanging goods and services because of this fact. That is why the price per Bitcoin is in the ten thousand range the price per Dogecoin is in the cents range That is why it costs .00012 Bitcoin for milk but only 50 Dogecoin for that same commonly traded commodity. That’s why Bitcoin will be treated like digital gold. That is why Dogecoin will be considered the next dollar. The price per coin are inherently different because their supplies are different.

9.  Question: Should Dogecoin have a cap on its supply. What does having a cap mean, why do some cryptocurrency have a cap and other don’t? How does it affect the price? Will adding a cap increase the price per Dogecoin. Comparing bitcoin (capped) Dogecoin (no hard cap) 


Answer: - 
When people say they want a supply cap - what they are saying is that they want to place a limit on the total possible supply of Dogecoin. They point to bitcoin as having a cap, and since bitcoin has a cap, that must be why it is valued so high. Through scarcity. That is partially true, but it’s not because of the cap. The scarcity doesn’t come from having a cap, it comes from having a low supply and mining amount which reduces over time. Known as a bitcoin halving. 

Bitcoin and Dogecoin are two completely different cryptocurrency. Their supplies are different. Their utility is different. Having a cap does nothing in terms of the actual value of Dogecoin or bitcoin at the current moment. The cap only matters once that limit has been reached. The cap for bitcoin doesn’t happen until 2140. The price of bitcoin is due to the limited supply (18 million) relative to the global population, the bitcoin mining rate and bitcoin halving. All things that Dogecoin does differently. That doesn’t mean Dogecoin doesn’t have value. It doesn’t mean Dogecoin is infinite. It just means that they’re different.

Adding a cap won’t automatically increase the price because the cap isn’t the problem. You can’t reduce the 128 billion supply (unless you burn them or lose them). They already exist. People get confused because they don’t understand inflation and continual growth and why they are necessary for Dogecoin to a successful cryptocurrency based on the core parameters made when Dogecoin was created. They also don’t understand infinity. Dogecoin is not infinite. It can never reach infinity because infinity isn’t a number. As long as Dogecoin exists and is being mined it is not infinite. 

To further this point the original developers of Dogecoin have already stated that they will NOT be adding a cap. Adding a cap fundamentally changes Dogecoin at its core level and they’re just not going to do it. Here is the direct answer from the Dogecoin developers: “A, block reward is needed to secure Dogecoin network in a decentralized manner. Dogecoin is merge-mined with Litecoin, and that makes it somewhat secure against PoW attacks. But if Dogecoin reward will be too low, some Litecoin miners may drop Dogecoin, and our security will suffer. From this point of view, bigger reward is better. If you propose reducing the reward over time, you must also propose a solid way to keep Dogecoin secure. Now about the economic aspect. Current Dogecoin issue rate, taken relative to current total amount, is low, it's almost nothing compared to all the other factors that affect Dogecoin value. If you look at Dogecoin price chart since the introduction of current issue schedule, you will not see effects of ""inflation"" for all the wild price changes caused by other factors. And this already low issue rate gets even smaller over time, compared to total amount of dogecoins. The only real reason for these ""cap"" proposals is trying to ""sell"" Dogecoin to investors under the premise of possibly increased scarcity in the future. In my opinion, we don't need to try to appeal to investors. Dogecoin value will be increasing because of strong community and increased usage. And the fact that Dogecoin value increases is already enough for investors to jump in and increase it even more.”
You can read the full response to this directly from the developers here: https://github.com/dogecoin/dogecoin/issues/1674

Even if they DID add a cap it would actually be LESS beneficial for Dogecoin as a currency. 

Here’s some Basic economics explaining why. Inflation and deflation are common economic terms used to explain the change in the inherent value of a currency. This means that that 1 US Dollar today does not have the same value or “worth” as it did, for example, in 1950. Inflation is a situation of rising prices in the economy. A more exact definition of inflation is a sustained increase in the general price level in an economy. Deflation on the other hand occurs when the inflation rate falls below 0%, that is a negative inflation rate. While inflation reduces the value of a currency over time, a sudden deflation of a currency increases its relative value. This would allow more goods and services to be bought than before with the same amount of currency. Deflation can be a factor in leading to a recession and also result in a deflationary spiral.

Common follow up question:
What does all this mean with regards to cryptocurrency, specifically Bitcoin versus Dogecoin?

Well - Bitcoin is stagnant or deflationary over time, while Dogecoin is inflationary overtime. This is due to the way they are architected and mined, and how new coins are added into their respective markets What gets misunderstood is which one is “better” or rather ""the lesser evil"". Dogecoin doesn't need a supply limit like Bitcoin, because in the long run it will be much easier to exchange Dogecoin for goods and services, than with other crypto currencies or regular currencies for that matter. Bitcoin will continue to skyrocket in price because less and less are being mined. Bitcoin is like gold. Dogecoin is like the dollar. Bitcoin and Dogecoin have their pros and cons. Our current money is backed by signatures on debt contracts, not on real values. But it works, because we believe in it, even if it will be our downfall if it continues like this. Dogecoin is different. Dogecoin has a set amount of coins entering the market by the minute. There are plenty of spreadsheets out there showcasing exactly how much many Dogecoin will be in circulation at any given moment of time. People get confused because they think inflation is a bad thing, when in fact it is actually beneficial in small quantities and beneficial to the longevity of a currency.
Currencies have inflation - commodities don’t. Dogecoin is better suited to be a currency than Bitcoin is. Bitcoin is better suited to be a digital version of gold.

10. Question: Is a Dogecoin increase to the equivalent of one US dollar possible? Could and will it potentially happen? What would change if it does happen? How high could Dogecoin realistically rise in price? | Market cap explanation, and comparison to US currency and global FIAT currency. 

Answer: 
Economically speaking Dogecoin can rise to whatever value the market dictates based off of supply and demand. As long as demand out paces the supply then the value will rise. 

However, I see people asking what’s stopping Dogecoin from going to bitcoin levels? Well, The short answer is the supply of Dogecoin is high relative to the supply of bitcoin. Dogecoin has a current supply of 128 billion, which is why the price is lower and harder to change in value. It is easier for bitcoin to rise $1 in price because the supply of bitcoin is so low and the supply of Dogecoin is so high.  It doesn’t mean that Dogecoin can’t rise in price - just that it’s harder. 

This is the long answer.
First, It is important to note that demand does not necessarily equate to adding dollars to the system in 1 to 1 ratio. Demand can increase without ever having to add money into the system, however, adding new money into the system does help. I see people saying Dogecoin requires X million dollars per minute to account for the increase in supply. That is just completely wrong, and not how demand works. Increased Demand just means more people willing to trade Dogecoin at a higher price than people willing to trade at the current price. No net increase in fiat currency needs to be added in order for demand to increase. 

Despite not having a capped supply, using the current supply known, as well as the mining rate to account for new coins entering - you can make comparisons to other cryptocurrency to get an idea of the demand required in order for Dogecoin to reach a certain price.  The way to do this is through market cap comparisons 

Mathematically speaking market cap = price multiplied by supply
MC (Market Cap) = P (Current Price) x S (Current Supply)

Before moving forward, I want to explain market cap and the misconceptions behind its as well as how to correctly use it. 

Market cap just means how much the total supply is “valued/worth” at a certain price. The exact definition applies to stocks; not cryptocurrency how ever for our purposes the mathematics still apply.
I see people saying how Dogecoin has a current market cap of $X billion market cap and what the market cap needs to be for Dogecoin to be $1 is $128 billion. Then they say if 100 million people put $1000 in doge then doge will = $1.

THAT’S NOT HOW MARKET CAP WORKS.

*MARKET CAP DOES NOT MEAN TOTAL AMOUNT OF MONEY IN THE SYSTEM - A 6 billion dollar market cap does not mean there’s 6 billion dollars in the system. It means that the entire supply is “worth” 6 billion at the current price. When I originally wrote this people got confused so I wanted to clarify that. Market cap is a comparison tool that I use in this example to show how Dogecoin would look at each price point* I cover market cap in more detail here: https://www.reddit.com/r/dogecoin/comments/ltuevh/how_market_cap_actually_works/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf

Simply adding money to the system does absolutely nothing to affect market cap in the same way it does not necessarily change the price/demand. The only two variables that change the market cap are price and supply nothing else can change the market cap. 

Market caps REAL use is a comparison tool. It’s used to compare how successful a market is compared to other markets. 

If Dogecoin were to reach $1 today it would have a market cap of about 128 billion dollars ($1 x 128,495,957,919 circulating supply). Bitcoin (the most successful cryptocurrency) currently has a market cap of approximately $898,761,019,333 (~ $900 billion). This means that at $1, the total supply of Dogecoin would be “worth” about 1/7th of Bitcoins total supply. 

The take away from this comparison is that in order to reach $1 Dogecoin would require approximately 1/7th the current demand of bitcoin due to the differences in supply between Dogecoin and bitcoin. This is definitely not impossible, and an achievable goal. If Dogecoin were to reach the demand bitcoin has currently - its price would $7. Since bitcoin is the highest performing cryptocurrency, $7 dollars is the most realistic possible goal at current market conditions. Anything past $7 dollars per coin means that Dogecoin is reaching uncharted territory for cryptocurrency as it will have surpassed bitcoin.

Now for the hypothetical extension of this comparison. Everything after this point is hypothetical since we don’t have a true comparison available in the market

The estimated supply of the US dollar is about $2,000,000,000 (2 trillion), thus the market cap of the US currency is $2 trillion. If Dogecoin were to reach the equivalent market cap ($2tn / $128bn), the price per Dogecoin would have to be $15.60, thus matching the entire short-term US currency (M0 money supply in economics).

This is definitely not impossible, but it is highly highly improbable to reach such value any time soon. If that were to ever happen, it would take years. Now, the entire supply of the entire worlds fiat (short-term liquidity / paper) currency is $37 trillion. You can apply the same logic from above and see that the value of Dogecoin would have to be $288.60. If it was valued any higher than that amount, Dogecoin would be ""worth"" more than the entire world’s short-term liquidity currencies combined. It could technically go past this point, but what that would mean is that the economy behind Dogecoin would be stronger than the entire global economy of today. At that value you wouldn’t even compare it to the dollar anymore because it already surpassed all fiat currency. It’s not impossible- but is is highly unrealistic to pass that point. It is important to note that this number is not static. Which means if the market conditions change such as an increase in supply or change in price the numbers will change.


11. Question: Elon Musk - Is he important for Dogecoin? The impact of celebrities and big business supporting Dogecoin Celebrity/Influencer Involvement

Answer: (shortened to save room) Elon musk is a supporter of doge and his comments have weight but he does not control the price of Dogecoin. It was on a rise before he joined the hype train and started tweeting about it. 

12. Question: What is a 51% attack? Can it realistically happen? What are the implications if it were to happen?

Answer: A 51% attack refers to an attack on a blockchain most commonly bitcoin. Such an attack is possible but still just hypothetical. It requires group of miners to control more than 50% of the network's mining hash rate or computing power.

The attackers would be able to prevent new transactions from gaining confirmations, allowing them to halt payments between some or all users. They would also be able to reverse transactions that were completed while they were in control of the network, meaning they could double-spend coin. 

They would almost certainly not be able to create new coins or alter old blocks. A 51% attack would probably not destroy bitcoin or another blockchain-based currency outright, even if it proved highly damaging.

You may have seen an article going around talking about the 51% attack and why it will cause Dogecoin to go to zero. Regarding the 51% Hashrate attacks, Yes, they are real, and have been ever since cryptocurrencies aka Bitcoin started. The article even mentions an example. Now, if a large group of people with a lot of resources very effectively coordinated, they could indeed make a 51% attack on Dogecoin happen. But not just on Dogecoin, but also on many other, small cryptocurrencies. This is nothing new, this has basically been known for the last 10+ years. But the author of the article needs clicks, so there goes the horror-scenario headline... Possible - yes, absolutely. Likely, not very. Unless you have a large sum of people with a few resources each coordinating perfectly - that is in my honest opinion very unlikely - you could have governments, very large hedge funds, or maybe Elon Musk build a vast array of mining farms and do said 51% Hashrate attack. But again, that effort would only be worthwhile if those groups had a definite interest in destroying Dogecoin. There are probably other cryptocurrencies that would be more interesting from that perspective, such as litecoin. Of course, despite the sensationalist headline, for them clicks, the author covers their own backside by stating the following:
""In conclusion...Pretty much all the crypto besides Bitcoin and Ethereum are at material risk of a 51% attack, and it's not just a theoretical risk."" This problem is not tied specifically to Dogecoin, but to every single cryptocurrency. Now let’s do some math to calculate exactly how much it would cost in order to succeed in pulling off a 51% attack on Dogecoin. Dogecoin has a hash rate of 299.17 TH/s or 299,170,000 MH/s. If you were to use an RTX3090 which costs $2,000 US Dollars, and has a hash rate of 121 MH/s. You would need 1,260,964 RTX3090 at a cost of $2,521,928,926 dollars ($2.5 billion). Is it possible? Yes. Is it likely? No. 

13. Question: Dogecoin can only process 33 transactions per second - if Dogecoin wants to truly be a successful means of exchanging goods on a mass level it this transaction speed is not enough

Answer: the problem with this line of thinking is that they are making an assumption that the transactions per second is a permanent issues. At the current demand the transactions per second works perfectly fine and when it gets to a point where this needs to be improved, the technology is available to do so. 

Dogecoin is moving to a multichain future. There's no reason point of sale settlements would need to be conducted on the main network. Cryptocurrency is an advanced technology and there’s no reason that asset (dogecoin) and chain (main dogecoin network), are bound to each other in a way that the asset (dogecoin) cannot be enhanced by other chains.

A really good, present day example of this sort of crosschain stuff is thorchain. it's based on some work on cosmos, and it essentially gives the ability to run smart contracts, trade, do defi and liquidity pools - all without actually taking any of the other networks coin off the main chain. Bitcoins lightening network is another example. Smart network chains like flare network and thorchain will support doge. 

If transaction speed is even an issue, the solution can be provided without changing a single thing on the mainnet. It's really a non issue brought up by people just trying to find any possible reason to doubt doge. They usually bring this point up after their other arguments have been proven wrong. The only real question is what chain will develop an easy solution for doge POS payments, and which one will become standard.It's kind of amusing too, because in their 'criticism' is the implication of doge becoming a mainstream point of sale currency 

14. Question: There is a lack of developer support for Dogecoin. The technology is outdated. Why would anyone come work as a Dogecoin developer when there are thousands of other cryptocurrencies? 

Answer: the original Dogecoin developers have already began working on the project with the new found support of the community and companies accepting Dogecoin as payment. The short answer is there is already development being done due to recent weeks bringing Dogecoin back into relevancy. Two Dogecoin developers are very active in the community. You can see their posts and reach out directly. However, remember they are extremely busy working on their personal lives and adding upgrades to the underlying technology behind Dogecoin. Their usernames are u/patricklodder and u/rnicoll. 

15.  Question: if all of the above information is true why are so many people such as r/cryptocurrency and others are trying to discredit Dogecoin as legitimate cryptocurrency.  

Answer: The r/cryptocurrency and the majority of people are horribly misinformed. They find out about Dogecoin and take their biases and apply them Dogecoin before researching. R/cryptocurrency is a specific subset of society who has an extremely knowledgeable background in computer science and computer coding.  They may have a solid understanding of the technology aspect of cryptocurrency but the reason why Dogecoin will be successful is based on economics, mathematics, social theory and statistics as WELL as the underlying technology. Each of these topics is extremely intricate and each field requires years to fully master. No one person has all of the knowledge of all aspects of a cryptocurrency so when someone is attacking Dogecoin on why it won’t be successful is probably misinformed. Dogecoin is already successful. It’s been proven already. The question is HOW successful. Which nobody really knows the answer to. A large majority of r/cryptocurrency are gatekeepers who horde their knowledge while the Dogecoin community is focused on explaining and educating new people. R/cryptocurrency is notorious for being extremely serious and a lot of them feel threatened that something that started at as a joke/meme has the potential to be better at cryptocurrencies intended purpose - exchanging goods and services - than Bitcoin or any other popular cryptocurrency which is deflationary in nature. Others will try to discredit it because Dogecoin because it is novel and has gained popularity. There’s a lot of people who will discredit Dogecoin/cryptocurrency in general just because it’s new(ish) technology or because they don’t understand how it can be used. 

16. Question: Will cryptocurrency replace fiat currency. Will cryptocurrency be the next world currency. Will the next world currency be Dogecoin?

Answer: 
Cryptocurrency is in its infancy. People don’t realize the worldwide paradigm that is taking place right in front of our eyes. People are starting to see that traditional fiat (paper) currency back by centralized governments and debt are flawed and can be improved upon. Cryptocurrency is the future whether the people who can’t see it or try to disagree believe it or not. It’s inevitable. I knew it was inevitable in 2013 when I first heard about Bitcoin. A cryptocurrency will replace fiat currency in the future. Will it be Bitcoin? ETH? Dogecoin? Ada? Some other cryptocurrency that doesn’t exist yet? I don’t know. Cryptocurrency is taking the financial sector by storm - odds are there’s going to be a few key cryptocurrency for each aspect. - ones replacing fiat, ones replacing precious metals, ones replacing the banking system through deFi. Honestly getting into cryptocurrency now is like supporting the internet in the 80s - nobody knows where it’s going to be in 30 years",31.0,2021-04-20 20:50:18,0.96
"Scalability Race - Update 2, Late April 2021","Didn't think I would post an update a mere 2 weeks after the initial post: [https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/mjyvxz/ethereum\_scalability\_race\_april\_2021\_update/](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/mjyvxz/ethereum_scalability_race_april_2021_update/). I highly recommend reading that post for a primer on the various scalability options available.

But with the ETHGlobal Scaling Ethereum summit currently ongoing, we have tons of news on rollups. It took a few days, but I finally managed to get through the key presentations. Definitely worth watching if you have a cool 7 hours to spare: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hsksm\_by7LQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hsksm_by7LQ)

Or, here are some highlights:

**Matter Labs** [**announced details about zkPorter**](https://medium.com/matter-labs/zkporter-a-breakthrough-in-l2-scaling-ed5e48842fbf)**.** Essentially, this is a Validium-like solution - a ZK rollup architecture but data availability is off-chain. Where it improves on Validium is that the data availability committee is partially decentralized with its own proof-of-stake consensus mechanism. They haven't released details about the consensus mechanism yet, but we know there's slashing mechanisms involved and it's implied to be real proof-of-stake, not delegated-type like pretty much every non-ethereum L1. zkSync 2.0 uses a Volition-like architecture where developers and/or users can seamlessly choose between Rollup or zkPorter modes for their desired level of security vs fees trade-off.

While you do compromise on security with zkPorter, **it still offers far superior scalability, decentralization and security characteristics than any alternate non-ethereum L1**. The worst case scenario is a super-majority 67% of zkPorter validators collude to freeze your funds - but it also freezes their own stake.

I have one strong criticism for Matter Labs, though - their marketing here is tone-deaf, by dubiously antagonizing optimistic rollups. Like I mentioned above, what they should really do is aggressively market against alternate L1s. There's currently $250 billion+ misallocated into many of these ghost chains, and almost all of them don't hold a candle to a programmable ZK rollup in terms of scalability, security or decentralization, let alone all three. By adding zkPorter to the mix, we now have scalability that's completely impossible with L1s unless you centralize your validation to supercomputers like Solana is doing - at this point, it's no longer a decentralized, trustless network.

Of course, Matter Labs is not alone - **StarkWare is building a similar solution for StarkNet**, where they will have a data availability consensus mechanism to add to Validium. However, StarkNet is only planning to get there in 2022, while zkSync 2.0 will potentially have the entire stack live on mainnet by late 2021. There's plenty of exciting progress for StarkNet before then, though. In May, we will have the StarkNet single-app rollups - what they call Planets - live on testnet. Once Planets are done, anyone will be able to release their own arbitrary code using the Cairo language, on their own single-app rollup. Where it gets interesting is Constellations, where it brings a multi-app rollup this is due to release in late 2021.

On the point of Validium data availability consensus mechanisms, it's important that data sharding (what was previously ""Phase 1"" and now due after The Merge) will bring massive data availability to L1. However, I can still see zkPorter/Validium being relevant to potentially accelerate low-value high-throughput applications like gaming or social networks (which are currently impossible using any blockchain tech) to the tune of millions of TPS.

**Optimism and Arbitrum** both have their public release-candidate testnets out now. Optimism is taking a more conservative approach with guardrails and whitelists for contract deployment on mainnet. A common misconception is that ""Optimism is delayed till at least July"". In reality, they have been live on mainnet since January. As per their whitelist approach, we'll see Synthetix to gradually move more of their functionality over to L2 over the next couple of months, and I expect to see Uniswap V3, Maker Protocol and a handful of others join them there. The July timeline is for when Optimism turns off the whitelists and anyone will be able to deploy smart contracts. It's also important to note that this whitelist is for developers only - users can freely use Optimistic Ethereum. Meanwhile, Arbitrum's key advantages over Optimism are they have no such whitelists and their testnets and upcoming mainnet deployment will be open to all from day one. Arbitrum also supports BLS signature aggregation natively already - the same cryptographic innovation that makes >120,000 validators possible on beacon chain today can also be used to dramatically improve batching and scalability. Of course, Optimism has the industry support at this time, but it'll be curious to see this space develop.

Optimism's approach of aligning its clients with Geth should mean it's the most Ethereum-like environment of the bunch. They fully plan to implement L1 innovations like EIP-1559, statelessness to further enhance Optimistic Ethereum. Interestingly, ""zkEVM"" is in the works for Optimism. Though Karl (whose enthusiasm is forever infectious) doesn't go into details there - it is pretty clear the Optimism team is aware of the benefits of ZK rollups and fully plan to leverage the tech in the future in some form.

Finally, Polygon is also working on both optimistic and ZK rollups, and other non-rollup solutions, though their roadmap remains pretty vague for now.

**Summing up**: zkSync 2.0 may be stealing the show, but they need to prove their tech on testnet - which happens in May. We'll get a clearer picture then. Of course, Optimism is a force to be reckon with, and likely where most blue-chip DeFi projects will deploy first over the next 3 months or so. It's the closest to Ethereum L1, and for complex smart contracts that wish to maintain as close to like-for-like parallel deployments on L1 and L2 as Uniswap and Synthetix do, it's going to be the preferred option. Arbitrum could potentially be the first publicly available programmable rollup, and is still very closely aligned with L1 with the sweet benefits of BLS signature aggregation. StarkNet's tech is already proven with DeversiFi, dYdX and ImmutableX live on mainnet, and their methodical approach may prove pragmatic long-term. While zkSync 2.0 and StarkNet may diverge from L1 EVM more than Optimism, it also opens up potential benefits of L2-specific efficiency and scalability. I can totally see deployments for things like non-financial applications that skip L1 entirely and live purely on a ZK rollup and perhaps even on zkPorter/Validium. Indeed - this is what ImmutableX is doing.

Overall, the Scalability Race continues to heat up. It is still early, and each of these players have their own sets of strengths and weaknesses.

Despite all the noise around Dogecoin, BSC etc - this is the real narrative that is currently unfolding in the blockchain space that's going to have lasting impact on the industry for years to come. **On that note, it's very important to note that the rollups journey is just beginning, and it'll be a space that'll take several years to mature.** Make no mistake, though, this is the present and future of blockchain scalability.

PS: I focused on rollups here and forgot to mention that Berlin is now live, with EIP-2929 mitigating a DoS attack vector. Miners may now choose to up the block gas limit mildly, maybe something like 12.5M (current) to 15M. I haven't heard any concrete discussions about this, though, maybe someone in the mining community can comment here?",107.0,2021-04-19 05:19:16,0.99
A quick explanation of what the point of the EIP 2929 gas cost increases in Berlin is,"The Berlin hard fork primarily consisted of gas cost change EIPs: [EIP 2565](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2565) (modexp gas cost reduction), [EIP 2929](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2929) (SLOAD and \*CALL gas cost increase), and EIPs [2718](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2718) and [2930](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2930) to support compatibility for contracts affected by the gas cost increase as well as setting the stage for future upgrades.

By far the most important of these is EIP 2929. The core idea is this: the gas cost of SLOAD is increased from 800 to 2100, and the gas cost for CALL (including STATICCALL, DELEGATECALL and other opcodes) and external contract queries (BALANCE, EXTCODESIZE...) is increased from 700 to 2600, *but only in the case where the address or storage slot is being accessed for the first time in that transaction*.

The purpose of this is further DoS protection: earlier research [showed that](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1909.07220.pdf) storage access is the largest remaining DoS vulnerability in the Ethereum protocol, and it was possible to create some blocks that simply repeatedly accessed many accounts that would take as long as 80 seconds to process. The fix was a simple quick fix: make the thing that takes a long time (storage accesses requiring disk access) cost more gas, so this DoS issue can be \~3x weaker. In parallel with this, there has been some excellent work in the client teams implementing on-disk storage caches, reducing the number of database lookups required for storage loads and plugging this hole even further.

The gas cost repricing and these client improvements together make the existing chain safer, and make higher gas limits safer than they are today. After EIP 2929, the main reason to avoid large gas limit increases may actually be not DoS concerns, but state size growth (those these two things interplay: storage loads cost more when there is more storage). Hence, work on [state expiry and statelessness](https://hackmd.io/@vbuterin/state_expiry_paths) is going to be important, and probably should be priority #1 post-merge.

A second longer-term benefit of this repricing is that the maximum theoretical witness size for [stateless verification](https://dankradfeist.de/ethereum/2021/02/14/why-stateless.html) is reduced by \~3x. We are going to need another repricing for reading code (something like: 500 gas per 31-byte chunk of code accessed), but this can be done later.

Notable, the EIP only increases the gas cost of the *first* access per transaction. Subsequent accesses are actually made cheaper (100 gas in all cases). Additionally, calls to precompiles always cost 100 gas including the first call. This has some excellent positive consequences:

* Any use case of SLOAD followed by SSTORE (or SSTORE followed by SLOAD) of the same slot becomes cheaper. This is because the first storage read or write pays for accessing the storage slot, so it is already ""warm"" and the second read or write is cheaper; instead of a cost of 800 + 5000, we get a cost of 2100 + 2900 (approximately), a reduction of \~800. This may make ERC20 sends *cheaper*.
* Self-calling becomes cheaper
* Calls to precompiles become cheaper (this is especially valuable for low-gas-cost precompiles that many need to get called many times, like ECADD)

The first-access rule was added because when an account or storage slot is accessed the second time, that account or storage slot should already be cached in memory, so an expensive disk access is not required. And of course, two accesses of the same value also only require one witness entry.

TLDR:

* Yes, some things will get more expensive. But they have to be for security.
* But on the other hand, things that should have been cheaper all along (storing then loading the same slot) *will* finally be cheaper.
* Another important benefit is that moderately increasing the gas limit becomes safer. The main remaining impediment to *large* gas limit increases will likely be state size issues.",320.0,2021-04-15 18:43:50,0.99
Ethereum Successfully Launches Berlin Hard Fork,"Ethereum’s latest update went live at block 12,244,000 this morning.

  Key Takeaways

* Ethereum’s Berlin hard fork has gone live.
* The upgrade included several Ethereum Improvement Proposals focussed on changes to gas costs and transaction types.
* Ethereum will follow Berlin with its highly anticipated London hard fork this summer.

 

The second-biggest blockchain by market cap completes another major upgrade. 

## Ethereum Berlin Fork Launches 

Ethereum has just completed its Berlin hard fork. 

The update went live on Ethereum’s [block 12,244,000](https://goto.etherscan.com/block/12244000) this morning. Initially [confirmed on Mar. 8](https://blog.ethereum.org/2021/03/08/ethereum-berlin-upgrade-announcement/), the fork comprised four Ethereum Improvement Proposals. Abbreviated as “EIPs,” anyone can submit an Ethereum Improvement Proposal, and those accepted by the community get implemented into the blockchain. 

The first was EIP-2565, which lowers the gas cost for modular exponentiation, otherwise known as the “ModExp” function. The fork also included EIP-2929, which Vitalik Buterin and Martin Swende [put forward](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2929). EIP-2929 increases gas costs for state access operations (otherwise known as “opcodes”) and adds security improvements to the blockchain. The update also introduced EIP-2718 and EIP-2930, which involve defining a new transaction type for future transactions and adding a new transaction type that includes access lists. 

The Berlin fork involves several complex technicalities, but it had been anticipated across the community nonetheless. Many key Ethereum supporters took to Twitter to celebrate the milestone as it happened this morning. 

There were also two watch parties, hosted by [ETHStaker](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R638fPK3NQ) and [Ethereum Cat Herders](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GQcXUn5XG5c), two of Ethereum’s strongest communities. 

## EIP-1559 Looming 

Berlin’s completion takes Ethereum one step closer to London, the hard fork that will include its long-awaited EIP-1559 update. Tim Beiko, the coordinator for the various implementers and researchers working on EIP-1559, explained to Crypto Briefing that EIP-2929 and EIP-2718 are essential “prerequisites” in the lead-up to the update. 

EIP-1559 involves introducing a base fee to transactions, which represents the minimum amount of gas a transaction needs to get added to a block. This fee will then get burned, which will in turn reduce the supply of ETH (Beiko has previously referred to it as an [“ETH buyback”](https://cryptobriefing.com/ethereum-miners-oppose-eth-buyback-proposal/) proposal). It should also make the cost of transactions easier to predict—one problem with the current mechanism is that gas prices get entered as an estimate, which means many users overpay for transactions. 

Due to the improvement it’s expected to make on Ethereum’s monetary policy, EIP-1559 is the network’s most anticipated update since the Beacon Chain launch. However, some miners have [opposed the update](https://cryptobriefing.com/ethereum-miners-protesting-eip-1559-has-accelerated-upgrade-eth-2-0/), arguing that it will threaten the security of the network. It’s expected to ship in July or August. 

The merge phase of Serenity will follow the London hard fork. The Beacon Chain will be docked to Ethereum mainnet, marking the network’s long-awaited transition to Proof-of-Stake. Ethereum researcher Justin Drake recently ran a poll on when Proof-of-Stake could feasibly go live, to which Vitalik Buterin and others responded in favor of shipping the update this year. Drake [told Crypto Briefing](https://cryptobriefing.com/key-ethereum-researchers-vote-to-ship-proof-of-stake-in-2021/) that he was “confident” it will launch in 2021 at the time. 

The Serenity roadmap will finally see 64 new shard chains go live, marking the completion of Ethereum 2.0. 

With various [Layer 2 solutions](https://cryptobriefing.com/ethereum-scaling-solution-optimism-delays-launch-july/) also in development, it’s been a big year for Ethereum so far. The action has been reflected in its price: it currently has a market cap above $283 billion, with ETH trading at $2,446. That’s about 12.4% of the whole cryptocurrency market. 

*Disclosure: At the time of writing, the author of this feature owned ETH and several other cryptocurrencies.*

Think about the merge when investing in staking hardware,"Just as a reminder for everyone planning to buy a staking machine:

In probably around one year, possibly earlier, we will have the merge of the Ethereum execution chain with the PoS beacon chain to get rid of PoW. As the plans currently are, this will require running a tightly coupled duo of beacon node (+ validator) and a modified Eth1 client that uses the beacon chain for consensus. This ""Eth1 client"" will still create the blocks on the execution chain and run all the transactions in its EVM. And it will decide to which address the transaction tips for proposed blocks go, and be able to add transactions for MEV.

In short, I expect there will - at least for a while during the initial merge - be vastly increased incentives to run your own Eth1 node (or some similar client with the same hardware requirements).

So if you buy hardware now, I'd recommend getting something that can comfortably run both the Eth1 and Eth2 clients. Don't rely on infura or similar.",66.0,2021-04-14 19:58:45,0.96
Putting Your Stack to Work,"Here are 4 ways to earn passive returns on your ETH stack.  Each carries its own unique set of risks & rewards, so make sure to always dig into the details before going with one option or another.  Hopefully you can find something that matches your goals and risk appetite!

    ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ 

# Centralized Lending:

**Example Platforms:**   
BlockFi, Nexo, Gemini Earn, Celcius

**ELI5 What it is:**   
You deposit money into one of these lending platforms.  The lending platform then uses this money to lend to others, primarily institutions, earning interest. These platforms then share a portion of the loan interest with you. The user experience is much like using a centralized exchange.

**""Difficulty"" Level to Set up:**   
Easy

**Approximate ROI:**   
4-8% annual ROI on most crypto assets

**Risk Level:**   
Medium

**Risks:**

* ""Not your keys, not your crypto.""  These are centralized, custodial services. You are trusting them to hold onto your crypto and keep it safe.
* You are also trusting these platforms to lend in a responsible manner.  If they lend too much and the market drops down, it's possible there isn't enough assets to make lenders whole.  There is generally no insurance on these platforms.
* Rates may drop during bear markets or flat markets.

&#x200B;

    ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ 

# Decentralized Lending:

**Example Platforms:**   
Compound, Aave

**ELI5 What it is:**   
You put assets into a one of these platforms and it uses this money to lend to others.  These platforms give you the interest earned from that loan, removing the need for a middle man. These are DeFi applications, meaning you would need to interact with smart contracts via a UI and an Ethereum wallet like Metamask.

**""Difficulty"" Level to Set up:**   
Moderate

**Approximate ROI:**   
1% annual ROI on ETH, 9% on stablecoins

**Risk Level:**   
Low-Medium

**Risks:**

* Smart contract risk - if a bug were ever found in the smart contract, it would likely have major effects for all users. The major players in this space are pretty battle tested at this point, however, handling billions of dollars in assets.
* Rates may drop during bear markets or flat markets.

&#x200B;

    ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ 

# Providing Liquidity:

**Example Platforms:**   
Uniswap, Sushiswap

**ELI5 What it is:**   
You put a pair of assets into Uniswap (let's say ETH and USDT). This money is used to let traders swap between those two assets on the Uniswap platform.  As people make trades on Uniswap, the 0.3% trading fee is distributed across everyone that provided trading liquidity. The more people trade, the more trading fees you acquire.

(This process is also known as yield farming.  The generic term for this kind of platform is ""Automated Market Makers"" - AMMs)

**""Difficulty"" Level to Set up:**   
Moderate

**Approximate ROI:**   
Extremely variable. Can cause losses. Can be moderate (10%) returns. Can be monstrous (50%+) returns.

Think of it like you're selling shovels in a gold rush.

* The more people gold rushing, the more shovels you sell.(As trading volume goes up, that means more fees for you)
* The more people selling shovels, the less shovels you sell due to competition.(The more liquidity providers there are, the more people the trading fees are distributed across)
* If you pick the best place to sell shovels, you'll sell even more shovels.(Each liquidity pool is different. If you pick a hot pair of assets, there will be lots of trading volume.)

**Risk Level:**   
Medium-High

**Risks:**

* Smart contract risk - if a bug were ever found in the smart contract, it would likely have major effects for all users. The major players are very battle-tested at this point, however, handling billions of dollars in assets.
* Impermanent loss. These pools keep your assets in a 50/50 balance as prices fluctuate. If one of your assets craters, you will end up with lots of that asset and much less of the other. Providing liquidity on ETH and a small cap token can be extra risky (but also, potentially extra profitable).
* Returns may drop during bear markets or flat markets.

&#x200B;

    ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ 

# ETH 2.0 Staking:

**Ways to stake:**

* Can be done on your own with various software clients
* Can be done through exchanges like Kraken and Coinbase (""soon"")
* Can be done through decentralized protocols like Rocketpool (also ""soon"")

**ELI5 What it is:**   
The Ethereum network will soon be secured by people locking up ETH rather than running mining computers. For those that have 32 ETH, they can run ETH 2.0 validators using their own computer. For those that have less than 32 ETH (or don't want to go to the trouble of running it themselves), they can use staking services that pool together ETH from multiple people. This staked ETH is used to run and secure the ETH 2.0 chain, which had a phase 0 launch in December 2020. It runs in parallel to the current ETH 1.0 chain for now, and the two will eventually merge.

**""Difficulty"" Level to Set up:**

* Easy when using exchanges/custodial services
* Moderate difficulty for decentralized options
* Relatively high difficult to run it on your own

**Approximate ROI:**   
9% on ETH, but will likely decrease over time. If you use a service, they may also take a cut for themselves.

**Risk Level:**   
Medium

**Risks:**

* Technical upgrade risk. This is a major migration involving new software. There's no guarantee it will all go 100% perfectly.
* Lock-up phase. Once your ETH is in, you're locked into holding until ETH 2.0 receives more functionality upgrades. Some custodial services offer ways to escape this lock-up phase early, so always look into the full details of the platform you choose.
* Slashing. Validators that aren't available or are found to be misbehaving can be slashed, resulting in some of their staked ETH being burnt.",79.0,2021-04-14 14:59:02,0.98
"Ethereum is now unforkable, thanks to DeFi","**Article of the Day**: [Ethereum is now unforkable, thanks to DeFi](https://medium.com/dragonfly-research/ethereum-is-now-unforkable-thanks-to-defi-9818b967738f)

I completely missed this article when it came out almost *two* years ago, but I have recently seen the same thesis reiterated by other people and I find it extremely valuable to consider the ramifications put forth by Leland Lee and Haseeb Qureshi in this piece. 


**My summary:**

So back in 2019 the major Ethereum ""drama"" of the year was the proposed EIP-1057, also referred to as *ProgPoW*, which was put forth by a few people who wanted to change the mining algorithm to favor GPUs. (The vast majority of the community opposed ProgPoW and the EIP has never been implemented). 

Just like some are currently concerned that the chain could split after EIP-1559, back in 2019 some really thought ProgPoW could eventually break the chain in two. 

But, the article's authors put forth the argument that the fragility of DeFi single-handedly insures that Ethereum will never have a meaningful minority fork. 

*How?*

Well a fork creates a 1:1 copy of the entire blockchain and all its accounts. This new chain, called ""D-ETH,"" would have a new ether called D-ETH but it would also have D copies off every single ERC-20 and ERC-721 token and every single one of the millions of smart contracts on Ethereum. There would be D-USDC and D-DAI and D-COMP and even D-CryptoPunks and D-beeple's and so on. 

It's not hard to see how this new chain would instantly fall apart. One of the largest pitfalls the authors highlight is the new D-Maker: 

>It has too much D-ETH at stake in the minority fork to just ignore it. They could let the system ride out, but because the system is now backed with D-ETH instead of ETH, the system will be instantly undercollateralized post-fork. Almost every CDP must be liquidated, and the D-PETH must be auctioned off for D-Dai (which the system burns to deleverage itself). But there is little demand for the D-PETH that gets auctioned off, and most D-Dai holders are not paying attention to the minority fork, so the D-Dai supply is depressed. This leads to a massive undersupply of D-Dai and an oversupply of D-PETH being mass-sold into the market, causing a deleveraging spiral and huge price spike for D-Dai.

>Seeing this writing on the wall, Maker governance decides to simply trigger global settlement on the minority fork. It’s not worth the headache. All D-Dai on this chain gets liquidated and eventually converted into D-ETH balances. The D-Dai holders who are paying attention claim their D-ETH balances. But when they turn around to sell their new D-ETH, all the selling causes a rush for the exits, crashing the price for all other D-ETH holders.

>This causes anything dependent on D-Dai to instantly break. Uniswap D-Dai markets, Compound D-Dai markets, Augur v2, almost anything that uses D-Dai is now fundamentally broken. Even if they have fail safes in place for global settlement, most operators don’t have the infrastructure and deployment processes to manage their system on two chains, so many simply write it off.

And centralized stablecoins like D-USDC and D-USDT would be completely worthless unless the companies and institutions backing those projects decided to migrate from the main chain or support both chains. (There's absolutely no incentive to do so and actually a large disincentive to support D-ETH. E.g. if Circle wanted to also back the new D-USDC they would just be handing out a free $11 billion). 

When this article was published on October 31, 2019 there was ""only"" $602 million locked in DeFi. Today, that number has grown 91x to **$55.2 billion,** making it even harder to create a meaningful minority fork and providing a huge incentive for projects, users, developers and miners (at least until post-merge ;)) alike to continue to upgrade Ethereum together in a non-contentious manner.

I absolutely believe that not only will there not be a meaningful minority fork that appears after EIP-1559 goes live in London, there actually **cannot ever be** a meaningful minority fork of Ethereum thanks to the billions of dollars that are incentivizing the entire ecosystem to continue to run on one unified chain.",469.0,2021-04-14 14:52:47,0.98
Smart contract platforms should become rollups,"Riffing off this excellent post, an absolute must-read for anyone into crypto:  [Will we see a multi-chain world? - The Catalyst (substack.com)](https://dcinvestor.substack.com/p/will-we-see-a-multi-chain-world?r=18im0&utm_campaign=post&utm_medium=web&utm_source=twitter)

A smart contract blockchain can be broken down into two main components: the virtual machine on which applications are built and the consensus mechanism. For new platforms, consensus is very challenging, with highly centralized token distributions. Most smart contract platforms have opted for a delegated-type proof-of-stake solution where stakeholders vote for validators - essentially leading to plutocratic cabals over the long term. Needless to say, this has significant decentralization and security compromises. Of course, the delegated-type setups have evolved over the years. For example, Cardano, Cosmos and others improves on EOS/Steem by ""pre-bribing"" voters with ""staking rewards"" - although even in this case, further agreements can be made between validators and stakeholders over and above that. The likes of Polkadot and Tezos improve further by requiring validators to post a minimum number of tokens themselves, and adding slashing mechanisms. Yes, we do have non-delegated-type chains like Zilliqa and Lukso but they have their own challenges. These consensus mechanisms can be very expensive, typically requiring protocol inflation in the 5%-15% range.

What rollups allow is for smart contract platforms to build their own application layer, while simply contracting Ethereum to do the challenging consensus and data availability work. Ethereum brings massive economies of scale into play. The Merge is top priority post London, and soon we'll have Ethereum being secured by proof-of-stake. Unlike many of the delegated-type chains mentioned above, Ethereum uses ""real"" proof-of-stake, where validators are actually proving their own stake instead of others'. Combined with Ethereum's far more decentralized token distribution - thanks to running PoW for 6+ years, a higher market cap/larger economy, and executing significant economic activity on-chain ($20+ billion is settled on Ethereum everyday now!) - this means Ethereum's consensus mechanism can be several orders of magnitude more secure and decentralized than any newly minted chain. After The Merge happens, I expect around 500,000 validators securing Ethereum. (There are 115,000 already.) The overall inflation from proof-of-stake is capped at a maximum 2%, but very likely much lower, not even accounting for EIP-1559 fee burns. Yes, staking pool services and protocols will be built on top of Ethereum too, but they still have to run multiple validators for each 32 ETH stake, each validator still has an equal responsibility, and slashing mechanisms are a strong deterrence. I should note that as mentioned above, some chains do feature aspects of ""real"" proof-of-stake despite delegations - where at least portion of their validation is their own stake and slashing (like Polkadot, Tezos), or randomly selected validators (like Algorand), so there definitely are chains with some hybrid elements. Of course, there's always the possibility that some network comes up with an even better consensus mechanism - we can definitely have another discussion then.

What rollups can do now is to simply focus on building a world-class application-layer, potentially surpassing what any L1 VM can offer. Currently, we see application-specific rollups like ImmutableX, Loopring, zkSync, dYdX etc. offering massive scalability for specific purposes today. Gas is so low that these platforms are effectively zero gas, fees abstracted away from the end user. ImmutableX does \~9,600 TPS for minting NFTs, and they only have to pay $0.003 in gas to Ethereum L1. That is only $30 for all NFTs in existence today! Sure as hell a lot cheaper than building and paying or your own consensus mechanism. By focusing on the most efficient application layer possible, and contracting out security to Ethereum, they are able to outscale any L1 today, while not materially sacrificing decentralization either. Oh, and transactions are confirmed instantly. Overall, they offer an experience simply not possible on any L1 platform. Of course, we also have generalized rollups incoming shortly, like Optimistic Ethereum or zkEVM, where anyone can deploy smart contracts arbitrarily.

Rollups can also have their own token and economic incentives, their own clients, sequencers and provers etc. I'm just not seeing enough teams leveraging the potential here. Optimism, Arbitrum, zkSync 2.0 and StarkNet have a significant headstart, to be sure, but it's not too late to jump into what will likely be crypto's most intensely competitive field in the years to come.

There's plenty of room for innovation on the application layer with more efficient VMs, clients, programming languages, developer tooling etc. while at the same time letting Ethereum do the hard part of a highly decentralized and secure consensus mechanism and data layer. For example, zkSync 2.0's ZincVM is based on LLVM, which offers a fantastic alternative to L1 EVM for developers, and enables supporting programming languages like Rust. It's a win-win-win for all: platforms, developers and users. **At this point, building an alternate L1 is more hubris than reason.**

Well, with exceptions - when marketing can overpower the security weaknesses, and decentralization is no longer important. Currently, I see only two platforms that have achieved this - Binance Smart Chain and Flow. Both are leveraging very popular centralized platforms - Binance CEX and NBA Top Shots - to build a strong user base and network effects. Or, by building a strong niche - some smart contract platforms may have features not possible with rollups. One such example will be a highly centralized but highly performant chain like Solana which can potentially offer greater throughput than even Ethereum rollups - at least till data sharding releases in the next year or two - but at this level of centralization it's a complete different type of product anyway.

One last thing - addressing composability and interoperability. Nothing changes here, solutions for L1 <> L1 situation today can be extended to L2 <> L2 and L1 <> L2 communication. Indeed, it could be better than fragmented L1s, for example multiple L2 AMMs can use a common liquidity pool on L1. We have several projects with these type of solutions like Celer, Connext and Hop.

With all that said - which L1 do you think will be the first to pivot to being an ethereum rollup?

Rough estimate of validator rewards with fees,"I have been thinking about the rewards validators will earn from fees and the numbers can get really crazy if Ethereum keeps up the current network usage or exceeds it. I assume EIP1559 will burn half of the fees paid by the users.

32Eth \* Percent Rewards + Blocks Per Validator Per Year \* Fees per block = Earnings per year

0.035 Eth is half of the fees per block in april 2019

1 Eth is half of the fees per block currently

I sold all but $750 worth of ETH and moved it all into Algorand.,"My buy-in price for ETHEREUM was $234, and I bought nearly twenty in 2017. What convinced me to sell my ETH was these three events: I had to pay a one-time gas fee of $76 to put up three NFTs at OpenSea. Next, I'm not too fond of the idea that the NFT will be on two separate blockchains when ETH forks. What happens if they fork some more? Finally, I don't feel good about ETH politics with the miners. They are like a union. ETHEREUM 2.0 got an accelerated launch date because the miners talked about making a 51% attack on the coin.

I pick Algorand for it solved the ""trilemma."" No coin will do well with a anemic Transaction Per Second Speed (TPS) that ETH and BTC suffer. The ALGO team is like NASA compared to the majority of coins. To be honest and transparent, I am hopeful the FED Reserve and ECB will choose Algorand as their blockchain. Algorand is politically connected to the SEC and perhaps central banks. CBDCs\* will rule the space, and I hope ALGO will have the DAPPs necessary to make it accessible to the common person.

Ethereum Scalability Race - April 2021 update,"This is my personal perspective on the current status of scalability on Ethereum. Today, Ethereum is all-in on Layer 2 solutions. While there are different definitions for Layer 2, for the purpose of this post, I define it as solutions secured by Ethereum mainnet. This eliminates sidechains like xDai or Polygon, and focuses on rollups. (I will note that because Polygon checkpoints back to ethereum mainnet, so it's a grey area and still a better solution than any non-ethereum smart contract chain.) For an in-depth explanation of rollups, Vitalik's post is a must-read: [An Incomplete Guide to Rollups (vitalik.ca)](https://vitalik.ca/general/2021/01/05/rollup.html)

[DeverseFi](https://twitter.com/deversifi/status/1376537192621862912/photo/1) has a great banner listing some of the Layer 2 projects currently building on Ethereum, I'll cover some highlights from this list.

# Application-specific rollups

Currently, all rollups on mainnet are application-specific. Some of the exciting application-specific rollups are:

\- Loopring: Payments and DEX

\- zkSync: Payments

\- ImmutableX: NFT minting and exchange. Interestingly, ImmutableX will have multiple applications built on top of it that need to mint and exchange NFTs, such as Gods Unchained and OpenSea.

\- Aztec: Privacy payments. Like ImmutableX, Aztec could have multiple privacy payment applications. The first one currently live is [zk.money](https://zk.money)

All of these already do thousands of TPS, many offer gas-free interactions with the very low gas abstracted away from the user. For example, ImmutableX can do \~9,600 TPS, with each NFT mint costing $0.002 in gas, easily subsidized by the protocol as being effectively gas-free to the end user. Another important UX improvement is that transactions are confirmed effectively instantly. Do try these products (and more listed in the banner above) for a glimpse into the future of blockchain scalability.

# Generalized programmable rollups

Not every smart contract has the resources to build their own application-specific rollup. This is where a generalized, programmable, Turing-complete rollups enters the fray, where anyone can deploy their smart contracts, and as a result where most smart contracts will scale. It's a very interesting paradigm where there's intense competition to build the best execution environment on top of Ethereum. (Which is why I call it ""Scalability Race"".) 

**Optimistic Ethereum**: Limited mainnet since January 2021 (currently Synthetix only for staking), public testnet is now live though not officially supported till later in April. Public mainnet July 2021, although we expect ""whitelisted"" projects like Uniswap, Chainlink, MakerDAO to go live before then.

**Arbitrum**: An optimistic rollup and direct competition to Optimistic Ethereum. They are committed to a fully public release, and are currently on their release candidate public testnet. They have a crucial advantage over Optimistic Ethereum currently, with BLS signature aggregation.

**Fuel**: Also an optimistic rollup. Currently offers payments, but plans to expand into smart contracts later in 2021.

**zkSync 2.0**: Similar to Fuel, currently a payments protocol, expanding into generalized smart contract support. Unlike the above three, zkSync 2.0 is a ZK rollup, which brings the advantage of instant exits to L1. Public testnet: May 2021; public mainnet: August 2021.

**StarkNet**: Direct competitor to zkSync 2.0: a programmable ZK rollup. Scheduled for release in late 2021, though potentially accelerating thanks to an impressive $75 million Series B raise last month.

**Polygon**: Acknowledging the centralization flaws of their current sidechain, Polygon are also developing both ZK and optimistic rollups (among other solutions). No concrete dates I could find. My unsolicited recommendation for Polygon would be to abandon their currently announced kitchen-sink model and laser focus on delivering a world class generalized ZK rollup.

We might end up with a situation here where Ethereum L1 will only act as a settlement and security layer, with a majority of activity happening on rollups. Before we move on beyond rollups, I'd point out that there are multiple projects like Celer, Connext, or Hop that are focusing on interoperability between L1 <> L2 and L2 <> L2.

# Enhancements to application-layer

The application-layer (previously called eth1) protocol, EVM and clients continue to mature. For example, EIP-2929 mitigates DoS attacks and could lead to a minor bump in gas limit. EIP-1559 has strong UX implications that \*might\* mitigate users overpaying for gas, and smooth out spikes. There's no one big upgrade here, but a continuous series of enhancements that'll enable higher gas limits over time. As an example, while I was writing this, Vitalik has published an [intriguing proposal](https://ethresear.ch/t/make-eip-1559-more-like-an-amm-curve/9082) to further improve EIP-1559. For context, many of these improvements have enabled Ethereum's gas limit to increase from 4M in 2017 to 12.5M today. Eventually, we may even get back to eWASM (?).

# Data sharding / data availability sampling (DAS)

DAS is focused on accelerating rollups by offering massive data availability in a granular manner over 64 shards. Where an efficient rollup can do anywhere between 1,000 TPS to 4,500 TPS today, DAS will accelerate this to potentially over 50,000-100,000 TPS. Gas-efficient rollups like ImmutableX will potentially be accelerated past 200,000 TPS. Previously, this was set to ship before The Merge, but is now coming after The Merge, potentially later in 2022 or early 2023. By the way, The Merge itself does not lead to scalability upgrades, but we could see related [proposals to increase gas limit](https://ethresear.ch/t/commit-to-pre-state-instead-of-post-state-on-the-executable-beacon-chain/8802) after The Merge.

# Statlessness / state expiry

Incredibly, we have gotten this far without actually increasing L1 scalability significantly. L1 gas is going to remain high for the near future - get used to it. This may not matter too much if we have massive scalability on L2, though, as that's where most users will be. L1 will act more of a settlement layer for the bigger players - rollups, exchanges, financial institutions, whales etc.

However, with statelessness / state expiry, this is finally being addressed - L1 gas limits will see significant increases without materially sacrificing decentralization & security. It's still early days, but we finally have some [concrete options available](https://hackmd.io/@vbuterin/state_expiry_paths). We don't have a date here, but personally I wouldn't expect this before 2023.

# Executable sharding

What was previously Phase 2 has now been pushed back given the better solutions now available. Pretty crazy to think rollups did not even exist when sharding was first conceived as a scalability solution! This is where the shards no longer just offering data availability for rollups, but are also able to execute transactions themselves. It's hard to imagine how this will turn out - if rollups attain critical mass and statelessness allows for a significant enough gas limit uptick, we may not even require executable shards at all and it would be better to focus on enhancing (or increasing) data shards, for example. Or, it could be that we only require a smaller number of executable shards. Definitely the most nebulous step here, and something that'll only become clear over time.

# Hybrid scalability

I definitely believe that we'll see all kinds of hybrid solutions going forward, with various degrees of decentralization over multiple layer. Visa and [Crypto.com](https://Crypto.com) are effectively acting as scalability sidechains for Ethereum, though with a significant degree of centralization. What we might see in the future is that Visa cuts out [Crypto.com](https://Crypto.com) and goes directly to a rollup/L2 wallet/service provider. Likewise, I can also see Reddit build their own rollup, which keeps a lot of data on their centralized servers, and only settles the important stuff on mainnet. We already have such solutions today: for example DeverseFi uses Validium where less critical data like order books (?) are maintained on centralized servers, while all transactions and balances are on-chain. It could even apply for a [mainstream application like Fortnite](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/midbun/daily_general_discussion_april_2_2021/gt4e4a6).

Alright, that probably ended up much longer than I expected, but hopefully it will be informational because there's a lot of misinformation flying around in the crypto space. Feel free to add/correct things and I'll update the post accordingly.",179.0,2021-04-04 15:56:15,0.98
🔥 Today is the day some miners threatened to 51% attack Ethereum. AND THEY FAILED!!,"https://cointelegraph.com/news/ethereum-miners-plot-hash-power-show-of-force-against-eip-1559

Some very lame miners with no vision for the future threatened to attack us today out of pure greed.

They [gained some traction](https://www.reddit.com/r/EtherMining/comments/lzwq37/everyone_move_there_hash_to_ethermine_april_1st/) and Vitalik even wrote an article on avoiding such attacks and planned for a [rushed ETH2 plan](https://our.status.im/vitalik-escalates-eth-2-0-merge-as-miners-plan-a-51-attack/).

"Opinion: Time to sunset the ""Ethereum 2.0"" branding (and just call then ""Ethereum upgrades""?)","I'm sure we've all heard ""Ethereum 2.0 / ETH2.0 is years away"", ""ETH 2.0 is Ethereum's last shot at lowering gas fees"", ""Competitors are delivering ETH2.0 features today"", ""Eth 2.0 is the next version of Ethereum"", ""Ethereum 2.0 is a new chain that will replace the current chain and lead to massive headaches for developers and users"", so on and so forth. Of course, none of this is true, but understandable given the misleading Ethereum 2.0 branding. Danny Ryan has spoken about this vocally, and we've seen EF researchers start calling what was eth1 and eth2 application-layer and consensus-layer respectively. While this is an elegant and accurate nomenclature for developers, researchers and enthusiasts, it's still confusing to the average user and investor. 

Now, I don't quite grasp the black magic that is marketing, so perhaps some of you will have a better suggestion. What we want to do is shift the narrative and just consider all of it one Ethereum, with no ""next version"". Instead, we have an incremental set of upgrades that are rolling out regularly in the next 2-3 years. 

Arguably, the significant upgrades coming in the foreseeable future to Ethereum are rollups, EIP-1559, The Merge, data sharding, and statelessness; with several minor upgrades. As an example, even a ""minor"" application-layer upgrade like EIP-2929 will potentially enable a small bump in the gas limit, and thus have a greater direct impact on L1 gas than the major big upcoming consensus-layer upgrades - proof-of-stake and data sharding. 

It shouldn't matter to the average user which layer of Ethereum is upgraded - only that Ethereum is being upgraded frequently and what each upgrades do.",33.0,2021-04-01 06:07:31,0.81
The Ethereum Value Proposition: Store of Value Edition,"In the same vein as last week's post regarding the overall value proposition behind Ethereum, this is an easy to understand noob- friendly follow-up focusing specifically on the scarcity and therefore **store of value** that is coming and is now being created on Ethereum. 
.


**Locked up ETH** The total supply of ETH is about 115 million ETH in circulation. Currently the issuance rate (new ETH being created) is about 4% or so a year (so about 4.6 million ETH give or take). 

Per DefiPulse, the top 20 Dapps are currently locking up 11.2 million ETH 

Per Ethereumprice.org, 3.62 million ETH is already locked up in staking.

Grayscale Trusts also currently hold 3.17 million ETH total. (calculated from their total ETHE shares outstanding x 0.01023339 ETH per share)

Between these 3 sources alone we currently have about 17.91 million ETH locked up or 15.5% of the total supply that is virtually locked up and effectively removed from circulation.

**In layman's terms that means about 1 out of every 6 ETH is locked up and not for sale**

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Projections for ETH Lock up Growth** The amount of ETH locked is only going to continue to grow, and here's why:

**DEFI** a year ago had less than $200 million TOTAL locked up across all dapps. Today? It has over 43 billion and growing. Thats over a 215x increase in a year (taking into account the $ increase in ETH in the past year we are looking at over a 20x in the amount of ETH locked up in DEFI). As Ethereum scales in the next few months, it will become cheaper and easier for regular people to lock up their ETH and interact more with dapps so expect this 43 billion to grow a lot more. If in the last year DEFI did over a 20x in TVL (total value locked up), expecting a 2-3x in a year from the current levels would be reasonably conservative in my opinion. 

**What this means is, we could could see anywhere from 22-33 Million ETH locked up in the next year or 19 to 29% of the total supply locked up in DEFI alone.**

.

**Staking** And then there is staking. To keep it short and sweet, currently the vast majority of stakers are people that have the technical knowledge/savviness to boot up their own nodes and maintain the hardware 24/7, and that number is currently sitting around 3.62 million.

Once Coinbase launches ETH 2 support (they already added the coin to their dashboard last week signaling it may be coming very soon) since Coinbase has the largest userbase for crypto, we could very easily see millions more ETH being staked in the coming months once their waitlist is live. Rocketpool is also in its final testnet and will allow people to stake just as easily as coinbase but in a decentralized way, which will be an industry first. 
When these 2 options go live, because in the eyes of many it will be as easy as the click of a button to get ""passive income"", I could easily see the 3.62 million figure double to over 7 million ETH staked.

**That means conservatively over 6% of the total supply could be locked up in the coming months once Coinbase and Rocketpool are live**

I am not going to speculate on the specifics of whether Grayscale's trust will grow or not, but I assume as we see growing interest across all of  crypto, their fund or others like it will likely see a growing demand for ETH also. 

**So if you are keeping track, taking into account the growth in DEFI, Staking, and the current levels of Grayscale, we could be looking at 32-43 Million ETH locked up in the next year. 

**On average, that would mean about 1 in 3 ETH would be locked up and not for sale in one year's time**

*(43+32)/2 =37.5/115 = 32.6% ETH locked*

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**EIP 1559 and the ETH Burn Rate** EIP 1559 is going to burn the BASE FEE of every ETH transaction effectively putting deflationary pressure on the supply of ETH.

ETH's daily transactions for 3/29/21 per Etherscan were about 1.27 Million. 

Bitcoin's daily transactions for the same day were about 307,000. 

**That means that ETH is now processing 4x the amount of daily transactions as Bitcoin**

As these transactions grow so will the amount of ETH being burned once EIP 1559 is implemented in July.

Noone knows exactly how much the BASE FEE will be that will be burned, but per Vitalik's tweet on sept 15 2019: 

 ""Or if EIP 1559 is implemented the bulk of the txfees get burned directly”

Since it is now being implemented, we can assume conservatively that when he says the ""bulk"" of the transaction fees will be burned that that means at least 51%.

Some simple math can help us estimate the amount of ETH that will be burned:

Per Etherscan 03/29/21 stats:

Average Transaction Fee: $17.01

Total Transactions: 1,269,901

Total Transaction Fees on 03/29/21: $21,601,016.01

.

Assuming 51% of that total would be burned : 51% x 21.6M = ~$11 Million burned daily or @ETH at 1840 about 6,000 ETH would be burned daily. 

The current rate of ETH being produced daily is about 14,000 so that means we would cut the net issuance of ETH roughly by HALF in a short time AKA by this calculation **EIP 1559 would be an instant halvening for Ethereum**
.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
**Full Proof of Stake**
And then there's the icing on the cake.
On the recent Ethereum Dev Calls, the devs have said they want to expedite the Merge to full POS and it may come as early as this fall.

That means ETH will be full proof of stake with no miners and at that point ETH issuance would be under 1% annually. 

**That means if you combine EIP 1559's burn rate, and the move to POS, ETH issuance will be near 0 or deflationary**

This stance has also been corroborated by others such as Eric @econoar in a Sept 24 2019 tweet where he says after EIP 1559 and POS ""the network would be operating securely at near 0 issuance""

This is the real diamond in the rough that is not being factored in. 

**What this means is that once POS is live, and EIP 1559 is live, ETH will have lower inflation than Bitcoin**

ETH will also have many more use cases and utility compared to Bitcoin

**So what happens when you have a highly scarce asset that is also highly useful?**

It doesnt take an Elon Musk to figure that one out....

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
.

I could go on with more reasons but you get it....
**ETH has a very likely and strong chance to become very scarce very quickly**

**So why am I telling you all this?** Well Im glad you asked. Because if you liked the content for a limited time, if you are one of the first 100 users, I am selling a.........no.

I am telling you this because I believe in the Ethereum ecosystem and the decentralized future and as a young professional, I believe it is one of the most valuable opportunities in my lifetime. Thats it. Dont like it and want to call me a scammer or shill for some reason? Send a letter to my imaginary HR department. Otherwise, agree or disagree I dont care.

At the end of the day, like I said before, do whatever you want. 

Hope this helps those of you who are just now learning about the space and seeing what crypto and Ethereum is all about. 

Good luck and may the gains be with you.",870.0,2021-03-31 16:54:12,0.94
Gamestop & The NFT Opportunity,"[Gamestop](https://www.businessinsider.com/ryan-cohen-gamestop-transformation-ecommerce-explained-2021-3) To The Moon With NFT Rocket Fuel

Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) are blowing up. Everyone is making one; from William Shatner to Patrick Mahomes to the NBA. Given how hot the space is right now, I expect that more and more companies will look at selling them; including Gamestop.

Given that Ryan Cohen is refocusing Gamestop's sales efforts to e-commerce and digital, selling and facilitating the sale of NFTs only makes sense. Digital games are moving more into the NFT space while  Funko has recently announced that they intend to move into the NFT space. NFTs allow a company to merge the physical (say a rare physical item) with digital (a rare NFT) in a packaged sale.

This posts starts by first outlining recent news in the NFT space, then moving to NFTs in video games, and then finally talking a bit about Funko.

NON-FUNGIBLE TOKENS: RECENT ANNOUNCEMENTS & HIGHLIGHTS

A non-fungible token ([NFT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-fungible_token)) is a digital file whose unique identity and ownership are verified on a blockchain (a digital ledger). NFTs are not mutually interchangeable. NFTs are commonly created by uploading files, such as digital artwork, to an auction market. This creates copies of the files, which are recorded as NFTs on the digital ledger. The tokens can then be bought with cryptocurrency and resold. (From Wikipedia)

While NFT's have been around for several years, but have been more recently getting significantly more publicity as the NBA has created their own version of NFT trading cards and digital artists have been selling their works on the blockchain for large sums.

It is expected that many more companies and IP rights holders will move into the space ([Here](https://www.businessinsider.com/nba-top-shot-vc-says-disney-harry-potter-to-join-nfts-2021-3)). The Compound had an interesting discussion on NFTs and the history of collectibles ([Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLzkDRLADIc)).

Highlights of recent NFT milestones and news events:

· Beeple is the poster child of the trend right now as he recently sold his art NFT for $69 million ([Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkutviCrpvA), [Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HjI9dGdeKP0))

· NBA launches NBA Top Shots where people can buy NFTs highlights of basketball plays. This guy turned $175k into $20 million in value. ([Here](https://www.wsj.com/articles/nba-top-shot-nft-crypto-digital-collectibles-11615266042), [Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-l47ktffbQ&t=1s), & [Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vp7-g_7iY-k&t=7s))

· CryptoKitties can sell for thousands or more ([Here](https://medium.com/cryptokitties/understanding-the-cryptokitties-marketplace-f0a6f32ac090))

· Investment funds are being created to invest in NFTs ([Here](https://markets.businessinsider.com/currencies/news/what-are-risks-of-investing-in-nft-2021-3-1030187329))

· DC Comics tells artists not to create NFTs based on their IP while it researches the space; suggesting that DC Comics may already have NFT deals pending announcement or in negotiations ([Here](https://io9.gizmodo.com/dc-comics-tells-artists-to-stay-out-of-nft-business-or-1846466427)). Including a recent Batman statue tied to the blockchain. ([Here](https://www.gamesradar.com/batman-leads-dc-into-nft-crypto-art/))

Given the amount of publicity and momentum for NFTs recently, there is no doubt that they'll be a hot topic in the news in 2021 and probably beyond. Those that get in early may be rewarded handsomely.

NFTs IN THE VIDEO GAMES SPACE

Video games are an excellent fit with NFTs because the blockchain allows one to assign rights to digital items easily and quickly. Items like weapons, cars, real estate, clothes, whatever can be assigned an NFT and then monetized within a game. That NFT purchase could then allow a user to move their item from one place to another online. From e-sports to mobile games the impact could be massive.

Highlights of recent NFT news events in the games space:

· Sandbox, a UGC world like Roblox, recently sold more than $1 million worth of virtual land in apart of the game sponsored by Atari

· Polyient Games purchased a citadel in the Mirandus fantasy game for more than $800,000.

· Yield Guild Games purchased 88 plots of Savannah land in Axie Infinity and a 12-by-12 estate in Sandbox. The combined price was over $100,000.

· Illuvium has raised $5 million to create a fantasy-based video game with NFTs. The game rewards players with the opportunity to explore and capture NFT creates in combat. It incentivizes players with a stake in the project; as fees incurred within the game are paid out to staked token holders as ongoing rewards. ([Here](https://venturebeat.com/2021/03/11/illuviam-raises-5-million-for-nft-based-fantasy-battle-game/))

Some quotes about NFTs in video games:

“Gaming is going to be big. People spend a lot of money in games. When they quit a game, that money is gone. Your investment is gone. It doesn’t mean anything. So if people are willing to spend that kind of money in something where if they stopped logging in, it has no value. What happens when, if they stop logging in, they sell what they bought. It will change the whole nature of video games. It won’t be spending anymore. It will be investing. So it totally changes everything.” Gabe Leydon - Founder CEO of [Machine Zone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_Zone)

""If you own a piece of property in a game, you no longer have to pay rent on it every month, and you can think of it as an investment. You could make money when you sell it."" - [Dean Takahasi](https://venturebeat.com/author/dean-takahashi/)

“If you can play for something that is valuable to you, then why would you choose to play in a game where there is no value. We are not saying traditional games will go away. But we do believe in this thesis that it’s better for the player to play in an environment when you have some ownership.” - Yat Siu - Founder of [Animoca Brands](https://venturebeat.com/2019/08/07/animoca-brands-buys-quidd-for-up-to-8-million-as-it-moves-into-blockchain-collectibles/)

""In the past, players were more like serfs, working for the lord of the estate. These walled gardens generate money for the game company, and its shareholders, but nothing goes to the players. Those walled gardens could make the rules and kick out the players who broke the rules. And the players didn’t get to take the things they bought with them when they left. Now, if a game shuts down, the player can’t take their assets and move to another game."" - [Dean Takahasi](https://venturebeat.com/author/dean-takahashi/)

""In a game, I could buy an NFT that memorializes my completion of Red Dead Redemption 2, where it captures everything I did in the game and follows my unique path through it. I could show that to people, maybe, sometime in the future and recount it with pride. I would pay for that."" - Yat Siu - Founder of [Animoca Brands](https://venturebeat.com/2019/08/07/animoca-brands-buys-quidd-for-up-to-8-million-as-it-moves-into-blockchain-collectibles/)

“It’s more about the fact that the value of the assets are part of the experience. What makes it valuable as a collectible is that it’s an emotional and cultural moment. I can go deeper into the experience, and the more connected I become to it. I can express myself, and have a sword with 50 kills on it, or maybe it’s something my son used, and we had a great moment with it. We’ve just scratched the surface of that. - Yat Siu - Founder of [Animoca Brands](https://venturebeat.com/2019/08/07/animoca-brands-buys-quidd-for-up-to-8-million-as-it-moves-into-blockchain-collectibles/)

“Within the generations or the family where that item is held, it is priceless. And this is a power of non-fungible tokens because every object has some scarcity. It’s like your wedding ring. It’s not that valuable to others, but yours is your dream, your story.”  - Yat Siu - Founder of [Animoca Brands](https://venturebeat.com/2019/08/07/animoca-brands-buys-quidd-for-up-to-8-million-as-it-moves-into-blockchain-collectibles/)

FUNKO MOVING INTO NFTs “FAIRLY SOON”

Last Friday Funko's CEO Brian Mariotti was [interviewed](https://finance.yahoo.com/video/funko-ceo-ability-disrupt-nft-151936943.html) by Yahoo Finance:

“We’re excited about it and we have a plan in place. We have some technology in place. We are going to be out in the market fairly soon. But we’re going to out in the market in a very different way. We have the ability to disrupt this space in a way that nobody else is doing right now. We can tie digital NFT’s to our fan base and link NFT’s with physical products. And that’s not happening right now. So, for example, if you had a pack of NFT’s. I won’t mention licenses. And there are a few rare ones. If you have those rare ones, we’re going to give you a free product that is tied to that rare NFT. Which means you have a super rare physical product that ties to your super rare NFT. That’s disruptive. That’s new. It’s different. It’s only what Funko can do. And we’re really excited about what the future of NFT’s are. We’re certainly all over this. And I think you’ll see fairly soon from Funko in the market.”

Funko seems to have the NFT market clearly in its sights and Gamestop could be a potential beneficiary. Imagine Gamestop selling Funko NFT's online and fulfilling in-store. Or having Gamestop exclusive Funko NFT's combined with rare Funko Pops!. Gamestop could even sell NFT's for Loungefly; Funko's fashion-related business that sells things like backpacks and wallets ([Disney Bag 1](https://www.ebay.com/itm/Disney-Cast-Member-Exclusive-LE-600-Mickey-90th-Anniversary-Loungefly-Backpack/353336689947?hash=item524482051b:g:hj4AAOSwTu9fyDep), [Disney Bag 2](https://www.ebay.com/itm/NWT-Disney-Loungefly-Sleeping-Beauty-DEC-Employee-Backpack/373488324364?hash=item56f5a38f0c:g:eWIAAOSw3qVgRW30)).

How Gamestop and Funko might capitalize on the NFT trend:

· Digital items have the ability to move globally in an instant; increasing the total addressable market. Both for Funko and for collectors. (Imagine how easy it would be for Gamestop to expand into other international markets they are not currently in through NFTs)

· All collectibles and art have concerns with fakes and counterfeits. By using blockchain technology and NFT’s, Funko and Gamestop can reduce the impact of counterfeiters on their businesses. When someone purchases a rare item, its NFT can serve as certification of its authenticity through the blockchain.

· NFT’s allow Funko and Gamestop to move to blockchain based payment systems and tap wealthy investors looking to diversify out of their crypto coin holdings into physical and digital items. Especially wealthy crypto investors who are looking to park their money in other investments to diversify their portfolio.

· NFT “artists” or “creators” can collect a piece of the revenue each time the specific digital asset turns over. For example, an NFT can be sold 20 times over the course of a year. Each time the NFT is sold the owner and seller can collect a fee (depending on how the system were structured).",25.0,2021-03-15 04:37:13,0.73
Some technical proposals that were considered for the ethereum protocol but never made it in: a history,"There have been a lot of protocol changes that have been suggested for Ethereum. Some were implemented quickly, others were implemented after many refinements, and still others were forgotten because of disinterest or because they proved to create more problems than they solve. Some of these ideas may be best left for dead, but others, after improvements, perhaps _could_ make it in after all (though after high-priority stuff like merge, statelessness and EIP 1559). Here's a few examples of ideas that were once considered and are now ignored.

#### Asynchronous calling

In the earlier stages of Ethereum's development (pre-launch), there was an opcode that was proposed called POST. A POST is equivalent to a CALL, except instead of the call happening _immediately_, the call happens at the end of thee transaction. It was abandoned because of pressure to launch on time and because there was not enough obvious value for it. Later on in 2016-18, there were serious discussions about revamping the VM in the context of sharding, and one of the ideas on the table was to make _all_ calls asynchronous. This too was abandoned, as the sharding design moved to a maximally-simple MVP: just make many copies of the existing EVM and give them a simple (by necessity asynchronous) channel to talk to each other, but allow synchronous execution within shards. Demand for ""defi composability"" further closed the door on this, and Ethereum moving to an all-asynchronous model now seems very unlikely.

#### Transparent sharding with automated load balancing

Transparent sharding is a form of sharding where contracts would not even be able to tell which shard they are on, and contracts could be moved between shards by the protocol. The protocol would automatically move contracts between shards to ensure that the load on each shard remains about the same. This was also abandoned in response to remands for sharding to be simplified so that it could ship faster; additionally, it was never clear why this kind of sharding is better than ""economic load balancing"", where contracts themselves could hop between shards if they choose to, and users would naturally migrate to shards with lower gas costs and thereby help balance out the load.

#### Delayed calls

In early 2015, an opcode called ALARM was also proposed. This opcode would also do a call, except the call would execute in some future block. This has many use cases; for example, withdrawals from rollups could finalize automatically, users who put their funds into bids at auctions could get their funds back when the time expires, etc. There are also applications for censorship resistance: a user could publish a transaction with an ALARM call, where the effect of the transaction depended on some _other_ behavior that the user knew would happen between transaction sending time and alarm execution time, and block producers would not be able to censor it, MEV bots would not be able to manipulate it, etc.

This proposal was shelved out of pressure to launch faster, and we later learned that there actually is a lot of unforeseen technical complexity in making this work well. Particularly, imagine that all blocks `[N ... N + 99999]` make an ALARM call that triggers in block `N + 100000`. This would cause a _huge_ spike in gas usage in that block. Solving this problem seems to require some notion of being able to pre-purchase gas of a future block, where the supply that can be pre-purchased is limited, but in principle it can be done.

### SSTORE arbitrary-sized objects into one slot

[This proposal](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/97) was made with the goal of increasing efficiency and code simplicity, allowing users to save longer objects (strings, code...) into single storage slots, without the contract having to do a loop to split it up in many storage slots and without the Ethereum blockchain having to do all the extra hashing work of including many storage slots instead of one. The proposal was abandoned because it turns out that the complexity of figuring out gas costs for such a scheme is high, there may be database issues, and generally it adds very significant protocol complexity. Recent ideas are trying to go in the _opposite_ direction, turning the one type of long contiguous storage that we do have (code) [into a tree](https://medium.com/ewasm/evm-bytecode-merklization-2a8366ab0c90)!

### Parallelizable execution

[EIP 648](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/648) tried to add support for parallelizable execution, where transactions could specify which portions of the state they touch, and if two transactions touched disjoint parts of the state they could be processed in parallel. If we assume that Ethereum clients are multithreaded (most modern computers are), then this could significantly increase scalability. The proposal was shelved in part because it turns out that VM execution is not even the biggest bottleneck in limiting the safe amount of gas in a block (disk accesses and state size are), and even if we implemented it, Ethereum nodes would still become heavier and more difficult to run. However, the proposal is theoretically completely viable, and optimistic rollup projects are considering implementing it for the more high-performance-oriented EVM environments within their rollups!",268.0,2021-03-13 21:25:09,0.99
Calling on Miner Community to Contribute to Updating EIP-969 That Bricks ASICS,"As you may or may not be aware the 969 champion has dropped out due to legal pressure and we are required to submit a new EIP. Due to legal threats this is being submitted anonymously and championed anonymously (by me unless someone else who is better able to wants to volunteer). 969 is a middle ground that allows GPU mining to remain profitable post 1559 as we would be unable to compete with ASICS after 1559 lowers block rewards (they have lower power costs per hash, higher hashrates per cost, and lower cost of power). Vitalik has said that he will support this but we need to make several good points to convince the community to get onboard. 

To do so we require 969 (that is now 3 years old) to be updated. I am asking the mining community to contribute in the comments below (or msg me if you wish to remain anonymous). I will assemble the original 969 and the comments below into a new EIP. I need this to be ready by Saturday as we need to make the next meeting for inclusion with the London fork.

[EIP-969 is here](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-969.md)

Main areas that need to be updated:
1. The areas surrounding “why the change?” - It needs to be justified it can’t just be about increasing GPU miner profits. Basically why are ASICS a threat that needs to be acted on today. Please try to provide stats and resources emotional arguments or ones without sources aren’t much help. 

2. The technique for accomplishing the fork, likely need to merge some commits from the already completed 1057/ethash 2.0/progpow implementation that are responsible for using a different pow version after a certain block.

If you are able to contribute or know someone that is able to please do so/let them know. Thank you.

Please note that the April 1st action hurts our efforts to reach a settlement with the core development team. It is not necessarily a hostile relationship and they appear willing to give us 969 if that settles opposition. However, we are required to follow their EIP process. BBT is submitting an EIP to ask for a block reward increase and I would like us all to work on an EIP to remove ASICS from ETH as the original white paper calls for. ASICS were 40%+ of hashrate before the 4gb DAG and they will takeover the network again after 1559. Many core developers are pro-miner but they got badly burned during Ethash 2.0/Progpow thanks to ASIC companies throwing large amounts of money and flak at them. This is our last chance to eliminate ASIC and keep them off our network.

PS: I appreciate all the moral support but I do need help writing this so please list sources on your arguments for why ASICS should be bricked. And this has to be about why it’s better for eternueum not why it’s better for GPU mining. Think about how we can convince an ETH holder to want to do business with GPU miners instead of ASIC farms. How does bricking ASICS benefit them?",897.0,2021-03-12 04:20:54,0.97
Misconceptions Regarding Dogecoin FAQ V1.3,"This is a revised version of my previous article. I am going to try to update frequently. 

Version 1.3 has the following changes
- Shortened some questions, removed others and added others based on feedback from the community 
- Updated some of the spelling errors and minor typos. 

This information below is important. I ask that you please take the time to read this entire post before making judgment or commenting. My discord group helped me create this FAQ on the majority of the most asked questioned and misunderstandings regarding Dogecoin, into the following key points. Even if you know the answers to some of these please read the entire post. The information builds upon each other to explain some of the more questions near the end. 

1. Question: What is Dogecoin?

Answer: Dogecoin (/ˈdoʊdʒkɔɪn/ DOHJ-koyn, code: DOGE, symbol: Ð) is a cryptocurrency invented by software engineers Billy Markus and Jackson Palmer, who decided to create a payment system that is instant, fun, and free from traditional banking fees. Dogecoin features the face of the Shiba Inu dog from the popular ""Doge"" meme as its logo and namesake. It was introduced on December 6, 2013, and quickly developed its own online community reaching a market capitalization of US $5,382,875,000 on January 28, 2021. [Wikipedia, 20210203]

2.  Question: Why Dogecoin?

Answer: For the Lolz. Well, not quite. Initially as a purely meme-driven alternative to the likes of Bitcoin and Litecoin, Dogecoin in-fact boasts very low transaction fees and fast transaction times, very little network congestion, and most importantly, is designed to be used as a daily means of exchange, like your morning cup of coffee. Also, it is really fun, and who doesn't like the Dog ?!
		
1/2 - second perspective) Question: What Is Dogecoin? And why Dogecoin?

Answer: Back a few years ago, some crazy people banded together in support of a cryptocurrency known as Dogecoin. Similar to other cryptocurrencies, Dogecoin, the people's crypto, finds itself with the support of hundreds if not thousands of individuals pushing for this currency to succeed. But why is that? Unless you have been absent from every social bubble, you may have heard of Bitcoin. For the purpose of this explanation, you will find that Bitcoin is not exactly an easy thing to equate to Dogecoin, but lets think about the criteria of a Cryptocurrency.Bitcoin did not find its foothold overnight. In fact, it took several years. A lot of people fought tooth and nail for their belief in the coin. Crypto, in a nutshell, is a decentralized form of currency that finds its value in a combination of individual asset involvement, ease or difficulty in security of an exchange, creating a method of reliable, secure, trustworthy exchange, and other reasons. 

Think of it like this: to exchange goods and services without currency, one must barter. I can barter a service (a haircut, for example) towards someone who needs a haircut, and in exchange they can barter a good or service to me.Currency then becomes an ""IOU"" (I Owe yoU) so that, if somebody needs me to cut their hair, they can give me an IOU for a good or service they control. When enough people begin adopting this, a centralized currency eventually takes hold. Crypto seeks to take this a step further and, instead of relying on building up a centalization in terms of valuable metals or debt, it is built up solely on the exchange of goods and services. Dogecoin, compared to other cryptocurrencies, finds itself in a strange position where the origins did NOT see it soaring to the moon in any situation. Funny how things can change in time. Dogecoin has pros and cons to it. Comparing it to other cryptos, it does not face a supply cap like Bitcoin does. It is not a directly equated asset, such as how Bitcoin can be attributed as a digital gold asset. Mining dogecoin is also much simpler (comparitively) and does not face difficulty spikes, a source of Bitcoin slow-down. In essence, in 50 years, Dogecoin will still be around, still be mined, still be traded. Bitcoin will cease to be created, hoarded, and become the digital currency of the affluent.

3. Question: Places to buy dogecoin places where you can spend Dogecoin? 

Answer: Refer to r/dogecoin posts by the moderators for a list of businesses that accept doge as payment. 

4. Question: Cryptocurrencies vs stocks. The main differences between them. 
		
Answer:  
A stock is a type of investment that represents an ownership share in a company. Investors buy stocks that they think will go up in value over time. ... A stock is an investment. When you purchase a company's stock, you're purchasing a small piece of that company, called a share. 

A cryptocurrency:  (crypto for short) is a digital a sset designed to work as a medium of exchange wherein individual coin ownership records are stored in a ledger existing in a form of computerized database using strong cryptography to secure transaction records, to control the creation of additional coins, and to verify the transfer of coin ownership. It typically does not exist in physical form (like paper money) and is typically not issued by a central authority. Cryptocurrencies typically use decentralized control as opposed to centralized digital currency and central banking systems. When a cryptocurrency is minted or created prior to issuance or issued by a single issuer, it is generally considered centralized. When implemented with decentralized control, each cryptocurrency works through distributed ledger technology, typically a blockchain, that serves as a public financial transaction database.

When comparing crypto to stocks, the main thing to keep in mind is that cryptocurrencies have few if any regulations applied to them. It is still the ""wild west"" of trading. You can be scammed, skimmed, pumped-dumped, as so forth, much more often and more easily than with stocks. Terminology is similar to exact between the two, but both require a certain mindset. Crypto is almost always a long-haul game, where stocks can be short play or long haul. Cryptocurrency is literally money. Cryptocurrencies intended purpose is to use it to exchange goods and services. The way paper money is. 

5. Question: Difference between cold storage, internet wallets and Robinhood/exchanges

Answer: 
Coldstorage - in the cryptocurrency world cold storage refers to physical objects/devices that contain your cryptocurrency. 

Wallets are an electronic program of service that stores your cryptocurrency. There a number of different wallets - but I personally use Dogecoin.info

Exchanges - an exchange is a company that holds a large sum of cryptocurrency - this case Dogecoin. They exchange fiat currency (paper money) for cryptocurrency. When you have your money on an exchange it is in the custody of the exchanges wallet until you transfer it to your personal wallet. Through legally binding user agreements you do technically own the coins, however in order to use your cryptocurrency you need to have it in your personal wallet. The same way you can’t use money in the bank - you have to cash out by withdrawing your money. Certain exchanges allow withdraw - others do not. Robhinhood currently doesn’t allow withdraws, but they are working on making this happen. 

If you would like to help increase the speed at which Robhinhood adds their withdraw feature read my article here:

https://www.reddit.com/r/dogecoin/comments/llaj7t/about_robhinhood_better_solution_than_selling_and/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf

6. Question: Is Dogecoin a meme or should it be taken seriously? 

Answer: We have all witnessed the power of a meme, the depths it can reach in society, especially in recent years. We have seen it many times before with video games, consoles, Oreos, or as of late even toilet paper... A meme has inherent value in the form of “widespread information”. A meme can spread an idea across diverse communities, and even entire countries literally overnight. This can bring about lasting effects on culture and society. If correctly taken advantage of, Doge can become the dominant meme currency of the internet, and amass real-world value just by being a popular, recognisable meme itself. This is where the saying “Dogecoin is the people’s coin” comes from. This is marketing 101. If your idea, or product is too complicated or not enough people know about then it doesn’t matter how technologically sound it is. Dogecoin have the best technology? No. Can it be improved upon. Definitely. In fact, the original developers have started working on the project again. An analogy I like to use is this. McDonald’s makes hamburgers. They have a clown as a mascot. A literal personification of a joke. Does make McDonald’s make the best hamburgers? No. Does McDonald’s have “value” in their industry? Undeniably so. So what does McDonald’s do correctly? They provide a cheap, easily accessible, and brand able product to the masses. Which is what dogecoin does for cryptocurrency. 

7. Question: Does Dogecoin have value? How does Dogecoin increase in price or decrease in price? 

Answer: Yes. Dogecoin has value. If didn’t have value then it wouldn’t be bought or sold at all. Anything can have value as long as enough people assign it value and agree to it. The value of any means of exchange is fundamentally driven by supply and demand. If two parties agree that X amount of asset A is roughly worth the same as Y amount of asset B, you effectively have established a market.  That’s why the US dollar and other fiat currency has value even though it just a piece of paper. The difference between fiat currency and cryptocurrency is that fiat currency is determined by centralized government and other underlying economical/market conditions. Cryptocurrency is meant to be a decentralized form of fiat currency. Now as to why the price changes from say .05 to .06 (random numbers using this as an example for explanation purposes. It is not exact) this value is driven primarily by supply and demand. We already know the supply of Dogecoin, so for the purpose of this the main driving factor in the change in price is demand. But the demand for Dogecoin isn’t just one person. It’s the entire group of people who own Dogecoin. So if at any given time lets say 10 people with 1000 Dogecoin want to sell. But only 5 people want to buy 1000 Dogecoin. This means that the sellers “value” Dogecoin less at its current price than buyers do. 5000 Dogecoin less. This changes to price from .05 to .49. The same applies if more people wanted to buy. Then the price would go from .05 to .051. An algorithm repeats the process over and over constantly updating the price. However that’s only one way to change the value. The best way to increase the overall value of the currency in the long run is by eventually by exchanging your coins for goods, services, or just by tipping and trading with other Dogecoin holders. This gives Dogecoin utility. Which basically means that it can be used for something other than just buying Dogecoin at .05 and selling it .06. That is why you see people pushing to accept Dogecoin as payment. If legitimatize Dogecoin as a cryptocurrency and currency when companies allow you to exchange it for goods and services. 

8. Question: Circulation of currencies. The importance of buying, selling, and holding - and the differences between them. 
		
Answer: To briefly explain this, a lot of people have been saying “buy and hold” or “I’m never selling!” - which in itself is great start. But there remains a lot of misinformation around the topic, for example that simply ""buying and holding Doge"" will drive up the price indefinitely. Unfortunately, that is just not true. Buying, holding, and selling are all intricately connected with each other. ALL of those three states are essential for a (digital) currency to flourish. Holding does neither hurt or raise the value of the asset, but rather it helps to establish a baseline, which is also called ""setting a floor"". Those who have diligently kept on holding their coins, have allowed Dogecoin to stabilize at its current price point. Remember, this remains a huge gain from where Dogecoin has been just months ago. An active circulation of a currency is critical to establishing it as an effective means of exchanging goods and setting it up for long term growth.

9. Question: Why is Dogecoin always hovering between a certain value (example between .05 and .06) explaining floors and ceilings. How large owners/whales impact market conditions. 

Answer: The day to day trends of Dogecoin may appear strange at first sight, but those who continue holding onto their Doge are affecting or rather creating the floor. The floor is essentially the lowest value Dogecoin will drop to at current market conditions. A common floor that’s been set for about a month is .05. Why is this value the floor at current market conditions? Because when the majority (around 1 million new people came into Dogecoin in February) bought Dogecoin at .05. This means that there is a large amount of people own Dogecoin and purchased it at this amount. To protect their investment and keep from losing money they are holding their Dogecoin and refuse to sell it at a lower price. This keeps the price relatively stable - called a floor. However a person with a large supply of Dogecoin (what they call a whale) can impact this because they own so much, they can effectively sell off so much that the price goes below the floor. The price will tend to rise back up to floor because people are buying in at the lower price to dollar cost average (lower the average per they paid per Dogecoin) which is known as “buying the dip”. Now to address ceilings. A ceiling is a price - that once Dogecoin hits that value - a majority of people begin to sell. The most common ceiling is .06. Now, why is the the ceiling and not something like .1? Well because there’s a subsection of this community who day trade - which is basically trying to play the day to day prices by buying in low and selling high and taking the profits. The most common values to use are whole cents. I.E. .05, .06, .07. If someone bought at .05 and sold at .06 they made a 12.5% profit on their investment. As Dogecoin steadily gains momentum through increased demand and utility Dogecoin will start to bypass the ceilings and replacing the ceiling with a new floor. 

10 Question: Mining Dogecoin. How new Dogecoin are created and enter the market/supply. It there an infinite supply of Dogecoin being produced? Comparison to Bitcoin and the US dollar. 

Answer:
mining is the process of creating new cryptocurrency by solving a computational puzzle. mining is necessary to maintain the ledger of transactions upon which cryptocurrency is based. Miners have become very sophisticated over the last several years using complex machinery to speed up mining operations. Approximately 600,000 dogecoins are produced per hour and 5,256,000,000 (5.26 billion) per year and there are currently approximately 128,000,000,000 (128 billion) Dogecoin. Now let’s compare this information to what we know about Bitcoin. Bitcoin currently has a supply of 18.5 million. Currently 900 Bitcoin are mined per day or 328,500 per year. However, unlike Dogecoin, Bitcoins mining rate is not fixed. Bitcoin has something known as a Bitcoin halving which means at some point in the future instead of 900 per day being mined 450 are mined. Now let’s compare Dogecoin and Bitcoin to the US Dollar. The US Dollar has an estimated paper money supply (more on this covered in a later section) of approximately (1.2 to 2 trillion) and in 2019 the federal reserve printed 188.3 billion paper dollars. This means that there is 10 times more supply of dollars to Dogecoin and the government prints 37 times more dollars than Dogecoin is mined per year. It is also important to note that this increase in supply of Dogecoin is fixed. It never changes. The federal reserve can change how much they print any given year. Many people think that this means that the supply of Dogecoin is infinite or infinitely increasing. That is not true in the span of our life time. It will take approximately 24 years for the supply of Dogecoin to double and it will take 360 years for the supply of Dogecoin to reach the current supply of the US Dollar. That’s without taking into account the fact that federal reserve adds more dollars each year than Dogecoin adds to its supply each year. Technically speaking the supply of Dogecoin will eventually reach infinity if given enough time but you have to remember that infinity isn’t an actual number. You can’t mine “infinite” dogecoin because infinity isn’t a number. It’s a mathematical concept to describe something that is boundless. Dogecoin doesn’t have a boundless increase. It has a fixed increase a set amount added at a specific interval. So in practical terms for the purpose of using Dogecoin as a legitimate currency, this infinite argument against Dogecoin doesn’t matter. In fact it’s actually way better than Bitcoin at exchanging goods and services because of this fact. That is why the price per Bitcoin is 40,000 dollars and the price per Dogecoin is .07 with a realistic possibility of only reaching $288.60 at current market conditions. That is why it costs .00012 Bitcoin for milk but only 50 Dogecoin for that same commonly traded commodity. That’s why Bitcoin will be treated like digital gold. That is why Dogecoin will be considered the next dollar. The price per coin are inherently different because their supplies are different.

11. Question: Should Dogecoin have a cap on its supply. What does having a cap mean, why do some cryptocurrency have a cap and other don’t? How does it affect the price? Will adding a cap increase the price per Dogecoin. Comparing bitcoin (capped) Dogecoin (no hard cap) 


Answer: - 
When people say they want a supply cap - what they are saying is that they want to place a limit on the total possible supply of Dogecoin. They point to bitcoin as having a cap, and since bitcoin has a cap, that must be why it is valued so high. Through scarcity. That is partially true, but it’s not because of the cap. The scarcity doesn’t come from having a cap, it comes from having a low supply and mining amount which reduces over time. Known as a bitcoin halving. 

Bitcoin and Dogecoin are two completely different cryptocurrency. Their supplies are different. Their utility is different. Having a cap does nothing in terms of the actual value of Dogecoin or bitcoin at the current moment. The cap only matters once that limit has been reached. The cap for bitcoin doesn’t happen until 2140. The price of bitcoin is due to the limited supply (18 million) relative to the global population, the bitcoin mining rate and bitcoin halving. All things that Dogecoin does differently. That doesn’t mean Dogecoin doesn’t have value. It doesn’t mean Dogecoin is infinite. It just means that they’re different. Dogecoin has a current supply of 128 billion, which is why the price is lower and harder to change in value. It is easier for bitcoin to rise $1 in price because the supply of bitcoin is so low and the supply of Dogecoin is so high. It doesn’t mean that Dogecoin can’t rise in price - just that it’s harder. 

Adding a cap won’t automatically increase the price because the cap isn’t the problem. You can’t reduce the 128 billion supply (unless you burn them or lose them). They already exist. People get confused because they don’t understand inflation and continual growth and why they are necessary for Dogecoin to a successful cryptocurrency based on the core parameters made when Dogecoin was created. They also don’t understand infinity. Dogecoin is not infinite. It can never reach infinity because infinity isn’t a number. As long as Dogecoin exists and is being mined it is not infinite. 

To further this point the original developers of Dogecoin have already stated that they will NOT be adding a cap. Adding a cap fundamentally changes Dogecoin at its core level and they’re just not going to do it. Here is the direct answer from the Dogecoin developers: “A, block reward is needed to secure Dogecoin network in a decentralized manner. Dogecoin is merge-mined with Litecoin, and that makes it somewhat secure against PoW attacks. But if Dogecoin reward will be too low, some Litecoin miners may drop Dogecoin, and our security will suffer. From this point of view, bigger reward is better. If you propose reducing the reward over time, you must also propose a solid way to keep Dogecoin secure. Now about the economic aspect. Current Dogecoin issue rate, taken relative to current total amount, is low, it's almost nothing compared to all the other factors that affect Dogecoin value. If you look at Dogecoin price chart since the introduction of current issue schedule, you will not see effects of ""inflation"" for all the wild price changes caused by other factors. And this already low issue rate gets even smaller over time, compared to total amount of dogecoins. The only real reason for these ""cap"" proposals is trying to ""sell"" Dogecoin to investors under the premise of possibly increased scarcity in the future. In my opinion, we don't need to try to appeal to investors. Dogecoin value will be increasing because of strong community and increased usage. And the fact that Dogecoin value increases is already enough for investors to jump in and increase it even more.”
You can read the full response to this directly from the developers here: https://github.com/dogecoin/dogecoin/issues/1674

Even if they DID add a cap it would actually be LESS beneficial for Dogecoin as a currency. 

Here’s some Basic economics explaining why. Inflation and deflation are common economic terms used to explain the change in the inherent value of a currency. This means that that 1 US Dollar today does not have the same value or “worth” as it did, for example, in 1950. Inflation is a situation of rising prices in the economy. A more exact definition of inflation is a sustained increase in the general price level in an economy. Deflation on the other hand occurs when the inflation rate falls below 0%, that is a negative inflation rate. While inflation reduces the value of a currency over time, a sudden deflation of a currency increases its relative value. This would allow more goods and services to be bought than before with the same amount of currency. Deflation can be a factor in leading to a recession and also result in a deflationary spiral.

Common follow up question:
What does all this mean with regards to cryptocurrency, specifically Bitcoin versus Dogecoin?

Well - Bitcoin is stagnant or deflationary over time, while Dogecoin is inflationary overtime. This is due to the way they are architected and mined, and how new coins are added into their respective markets What gets misunderstood is which one is “better” or rather ""the lesser evil"". Dogecoin doesn't need a supply limit like Bitcoin, because in the long run it will be much easier to exchange Dogecoin for goods and services, than with other crypto currencies or regular currencies for that matter. Bitcoin will continue to skyrocket in price because less and less are being mined. Bitcoin is like gold. Dogecoin is like the dollar. Bitcoin and Dogecoin have their pros and cons. Our current money is backed by signatures on debt contracts, not on real values. But it works, because we believe in it, even if it will be our downfall if it continues like this. Dogecoin is different. Dogecoin has a set amount of coins entering the market by the minute. There are plenty of spreadsheets out there showcasing exactly how much many Dogecoin will be in circulation at any given moment of time. People get confused because they think inflation is a bad thing, when in fact it is actually beneficial in small quantities and beneficial to the longevity of a currency.
Currencies have inflation - commodities don’t. Dogecoin is better suited to be a currency than Bitcoin is. Bitcoin is better suited to be a digital version of gold.

12. Question: Is a Dogecoin increase to the equivalent of one US dollar possible? Could and will it potentially happen? What would change if it does happen? How high could Dogecoin realistically rise in price? | Market cap explanation, and comparison to US currency and global FIAT currency. 

Answer: Despite not having a fixed or capped supply, yes, the value of dogecoin can rise based on its relative value against other currencies in the market in the future. You can find examples of this in the FOREX market where currency pairs are traded, like Euro against US dollar, or US Dollar against Japanese Yen. As the value of Dogecoin rises, more and more businesses will recognise its potential and importance, and subsequently begin to accept it in exchange for goods and services. This will also help to grow the developer community around Dogecoin.

Mathematically speaking market cap = price multiplied by supply
MC (Market Cap) = P (Current Price) x S (Current Supply)

MC (Market Cap) = P (Price) x S (Supply)
Market cap just means how much the total supply is “valued/worth” at a certain price. The exact definition applies to stocks; not cryptocurrency how ever for our purposes the mathematics still apply.

I see people saying how Dogecoin has a current market cap of $6 billion market cap and what the market cap needs to be for Dogecoin to be $1 is $128 billion. Then they say if 100 million people put $1000 in doge then doge will = $1.

THAT’S NOT HOW MARKET CAP WORKS.

Simply adding money to the system does absolutely nothing to affect market cap. The only two variables that change the market cap are price. And supply nothing else can change the market cap.

Market caps REAL use is a comparison tool. It’s used to compare how succulent a market is compared to other markets. 

* NOTE MARKET CAP DOES NOT MEAN TOTAL AMOUNT OF MONEY IN THE SYSTEM - A 6 billion dollar market cap does not mean there’s 6 billion dollars in the system. It means that the entire supply is “worth” 6 billion at the current price. When I originally wrote this people got confused so I wanted to clarify that.*  

The current market cap of Dogecoin while writing this article is $6,077,915,837 ($6 billion). If Dogecoin were to reach $1 today it would have a market cap of about 128 billion dollars ($1 x 128,495,957,919 circulating supply). Bitcoin (the most successful cryptocurrency) currently has a market cap of approximately $898,761,019,333 (~ $900 billion). This means that at $1, the total supply of Dogecoin would be “worth” about 1/7th of Bitcoins total supply. The estimated supply of the US dollar is about $2,000,000,000 (2 trillion), thus the market cap of the US currency is $2 trillion. If Dogecoin were to reach the equivalent market cap ($2tn / $128bn), the price per Dogecoin would have to be $15.60, thus matching the entire short-term US currency (M0 money supply in economics).

This is definitely not impossible, but it is highly highly improbable to reach such value any time soon. If that were to ever happen, it would take years. Now, the entire supply of the entire worlds fiat (short-term liquidity / paper) currency is $37 trillion. You can apply the same logic from above and see that the value of Dogecoin would have to be $288.60. If it was valued any higher than that amount, Dogecoin would be ""worth"" more than the entire world’s short-term liquidity currencies combined. It could technically go past this point, but what that would mean is that the economy behind Dogecoin would be stronger than the entire global economy of today. At that value you wouldn’t even compare it to the dollar anymore because it already surpassed all fiat currency. It’s not impossible- but is is highly unrealistic to pass that point. It is important to note that this number is not static. Which means if the market conditions change such as an increase in supply or change in price the numbers will change.

13  Question: Pump and dump vs long term growth and the difference between them.

Answer: ""Pump and dump"" is a form of securities fraud that involves artificially inflating the price of an owned stock through false and misleading positive statements, in order to sell the cheaply purchased stock at a higher price. Pump and dumps are illegal. While a subset of people are trying to pump and dump Dogecoin, the legitimate community is focused its long term growth and stability which is achieved through the rest of the topics addressed here

Essentially many people are just coming onto DOGE because it has low barrier to entry, and enticed by the idea of coming in low, selling what they have and running with the profits short term. This has lead to pumps and dips, and a lot of misinformation being thrown around. I should clarify some points for those who are coming in, instead of repeating the HODL and 
diamond hands rhetoric.
Planned pumps are not what Doge needs.
Pumps of this nature usually have an attached implication, which is that people will plan on selling, capitalising on the hype and then buying low to wait for the next pump. This leads to money being taken out of the coin, resulting in the lower price we now see. This means that planned pumps are essentially feeding sellers. We are not doing this in secret. This is a public forum and people with the intention have the information needed to drain us dry if we let them.
Essentially, if we want Doge to grow, planned pumps need to stop being openly advertised, or they need to die altogether. Of the two, the latter is the easiest, and it is what this post will be focusing on.

Sustainable Growth is now the way.
Pumps are fine when they're unpredicted - Elon Musk is living proof of that. However, planned pumps will result in our good boy coin shooting down to the dips, where sellers can reinvest and wait to harvest our money again at the next pump.
If however, we grow the price slowly, the floor will increase in a much more stable fashion, resulting in smaller dips. This will mean that the insane dips where sellers truly farm their coin at become very inhospitable to them, as they'd need to put more and more money to receive less and less profit. Essentially, by slowly growing the coin with organic 'food' instead of steroids, we can slowly choke out those parasites who are ruining the growth of the coin by making every dip a horrible investment for their time and efforts.
Sure, buy at the dips. Sure, hold the coin. But don't plan any more pumps. The less room you give to the sellers, the doubters and the paper hands, the more coin you can collect and the more profit that awaits you in the future.

Conclusion
If we come together as a community, Doge will truly live up to the hype - the people's currency. If we choose to continue listening to planned pumps, we have a very difficult, long and risky road ahead of us. Sustainable growth will beat large planned spikes any day.

14. Question: Elon Musk - Is he important for Dogecoin? The impact of celebrities and big business supporting Dogecoin Celebrity/Influencer Involvement

Answer: Elon Musk, Mark Cuban
As many may know, Elon is highly involved when it comes to “meme culture.” we can see Elon has tweeted several times concerning “doge,” reposting memes found from Reddit, as well as concerning himself with the ripples of the recent stock news. Mark Cuban, another notable wealthy, down-to-earth, community-involved individual, has recently mentioned “#dogecoin” specifically and actually began allowing his NBA basketball team to accept Dogecoin for payment. Regardless of whether these people have positive intentions towards $DOGE or not, their mention carries weight and public opinion and is a good assumption that new eyes are looking at us as a result. It should be noted that they have tweeted neutrally to positively towards $DOGE, not indicating a full-send support but they clearly are not talking down the possibilities.

Big business allowing Dogecoin to be supported as means of exchanging goods, and people like Elon musk supporting and backing this cryptocurrency are important to proving its value and legitimacy. 

However, it is important to remember that this is not the sole determining factor in the price. The price is determined through supply and demand and utility. Elon musk and other major high profile individuals doesn’t control that, but they do help 

15. Question: What is a 51% attack? Can it realistically happen? What are the implications if it were to happen?

Answer: A 51% attack refers to an attack on a blockchain most commonly bitcoin. Such an attack is possible but still just hypothetical. It requires group of miners to control more than 50% of the network's mining hash rate or computing power.

The attackers would be able to prevent new transactions from gaining confirmations, allowing them to halt payments between some or all users. They would also be able to reverse transactions that were completed while they were in control of the network, meaning they could double-spend coin. 

They would almost certainly not be able to create new coins or alter old blocks. A 51% attack would probably not destroy bitcoin or another blockchain-based currency outright, even if it proved highly damaging.

You may have seen an article going around talking about the 51% attack and why it will cause Dogecoin to go to zero. Regarding the 51% Hashrate attacks, Yes, they are real, and have been ever since cryptocurrencies aka Bitcoin started. The article even mentions an example. Now, if a large group of people with a lot of resources very effectively coordinated, they could indeed make a 51% attack on Dogecoin happen. But not just on Dogecoin, but also on many other, small cryptocurrencies. This is nothing new, this has basically been known for the last 10+ years. But the author of the article needs clicks, so there goes the horror-scenario headline... Possible - yes, absolutely. Likely, not very. Unless you have a large sum of people with a few resources each coordinating perfectly - that is in my honest opinion very unlikely - you could have governments, very large hedge funds, or maybe Elon Musk build a vast array of mining farms and do said 51% Hashrate attack. But again, that effort would only be worthwhile if those groups had a definite interest in destroying Dogecoin. There are probably other cryptocurrencies that would be more interesting from that perspective, such as litecoin. Of course, despite the sensationalist headline, for them clicks, the author covers their own backside by stating the following:
""In conclusion...Pretty much all the crypto besides Bitcoin and Ethereum are at material risk of a 51% attack, and it's not just a theoretical risk."" This problem is not tied specifically to Dogecoin, but to every single cryptocurrency. Now let’s do some math to calculate exactly how much it would cost in order to succeed in pulling off a 51% attack on Dogecoin. Dogecoin has a hash rate of 299.17 TH/s or 299,170,000 MH/s. If you were to use an RTX3090 which costs $2,000 US Dollars, and has a hash rate of 121 MH/s. You would need 1,260,964 RTX3090 at a cost of $2,521,928,926 dollars ($2.5 billion). Is it possible? Yes. Is it likely? No. 

16. Question: There is a lack of developer support for Dogecoin. The technology is outdated. Why would anyone come work as a Dogecoin developer when there are thousands of other cryptocurrencies? 

Answer: the original Dogecoin developers have already began working on the project with the new found support of the community and companies accepting Dogecoin as payment. The short answer is there is already development being done due to recent weeks bringing Dogecoin back into relevancy. Two Dogecoin developers are very active in the community. You can see their posts and reach out directly. However, remember they are extremely busy working on their personal lives and adding upgrades to the underlying technology behind Dogecoin. Their usernames are u/patricklodder and u/rnicoll. 

17. Question: if all of the above information is true why are so many people such as r/cryptocurrency and others are trying to discredit Dogecoin as legitimate cryptocurrency.  

Answer: The r/cryptocurrency and the majority of people are horribly misinformed. They find out about Dogecoin and take their biases and apply them Dogecoin before researching. R/cryptocurrency is a specific subset of society who has an extremely knowledgeable background in computer science and computer coding.  They may have a solid understanding of the technology aspect of cryptocurrency but the reason why Dogecoin will be successful is based on economics, mathematics, social theory and statistics as WELL as the underlying technology. Each of these topics is extremely intricate and each field requires years to fully master. No one person has all of the knowledge of all aspects of a cryptocurrency so when someone is attacking Dogecoin on why it won’t be successful is probably misinformed. Dogecoin is already successful. It’s been proven already. The question is HOW successful. Which nobody really knows the answer to. A large majority of r/cryptocurrency are gatekeepers who horde their knowledge while the Dogecoin community is focused on explaining and educating new people. R/cryptocurrency is notorious for being extremely serious and a lot of them feel threatened that something that started at as a joke/meme has the potential to be better at cryptocurrencies intended purpose - exchanging goods and services - than Bitcoin or any other popular cryptocurrency which is deflationary in nature. Others will try to discredit it because Dogecoin because it is novel and has gained popularity. There’s a lot of people who will discredit Dogecoin/cryptocurrency in general just because it’s new(ish) technology or because they don’t understand how it can be used. 

18.  Question: Will cryptocurrency replace fiat currency. Will cryptocurrency be the next world currency. Will the next world currency be Dogecoin?

Answer: 
People don’t realize the worldwide paradigm that is taking place right in front of our eyes. People are starting to see that traditional fiat (paper) currency back by centralized governments and debt are flawed and can be improved upon. Cryptocurrency is the future whether the people who can’t see it or try to disagree believe it or not. It’s inevitable. I knew it was inevitable in 2013 when I first heard about Bitcoin. A cryptocurrency will replace fiat currency in the future. Will it be Bitcoin? ETH? Dogecoin? Some other cryptocurrency that doesn’t exist yet? I don’t know. What I do know is that the only cryptocurrency that has inflationary tendencies that line up with traditional fiat currency very, very well, allowing for an ease in the transition, a community dedicated to its success regardless of the cost, a mascot that allows for ease for spread of information to the masses thereby assisting with mass adoption is Dogecoin.


Thank you for reading this post in its entirety. It took a large amount of collective effort of people in my discord. I appreciate them to no end. We are interested in explaining Dogecoin, reducing the scare factor and backing up Dogecoin through economic, social, financial, mathematical theory, etc. Per R/Dogecoin rules I cannot give out this discord, but if you are interested message me. It goes into greater detail on every one of these topics,  with resources, links, articles etc. thank you and above all else remember that at the end of the day this is a meme cryptocurrency from 2013. But the people have spoken, and this is now official the people’s currency as well. Dogecoin🚀🪐🚀",35.0,2021-03-10 17:58:51,0.97
"the miner ""show of force"" planned for April 1 will backfire","imo, miners are making a SEVERE miscalculation with this ""show of force"" planned for April 1, where some miners are planning to pool their hash power into EtherMine to ""demonstrate"" that the network \*could\* be 51% attacked, without actually attacking it

here's how i see it:

* many big miners aren't really users of Ethereum at all, and only holders for short periods of time (until they sell). they have evolved into a sort of sub-culture, mostly detached from the ecosystem
* many view ""the network"" as basically a contract b/wn core devs and miners, and they don't really understand the user/investor community, and how upgrades REQUIRE true community consensus in order to be successful
* but many miners know their days are numbered as Ethereum one day transitions to PoS. that's why they don't really talk about PoS. some of course will pretend it'll never happen, but others know better. they're planning for something else...
* ...i've talked about this for the past couple of years now, but i absolutely expect miners to attempt to maintain a PoW fork while all apps and users transition to PoS
* there is simply too much money to be made for miners and from some grifters in maintaining a PoW fork
* miners have allowed for issuance reductions in the past, and even eventually moved on from ProgPoW, b/c they always knew they could implement them later in their legacy PoW fork one day
* BUT EIP-1559 isn't like that. EIP-1559 is highly user-friendly and holder-friendly, and miner-hostile, in the sense that it could severely curtail miner profitability
* when PoS launches and miners attempt their legacy PoW fork, they COULD fork out EIP-1559 along with the ice age, but it'd look bad- really bad. that's why they think their best move is to fight it now, before it even gets in
* imo, this exposes some of these miners for what they are: extractive mindset. Ethereum is just a network that pays them. they ""love it"" because it's paid them a lot, but they have zero attachment to its community, users, or apps (b/c according to the f2pool lead, many miners don't even use the network). this is a rift which likely cannot be crossed at this point

**here's the thing**: fighting EIP-1559 IS STUPID, both in the near term and the long-term for miners

* miners are shooting their last bullet at the wrong time. they should have waited for the moment of PoS merge before trying to spur action around a fork. instead, they are saying ""HEY LOOK, WE CAN CARTEL TODAY IF WE WANT TO AND HARM THE NETWORK!"" 🤦‍♂️
* the truth is of course more nuanced and imo, the long-term incentives wouldn't be there to have a non-EIP-1559 fork at this time, but that's besides the point. the damage they are doing to themselves is palpable
* NOW, users and apps who MIGHT have been sympathetic to the miners' cause at the time of the PoS merge are just going to look back on this ""show of force"" event and cite it as a demonstration of how miners are not neutral, and that if push comes to shove, they may even be willing to attack the network
* what do you think that does to a post-PoS fork which stays on PoW? it's going to DRAMATICALLY reduce its legitimacy. perhaps to the point where it garners almost no support at all

some really sad game theory playing out from miners, who apparently aren't even coordinated enough to think this through. but i guess ultimately, that's a good thing for Ethereum",274.0,2021-03-09 14:13:28,0.94
Making the ecosystem more light-client friendly,"One of the challenges of the current Ethereum ecosystem is that while the protocol is theoretically light client friendly, and [light clients even exist and can be used today](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/tutorials/run-light-node-geth/), they're not nearly as commonplace as was originally envisioned. Particularly, all of the following environments _could have been_ secured by light clients, but are instead typically secured by APIs connected to centralized services:

1. Mobile phone clients/wallets, even those where the key management is trustless (Status, Argent, Loopring, etc etc)
2. In-browser wallets (Metamask et al)
3. Other blockchains

There are two main problems:

1. The Ethereum light client verification protocol _is not light enough_.
2. There's not enough incentive to _serve_ light clients, leading to weakened performance.

We can think of each of these two problems as being tied to a corresponding one of the two key parts of a light client protocol. The first part is to download and authenticate the **header chain**, giving you Merkle roots to transactions and history and state; this is the part that is stymied by the Ethereum light verification protocol's heaviness. The second part is, given the Merkle roots, to get Merkle branches for any data you want to learn so that you can authenticate the data.

### Light client verification of headers

(1) is a big deal. For a light client to stay synced with the eth-PoW network today, they need to sync the eth-PoW _header chain_, which is about 600 bytes per 13 seconds: trivial for a phone or browser app, but already getting expensive for the light-client-inside-a-blockchain use case. And in all three cases, it precludes the user-experience gain of instant syncing after a long time offline. Even worse, the PoW algorithm (ethash) takes a long time to verify. Despite being explicitly designed for light client friendliness with its ""cache"" mechanism, cache-based verification still takes a significant amount of time.

The beacon chain has some upgrades in store, coming in the [first hard fork](https://notes.ethereum.org/@vbuterin/HF1_proposal), that allow light clients to stay synced with the beacon chain much more efficiently: a mere ~10 kB per day should suffice for basic connectivity. Verification will be significantly more computationally efficient than ethash.

Note that even before the merge, a light client of the beacon chain can double as a light client of the eth-PoW chain: the beacon chain contains a hash of an eth-PoW block about 10 hours old, and so a client could choose to use the beacon chain to sync up to that point and then download eth-PoW headers from there. This would not be nearly as efficient as pure beacon chain verification after the merge, but it would still be a considerable gain.

### Merkle branches

The problem with Merkle branches is simple. There are _a lot_ of potential light clients, and each light client wants to learn _a lot_ of information about the history and state, and it's expensive to send all that information and generate Merkle proofs for it. The problem is worse because there's no incentive to help send information, so relatively few nodes are doing it.

There are two main kinds of solutions to this problem:

1. Create a channel-payment protocol where nodes can get paid for supplying proofs.
2. Reorganize the p2p network to make providing proofs simpler and cheaper; see [Piper Merriam's work on this](https://github.com/ethereum/stateless-ethereum-specs).

But either path will take some time to get right, and there's a lot of work to be done (realistically there's a good chance we'll need to do both).

### A short term path

But we should not despair from the complexity of a fully functional light client network. **Even if all we can do is have a trustless header chain verifier, and we can't make a reliable and decentralized protocol to fetch Merkle branches, this by itself can greatly increase the security guarantees of mobile phone and in-browser clients**.

This is because instead of asking a server to provide responses to queries and trusting those responses, a wallet can now maintain the header chain locally, ask the server to provide responses along with Merkle proofs proving that the responses are correct, and verify the Merkle proofs. **This is an intermediate mode that would be nice to move the Ethereum ecosystem over to soon**. In the longer run, we can work harder on making a more fully decentralized light client ecosystem.",88.0,2021-03-08 23:57:15,1.0
Expectations for backwards-incompatible changes / removal of features that may come soon,"The time between now and the merge, and possibly a little bit after the merge, is going to be a time of significant change for the Ethereum protocol. **These changes are needed for many reasons**: proof of stake and scalability, others to enable stateless validation, and others to simplify the protocol and make it easier to maintain it in the long term, all **setting the stage for a more sustainable long-term Ethereum protocol**. However, **some of these changes are backwards-incompatible, in that they may break existing applications or render them uneconomical**.

In all cases, these incompatibilities affect only a small portion of use cases, and there are alternative ways to get the same functionality, but nevertheless it's important to talk about these proposals early, so that developers have as much of a heads up as possible, and so that we have as much time as possible to refine the proposals to minimize disruption.

**After the merge** and the other important changes that are already in the roadmap today are complete, **I continue to think that it would be valuable for the Ethereum protocol to ""ossify""**, changing much less going forward so as to maximize developers' feeling of stability and ability to rely on protocol features. However, such an ossification is best done *after* we take into account our learnings from the past 6 years and make this one last push to make some major improvements to Ethereum.

This is my attempt at a partial listing of some changes that may happen.

See also: [this doc](https://hackmd.io/@HWeNw8hNRimMm2m2GH56Cw/evm_feature_removing), though the actual changes proposed there only cover the EVM, and this post is broader.

## History storage changes

* After the Ethereum application state is moved over to the beacon chain as part of **the merge**, we may want to discard the ethereum PoW chain, and no longer support any transaction or history queries going back into the PoW chain. **This greatly simplifies clients, as they can simply forget all the pre-merge protocol rules** and thus have a smaller and leaner codebase going forward, but it does mean that dapps that rely on looking back into history need to find some other way to do so.
* Even outside of the context of the merge, **we likely want to move toward a model where ""the network"" is only expected to be responsible for the most recent 1 year of history (including txs/blocks/receipts)**. This prevents clients from incurring ever-growing storage burdens, but it does once again mean that dapps that require old history will need an alternative way to get it.

## Statelessness / state expiry

See [my other post on this topic](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/lw7ug3/weak_statelessness_andor_state_expiry_coming_soon/).

State expiry is definitely likely to be the one change in this list that requires the most significant changes for contracts; contracts that do not change probably will not *break* (as the most recent state expiry schemes ensure that if you can find a witness, you can continue using existing contracts as is for as long as you want), but developers *will* likely need to build new versions of contracts to remain gas-efficient.

## EVM changes

* [**EIP 2929**](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2929) **(going into the upcoming Berlin hard fork)**, changing how SLOAD and calls/account accesses are priced. The first time an account or storage slot is accessed is now about 3x more expensive, but subsequent accesses are around 5-10x cheaper. On average, this only increases gas costs paid by users by \~0.3%, but it significantly improves the chain's DoS resistance and bounds on witness size.
* **Gas repricing for code witness size**: when we add code Merklization, to finish the job of bounding witness size we will need to charge some cost per chunk of code accessed in a transaction (eg. 400 gas per 32 byte chunk accessed). In general, this would somewhat increase the gas cost of ""simpler"" transactions (eg. an ERC20 approval accessed about 16 chunks so about 6.4k gas would be added) but it would only negligibly affect more complex transactions that loop over the same code many times. Gas limits can be adjusted upwards so that on average scalability remains the same as it was before, but even still, some applications may need to be rewritten to remain economical.
* **Removal or neutering of SELFDESTRUCT**: see [this whole document](https://hackmd.io/@HWeNw8hNRimMm2m2GH56Cw/selfdestruct) for the rationale.
* [**Removal of refunds**](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-3298) (proposed for the London hard fork), or limiting how refunds work, with the main goals of reducing block gas usage variance and freeing up blockchain space and storage being used by gastoken contracts.
* [**Removal of the 2300 gas stipend**](https://hackmd.io/@HWeNw8hNRimMm2m2GH56Cw/evm_feature_removing#The-2300-gas-stipend): a simplification to the protocol, removing a hard-coded value and hence making future gas cost changes more feasible
* **Replacing some precompiles with EVM code implementations**: this could be done mainly to simplify the protocol and the client code complexity, but it would inevitably come with gas cost changes.

## Miscellaneous

* **Ethereum is switching from RLP + hexary Patricia trees to SSZ and possibly Verkle trees**. This means that contracts that verify Merkle proofs into history will stop working at some point and will need to be rewritten. To allow developers to make Merkle proofs going forward, one possible route is to make an explicit ""history/state proof verification precompile"", so that whenever the state structure changes the precompile can change too, but of course this has not yet been implemented.
* **Block hashes will no longer be a good source of randomness** after the merge.
* The `DIFFICULTY` opcode will be useless after the merge (duh)
* **In the long run, quantum computers will break ECDSA and BLS**, and so everything that uses ECDSA or BLS will have to switch, and even ethereum 2.0 itself will have to move from BLS to a post-quantum aggregable signature scheme. **Fortunately, there has been a lot of work done recently by Starkware and others on making such schemes more efficient**, so we are very confident that we will survive the transition; but contract developers should necessarily be aware that this will happen.

There are likely items that I have missed, but this covers at least some of the important things that are worth watching out for. I highly encourage application developers and others to participate in this process and do so early, so that the protocol changes that end up happening can be done in a way that is as minimally disruptive as possible.",114.0,2021-03-03 20:07:39,0.99
BitSport - A Peer to Peer Competitive eSports Platform - DeFi Through Gaming," *Building the future of gaming fueled finance and capturing market value for the gamer for the first time.* 

 

[BitSport -  Competitive eSports Platform](https://preview.redd.it/ddlt8qm33tk61.png?width=11520&format=png&auto=webp&s=c8d7098f4cab7a9ff182c14d301988da476caabf)

BitSport is one of the first ever Peer to Peer Blockchain driven competitive eSports platform opening up several monetization avenues for Gamers and eSports in a competitive, decentralized fashion.

According to an in-depth breakdown by [NewZoo, The World’s 2.7 Billion Gamers Will Spend $159.3 Billion on Games in 2020; The Market Will Surpass $200 Billion by 2023](https://newzoo.com/insights/articles/newzoo-games-market-numbers-revenues-and-audience-2020-2023/)

. Gamers are gaming more, spending more on games, and growing in population while the current behemoth centralized gaming corporations continue to grow in market value, the gamers who make up the life-blood of the gaming community are left only as consumers. The BitSport platform offers an alternative ecosystem where instead they could be content creators that are earning in a diverse blockchain driven economy, capturing their share of the market, empowering the gaming community as a whole.

Along with a diverse array of opportunities for anyone to monetize their gaming skills, BitSport also gives spectators and sponsors an opportunity to capture a piece of the action with gamers themselves becoming an asset of their own. Thus creating a next generation, all inclusive, e-sports ecosystem in the process backed by trusted blockchain technology not just bringing the industry up to speed with the times, but into the future allowing for smart contracts to intertwine with existing online economies and creating new ones outright.

**Community Gauntlet**

With BitSport - we bring you the Community Gauntlet, where gamers are able to demand the type of entertainment they want. Here BitSport will host tournaments, and high-stakes matches amongst influencers. These matches can be community driven through voting, or opened by sponsors to create their own custom tournaments to suit their specific use case. These curated gaming events will then be featured on our Community Gauntlet section on [BitSport.gg](https://bitsport.gg/)

​

Current monetization modules and avenues for The Community Gauntlet are:

* Polls, Quiz's & Challenges
* Voting Rewards
* Pooled Staking
* Sponsored Tournaments ‌

**P2P Challenges**

Peer to Peer Challenges allow gamers to capitalize off their skills off their chosen titles. These challenges are open to anyone and are fueled by BTP. Matches are created by users with BTP, and rewards are allocated in BTP. Gamers will be able to inspect their opponents stats profile, and accept along with reject challenges.

**P2P Matches**

Peer to Peer challenges allow the community to back their choice professionals and influencers in the industry to and stake on the behalf of their picks. Creating a match pool of BTP that is shared by watchers and players alike. This BTP is then locked in a trustless smart contract, to be allocated by the outcome of the match determined by the size of each contestants pool.

**Locked Liquidity Matches**

Locked Liquidity Matches allow for BitSport to incentivize and drive engagement through low entry stakes Locked Liquidity matches where a BFI entry is required at a predetermined ratio between contestants. The opponents or teams will proceed to compete in their chosen digital realm. The winners of the match will receive their BFI tokens plus interest for winning. The losing party will have their tokens locked into a smart contract and held for 14 day intervals with increased rewards in BTP for longer lock times. This feature is to limit the flow of tokens onto exchanges and promote price stability, another facet of BitSport to promote anti-fragility.

Locked liquidity matches can also utilize the erc-721 protocol to reward users with unique digital assets in exchange for staking their liquidity further expanding the digital eSports economy. This protocol would allow for truly unique blockchain assets such as clan icons, or in custom in-game cosmetic rewards.

**Seasons**

Quarterly seasonal tournaments will be held, this will be dispersed into 4 continental zones. What games, formats, and prizes will be determined by the BitPlay community. These tournaments aim to drive maximum engagement from the community by giving them a real voice in the industry for the first time. Blending physical and digital realms into a new standard of experience..

Tournaments powered by BitSport will utilize existing streaming services to live broadcast to the world, while ultimately streaming native on the BitSport platform. Creating a lucrative space for brands to gain recognition, and viewers to be able to once again capture a piece of the action through features such as:

* Live airdrops to unique viewers reversing traditional Pay Per View structures.
* Various prize pool staking options
* Unique in-game items such as seasonal exclusive cosmetics

**Season Qualifiers**

Season qualifiers will be played in the first 3 weeks of every new fiscal quarter. A pre-determined number of participants would register to participate in their picked eSport title. Open qualification matches would begin and gamers will begin to compete for their seat at the finals. The frontrunners will be flown as part of an all expense paid trip to compete in the big leagues at the Grand BitSport Season Finals. Creating a truly AIO, level playing field for eSports to span all demographics and further empower the gamer.‌

**Sponsors (BitSport.Finance)**

Decentralized Finance (DeFi) is moving mountains in the financial space, changing our perception of how we can use digital assets, creating a myriad of creative solutions to intercept the dependency on banks we all currently rely on in the modern economic world.

BitSport is aiming to become the first to market to merge DeFi, with a decentralized gaming economy.

BitSport DeFi Monetization Modules‌

**BFI Trading Pairs and DEX:** Through locked liquidity match models BitSport will be able to host a Decentralized Exchange (DEX) with BFI based trading pairs, offering yield farming opportunities through automated market makers (AMM). The locked BFI through locked liquidity matches can be used to fuel liquidity pools providing earnings for everyone to be able earn even by losing. Matches can be built off trading pairs showing risk with transparency to all involved parties.

Stakeholders of matches will be either rewarded instantly as winners or over time with APY yields exceeding what is offered by any traditional banking institutions in a trustless fashion where users area able to see exactly where their assets are going and make informed decisions that reflect their personal interests instead of a third party in a legacy trust based institution.

**Sponsor DApp:** The BitSport Sponsor DApp is a lucrative way for anyone to support a favorite eSport team, established pros or climbing gamer wanting to prove their worth on the BitSport platform and earn rewards in BFI and other associated coins.‌

Sponsoring a tournament on BitSport is an efficient and low-risk avenue to maximize your yield and earning potentials on BitSport. Tournaments will follow predetermined protocols to allow for ultimate transparency between all parties utilizing the latest DeFi advancements to reduce risk exposure as much as currently available.

For each tournament, a smart contract fund is created where anyone can stake stable coins such as DAI, USDT, USDC etc, and farm BTP token rewards. Rewards can be claimed anytime while staked positions can be withdrawn once every 14 days.

Sponsoring a player on BitSport introduces a new feature to the world of eSports, turning players into assets for the first time. BitSport spectators can stake on the success of their favorite players. This gives the gamer liquidity to access bigger prize pools and progress through the ranks. Supporting spectators will be rewarded at a transparent pre-determined rate alongside their eSport picks.

**BitSport Finance - BFI**

Incentives, Rewards, Interests (for DeFi users) would be settled in BFI - the primary Cryptocurrency which governs BitSport Finance (BFI) for Sponsors.

High Gas Prices ⛽ Info & Resources,"Hey there Ethereans! 👋 If you've tried to send a transaction in the last few months, you've probably noticed that gas prices have gone up quite a bit. For some (myself included!), sometimes it doesn't make sense to experiment onchain as much as I used to.

I'll shed some light on the context here in this post:

* Resource List
* Why Gas Prices are High
* Are other chains as good as they claim?
* Other Initiatives
* How you can help

## Resource List

Before sending a transaction, try out some of the tips listed here to see the best times or fee depending on your urgency.

* [What Is Gas?](https://support.mycrypto.com/general-knowledge/ethereum-blockchain/what-is-gas#:~:text=When%20you%20send%20tokens%2C%20interact,your%20transaction%20succeeds%20or%20fails.)) (MyCrypto)
* [ethgas.watch](https://ethgas.watch/): aggregated gas price feed that checks multiple data sources
* [Etherscan Gas Tracker](https://etherscan.io/gastracker): Gas Guzzlers, Gas Spenders, Historical Gas Oracle Prices
* [GasNow.org](https://www.gasnow.org/): ETH gas price forecast system
   * Gas price, pending transactions, historical gas price, average gas price, API
* [ETH Gas Station](https://ethgasstation.info/index.php): the original Ethereum gas estimator
   * Top 25 Leaderboard, Tx calculator, tx pool vision, gas burners, API
* [Gas Prices & Trading Volume](https://explore.duneanalytics.com/dashboard/gas-prices-trading-volume): Dune Analytics Dashboard

## Why Gas Prices are High

Simply put, Ethereum is getting more and more popular! Every day, we see new users starting projects in NFTs / digital art, DeFi, governance - all with passionate communities that want to use Ethereum mainnet. It's been amazing to watch the usecases grow over the past few years.

At the end of the day, this means competition between users. Gas prices are subject to their own markets of supply and demand. When there are a lot of users trying to send transactions, gas prices will increase to reflect that.

This is easy to see in times of high volatility. For example, with the recent drop in ETH price on Feb 23, gas spiked to over **1000 gwei** as people tried to move their DeFi positions and arbitrage bots cleaned up market imbalances.

Having a market for block inclusion (measured by gas prices) is important because blockspace is limited. This means that there's a cap to what can be included per block. [Here's a chart](https://etherscan.io/chart/gaslimit) of the block gas limit over time. If there wasn't a limit to the size of blocks, then any sort of data could be put onchain for near 0 cost - this would break the chain.

In the near term, high gas prices may fluctuate, but over the long term, mainnet Ethereum may see sustained high gas prices when compared to previous years. Emerging Layer 2 solutions, which package many thousands of transactions to settle back to mainnet, will be able to pay a much higher gas price.

If you are interested in diving deeper, check out this report from 0x researcher Remco Bloemen: [Scaling DeFi — Layer One](https://blog.0xproject.com/scaling-defi-layer-one-7eeb24aca4f0)

## What are L2s and which ones should you try?

L2 stands for ""Layer 2"" - this is a big umbrella term for chain constructions linked to a base chain (Layer 1) in some way. While there's a wide range of designs, they all offload some of the demand from mainnet Ethereum while maintaining some or most of the security guarantees.

We're so excited about L2s because they will bring a new flavor of scaling before the merge with Eth2 is ready. Scaling means lower transaction fees! Here's a list of L2s that are live now or soon that you can try out. Remember, even though these protocols are promising, they are still early versions that will need to be battle hardened over time.

* ZkRollups
   * [Loopring](https://loopring.org/#/) \- Exchange and Payment Protocol
   * StarkEx - Starkware based Exchange that hosts [Deversifi](https://www.deversifi.com/) (Exchange), Immutable (NFTs), and [dYdX](https://dydx.exchange/) (perpetual contracts)
   * [zKSync](https://zksync.io/) \- scaling and privacy engine for Ethereum
* Optimistic Rollups
   * [Arbitrum](https://portal.arbitrum.io/) (on testnet) - rollup built by [Offchain Labs](https://twitter.com/OffchainLabs)
   * [Fuel](https://fuel.sh/) \- ""Fuel empowers any person on Earth with fast, secure, and cost efficient ERC-20 transfers and swaps using the world’s most efficient Optimistic Rollup""
   * [Optimism](https://optimism.io/) (live in March) - Instant transactions and scalable smart contracts
* Sidechains (Technically not L2, but they are often used for similar purposes)
   * [Polygon](https://polygon.technology/) (fka [Matic](https://matic.network/)) - a protocol and a framework for building and connecting Ethereum-compatible blockchain networks
   * [xDAI](https://www.xdaichain.com/) \- a stable payments blockchain designed for fast and inexpensive stable transactions

## Are other chains as good as they claim?

You may also heard other chains claiming ""come to \_\_\_\_ chain, we've got  low / no fees!!""  While on the surface it may seem appealing, there's probably more being left unsaid. A few potential explanations:

* They cut corners on decentralization - most frequently by increasing the hardware or bandwidth requirements for nodes. Ethereum takes this very seriously, and will only scale responsibly.
* They are hiding the true costs - like requiring users to stake funds to send transactions
* They will eventually run into the same issues as Ethereum - more users will inevitably lead to more congestion.

## Other Initiatives

* Near Term (weeks / months):
   * [Turbogeth](https://github.com/ledgerwatch/turbo-geth/) \- this is an experimental Ethereum client that rearchitected Geth to create a more performant client. Everyone should try to run a Turbogeth node to help them get ready for a full release! The strategies for state management TG is using, once present in other client implementations, may allow for a safe increase to the block gas limit while also maintaining the ability for consumer hardware to run nodes.
* Medium term (\~4 months)
   * Eip-1559 - Potentially being included in the London network upgrade in July, 1559 comes with a whole host of benefits
      * more predictable tx inclusion (important for L2s like rollups)
      * elastic blocksize
      * reduce some MEV
      * balance issuance w/ burn: a potentially steady cap asset that is still secure
      * in protocol congestion oracle - (very important for L2s like rollups)
* Long term (\~12 months)
   * Eth2 - Proof of Stake, also called Serenity will also increase the total available blockspace through sharding. The Beacon Chain (the first piece of Eth2) is already live since December 2020, and the first hard fork is expected in mid-2021. The merge, projected for Q4 2021 / Q1 2022, will unite Eth1 and Eth2.

## What you can do to help

To start, point people to this post - this info is only useful if it gets in front of people!

Comment your gas suggestions / hacks - I'll make sure to update the list at the top with the best ones.

You can also try out the L2 solutions as they go live, give feedback about the onboarding experience, and ask exchanges to support withdrawing directly to L2s. This will improve the experience for the existing community and everyone else coming soon.

"FUD (fear, uncertainty, and doubt) for the top 20 coins and why you should be aware of it, with permission from u/LactatingJello","&#x200B;

I recently asked u/LactatingJello if I could merge my deleted #11-20 FUD post into 1 big super post for the top 20 coins. He agreed, so here it is.

He did the top 10, while I did the top 11-20.

&#x200B;

>FUD (Fear Uncertainty Doubt) comes with every crypto coin no matter how perfect, decentralized, scalable, etc...  
>  
>So here's the major FUD for each of the top 10 cryptos for those who are new to the space or want to know more about why some have their doubts about these projects. Some of this FUD may not be ""true"" depending on how you view it but it nonetheless forms a major opinion on why there is FUD surrounding the project. In my opinion, it's important to be aware of it so you can form your own opinion for your investments and help spur discussion.

[Link to the post.](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/lp9i8n/the_fud_for_every_top_10_coin_and_why_you_should/)

&#x200B;

1. **Bitcoin** \- Although the pioneer of blockchain technology, it is considered slow, expensive, and unscalable compared to many emerging coins over the past 10 years (LTC, BCH, XLM, NANO, etc..) It's also much easier for you (depending on the country you live in) to send money to a friend or spend your currency at a store with credit cards or apps like Venmo/PayPal. At this point, many question why use bitcoin when they can just use their own currency reflecting how many don't perceive or care about the importance of decentralization. Another major piece of FUD is which country controls most of the bitcoin as it seems China and USA have a dominant control over mining operations which makes many believe that there is nothing stopping one country from attacking the network. Bitcoin also has some other FUD like how it's not a physical asset like gold, whales manipulating the price, what happens if I lose my keys, etc... but many of those arguments can be applied to other crypto and blockchain technology so I won't focus on them here. Forgot to mention, but also energy costs related to mining.
2. **Ethereum** \- It's no surprise that the major FUD against Ethereum is scalability. There are many platforms on the rise trying to take the spotlight from Ethereum and become a highly scalable and decentralized platform that provides cheap and fast fees for using its applications. Many believe the rise of ADA, DOT, and BNB are mainly because of Ethereum's scaling issues. There is alot riding on ethereum 2 to solve its scaling issues but still seems to be at least a year out before it transitions. Ethereum also has some FUD surrounding its distribution of coins and concerns of whales holding much of the supply but it seems to not have much of the focus right now.
3. **Binance Coin** \- The main argument against BNB is that its primarily centralized and doesn't have value other than being used to reduce fees when trading on Binance. With one company controlling the tokenomics and its future, it goes against what many believe to be the core tenet of blockchain which is decentralization.
4. **Tether** \- Although its a stablecoin, Tether has possibly the biggest FUD even when compared to bitcoin because of its lack of auditing and what many believe to be ""fake"" money propping up the price of bitcoin. If tether is ever found out to be artificially pumping Bitcoin with fake reserves, it would make the value of Bitcoin artificial and cause a large crash.
5. **Polkadot** \- The rise of DOT so fast into the top 10 this year has made many question its value. DOT had a large token sale in the past couple of years before it's release on exchanges which helped drive its price but makes some fearful of how much early investors control the supply before retail could buy in. Seen as a competitor to Ethereum, DOT is attempting an ecosystem of applications but has yet to prove itself when compared to the number of developers and transactions on Ethereum. There are also concerns regarding DOT's allocation of funding to developers in that there is a large amount of funding being aggressively driven to developers to create apps. There is also some FUD regarding its creator and a fictional story involving a minor he made in the past but I'll let you google that.
6. **Cardano** \- Another competitor to Ethereum is ADA which some believe to be a ""ghostchain"". With a long roadmap ahead and many items to deliver, Cardano doesn't have near the amount of transactions or applications compared to Ethereum but promises to be the 3rd generation of crypto platforms ahead of Ethereum. There are also concerns over how much the network is decentralized but that doesn't seem to be the main focus of FUD right now. Much like DOT, ADA is a wait and see.
7. **XRP** \- Many consider XRP to be what blockchain shouldn't be about and that is working with banks and other payment providers to facilitate transactions. With its focus on becoming the choice of crypto for banks and an all in one payment solution, many see it as a zero sum game considering bitcoin's value is about P2P transactions and being decentralized and free of the third party involvement. Ripple has also come under fire recently after being sued by the SEC for misallocation of funding relating to not registering as a securities offering.
8. **Litecoin** \- Seen as a clone of bitcoin with some minor changes to make it faster and cheaper, LTC's value seems to only be derived from bitcoin's value although that makes many question why they should invest in LTC when BTC exists. LTC's value also competes with other coins that are considered faster, cheaper, and more scalable. There is active development but some think it's small compared to other projects and some consider that the creater of the project, Charlie Lee, abandoned the project after selling his coins in 2017.
9. **Chainlink** \- Seen as an important piece of the Ethereum ecosystem to connect applications and data because of oracles, the major FUD against the project seems to be control of its supply by whales. Many may also not understand why Chainlink needs a token and its inherent value, as oracles can be a confusing topic if you're not already a crypto developer.
10. **Bitcoin Cash** \- This project has caused a lot of controversy as it was hard forked from bitcoin in 2017. It has attempted to solve bitcoin's scaling problem and become faster and cheaper but many believe it was done as a cash grab by the BCH developers to have a similar name to bitcoin and ride the hype of bitcoin. It also caused some other hard forks to occur like Bitcoin SV and Bitcoin Gold to cause even more confusion.
11. **XLM -** Stellar was made by Ripple's co-founder in 2014, sharing similar technology.  Both prices have been correlated to each other since then, so when Ripple was hit by a SEC filing in 2020, XLM alongside with XRP dropped hard. It has seen slower development than Ripple. Stellar is more appraised than Ripple due to being decentralized but both cater to banks and other financial institutions, which FUD is explained in XRP.
12. **UNI -** UNI is the largest ERC20 token by market cap, one that exists within Ethereum's blockchain. People were awarded these as airdrops for using Uniswap, a DEX. But because it came from Uniswap, there's some FUD about the coin which shed from the exchange. Uniswap has suffered several exploits involving minor tokens, $300,000 to $1 million of imBTC was stolen in April 2020, and $370,000 worth of Opyn tokens were stolen in August 2020. It's also been criticized for not being as transparent for decentralization. Being ERC20, it suffers the same scalability issues that ETH has, like high fees.
13. **DOGE -** A meme coin created in Dec. 6, 2013 forked from LTC by a person called Shibetoshi who created it in 1 day. It was never meant to be a store of value. It has an infinitely increasing supply of 10,000 coins per block at a rate of roughly 1 block per minute. Elon Musk hard shilling it on Twitter with several subreddits made it seem like a big PnD scheme.
14. **WBTC -** The ERC20 token for bitcoin, close to 1:1. Being ERC20, it suffers the same scalability issues that ETH has, like high fees. There's also controversies about tokenized BTC being that you're not owning actual BTC, just the representation of it.
15. **XEM -** An established crypto in Asia, many are skeptical due to its high centralization. Its blockchain is considered obsolete as others like Ethereum or Cardano can do better. Lack of development funding had led to a reorganization of their team.
16. **OKB -** Like BNB, OKB is centralized and used to reduce fees in the OKEX exchange. OKEX has much controversy, like suspending all cryptocurrency withdraws in 2020.
17. **HT -** Like OKB and BNB. Huobi, a Chinese CEX, has been shrouded with FUD as controlled by the Chinese government, i.e. conforming to the ban of initial coin offerings (ICOs) and trading on domestic cryptocurrency exchanges in 2017.
18. **ATOM -** A token used as gas for a project named Cosmos, with goals similar to DOT and ETH, but there is some uncertainty to the success of the Cosmos project due to its lack of widespread support.
19. **AAVE -** Many were skeptical about its sudden rise in price this year. As an ERC20 token, it has scalability issues.
20. **Monero -** As a privacy coin, it's used extensively in dark net markets. This led to CEXs seeing it as controversial, and a Bittrex delisting in the start of 2021, causing a noticeable plummet in price.

"GAINS Telegram AMA w/ Kellogg Fairbank (feat. Clare & Chris), Feb 18th, 2021 @ 1200 EST","    Where: GAINS Telegram (https://t.me/GainsChat)

    Date: February 18th - 12:00pm EST - 1:00pm EST

    Attendees:

    * GAINS admins
    * Kellogg Fairbank (Nash, Bizdev Lead)
    * Clare Saunders (Nash, Marketing Communications)
    * Chris Fenwick (Nash, Editor/Copywriter)



#Part 1: Questions from GAINS

>**GAINS**: Let's start by hearing a bit about you. What did you do before crypto and did you have any other previous venture in crypto?

✅ **Kellogg**: I've worked as a senior exec for a number of FinTech companies, including Braintree/Venmo and PayPal. I've also been a co-founder of a couple tech startups. Like most of us, I’ve been an investor in crypto for a number of years. At Nash, I lead business development and marketing.

>**GAINS**: Let’s talk about the project. What is the project about in a few simple sentences?


✅ **Kellogg**: Nash bridges the gap between crypto and your local currency. Our crypto/cash exchange service combines the lowest fees with instant delivery to the safest software wallet. With Nash Link for business, merchants can easily accept crypto from their customers and receive cash. Our digital banking services will seamlessly integrate DeFi-powered high-interest savings and a crypto debit card.

>**GAINS**: Is there any other crypto competitor(s) that seeks to do what you are doing? And what sets you apart?

✅ **Kellogg**: There are other platforms, but they can’t compete with our fees. Also, most other platforms can’t compete with our wallet security, based on multi-party computation. You can read more about that [here](https://blog.nash.io/the-safest-crypto-wallet/). Longer term, we hope to have unique digital banking offerings when it comes to making DeFi accessible.

> **GAINS**: For how long have you been working on Nash? How many people are on the team?

✅ **Kellogg**: I joined last summer. We have 34 team members

> **GAINS**: Did you raise funds so far? And how did you handle them? Are you planning to do any future raises?

✅ **Kellogg**: Yes, Nash raised over 20 million USD in our public security token offering and over 10 million USD from leading venture capital firms. Once we've successfully hit our growth metrics for Europe we'll look to raise a Series A to push into new markets. The Series A will help fuel that future growth: licenses in the various jurisdictions, marketing and adding new team members

> **GAINS**: How would you say adoption for your product has been? And what plans do you have to bring in more people to use your product

✅ **Kellogg**: The exchange didn’t quite have the market fit we wanted. However, fiat ramp saw 20% month-on-month growth since launch in September 2020. Thankfully, we can use the exchange to power the fiat ramp, letting us offer our leading 0% fees.

> **GAINS**: What is the use case of the $NEX token and how does it capture the value of the ecosystem you're building?

✅ **Kellogg**: NEX is a revenue-sharing token. Users can lock their tokens in a staking contract, with the maximum two-year lock offering a 75% proportionate share of company revenue. NEX offers a very accurate valuation of the Nash ecosystem, since dividends stakers receive are in direct proportion to the revenue we generate. Valuing the token according to a dividend discount model is hence very easy – although that doesn’t account for speculation about future success. 

Because revenue-sharing falls under the traditional definition of securities, we registered NEX with the FMA of Liechtenstein as the first digital security token in Europe. We believe that other exchange tokens are in fact unregistered securities, which could have consequences for their investors should regulations be enforced. Look at what happened with Ripple (XRP). NEX investors are protected from such consequences, as well as market manipulation.It’s worth noting that NEX is the only fully compliant exchange token. Other exchanges that are compliant don’t have tokens, whereas those that do are not fully compliant. As such, NEX is the only way to invest right now in the possibility of much stronger compliance in the crypto space.

> **GAINS**: What stage is your project at?  And what should we look forward to in the coming months?

✅ **Kellogg**: Growth phase, with a focus on Europe. We’ll be releasing a ton of new features that will simplify access for retail investors

#Questions from Twitter 🐥:

> 🐥 Question 1: Considering the changing focus from L2 exchange to wallet trading and savings, how will Nash catch up to the projects that have already positioned themselves in this area? Will Nash offer some innovative DeFi services that are yet to be established?

✅ **Kellogg**: Firstly, Nash will be able to offer better basic crypto buying/selling services than competitors. Our exchange lets us offer 0% fees for the main assets, and L1-only assets will still lead the market with just 1% fees. We won’t try to hide fees either by artificially inflating spot market prices. In addition to being the best priced option, don’t forget that Nash also comes with an ultra-secure MPC wallet. We’ll be rolling out even more security policies for this in the near future. This will be the safest software wallet available, and perfect for new users. We’ll be creating MPC wallets for new blockchains that we integrate, so in some cases will be the only MPC option available.

Secondly – yes, Nash will be offering some innovative DeFi services! We’ll be trying to make token staking and high-yield interest as accessible as possible, beginning in Q2. However, things will get even more interesting in Q3, when we integrate full checking accounts with IBANs into the Nash platform. You’ll be able to use Nash like a normal bank, but we’ll be giving users access to a simple crypto-powered savings account, making it possible for inexperienced users to take advantage of DeFi.

> 🐥 Question 2: With the new strategy how important is the exchange for nash ? Do you expect new users / traders logging and using http://app.Nash.io or buying coins using mobile( does new fiat -> coin needs to be added in exchange)

✅ **Kellogg**: We’re no longer pushing the L2 exchange as our main retail product. However, it remains crucial for allowing our other products to work – it’s what lets us offer 0% fees for the main assets, and also powers our solution for merchants, Nash Link (where you can receive crypto and get paid out in cash without even managing a blockchain address). So the exchange isn’t going anywhere. We’ll double down on liquidity for the main pairs and be pursuing professional traders who are attracted by our combination of low fees and high security.

For retail users, yes, we envisage a mobile-first approach, with people purchasing and selling on spot markets through the mobile app, rather than placing limit orders with the exchange UI. It will still be there, but our focus will be on the simpler buy/sell interface.

> 🐥 Question 3: Do you think that banks will lose ground to fintech companies like Nash or can the traditional banking system and fintech work side by side? -Your thoughts on blockchain in the near future and the role of Nash.

✅ **Kellogg**: I think the traditional banking world has finally caught on to the fact that crypto is here to stay, and safe to say is the future of finance. Banks that embrace crypto synergies will succeed in the short to long term.

We're already seeing these kinds of synergies today. One of the more interesting is crypto card providers, powered by Visa and Mastercard. Crypto debit cards offer consumers the opportunity to earn significantly more in cash-back rewards than the traditional consumer card, including rewards paid in bitcoin and stablecoins. Companies like Nash, that can help bridge the gap between traditional and decentralised finance and seamlessly merge the two, are the future of this industry.

> 🐥 Question 4: How soon are we going to  NFTs integration across Nash? This is no doubt the hottest topic for Crypto lovers

✅ **Kellogg**: DeFi staking will be coming in Q2. We’ll be developing a simplified crypto savings product as well with the help of a partner. In Q3, when we add checking accounts, we’ll also be bringing out a simple interface between cash and DeFi-powered savings.

Nash has no plans for introducing NFTs at this time.

#Part 2 - Quiz by Nash (led by Kellogg)

#Part 3: AMA (Questions from the audience)

> 🙋‍♀️ how secure is the funds and user data on Nash what kind of security system do you implement?  Does Nash ask its users to complete KYC?

✅ **Chris**: Users need to complete KYC to use the fiat ramp and trade above $5,000 per day on the L2 exchange.

You can find a description of our wallet system + signature protocol here:
https://blog.nash.io/the-safest-crypto-wallet/

If you're more technically inclined, we also open-sourced the wallet protocols so you can see what Nash is doing and how we generate seed phrases:
https://github.com/nash-io/nash-protocol

> 🙋‍♀️ When I read about $NEX, I didn't understand it a little, because I didn't understand English. Are you planning to expand the $NEX project to other countries? Do you have a team in each country to help you make your $NEX project known to communities from other countries?

✅ **Kellogg**: Our focus is on europe for now and we’ll look to expand to other regions perhaps later this year / next year most likely.

> 🙋‍♂️ Ultimately we need $NEX to be listed, so do you have a realistic estimate for acquiring a Security Dealer’s licence, and subsequently an OTF licence? How long after launch before we can expect BTC pairs?”

✅ **Kellogg**: This license is as you know very expensive so its not our immediate focus at moment. Our immediate focus is to be the leading cash/crypto exchange in Europe. Once successful, we can revisit

> 🙋‍♀️ What kind of marketing can we expect on launch day? Will your banking partners and seed investors promote the platform as well? I do not think Twitter is the best vehicle for call to action!

✅ **Clare**: We agree that Twitter is not always the best place for a CTA or the only one. Many people confuse marketing and advertising. We have been marketing the product by bringing it to institutions and businesses and creating collaborations with folks like Gunbot. With every agreement we have we arrange co-marketing. Nash is only interested in data backed advertising. We do not believe in spending money if we are unsure if there is an ROI. As we said in Q1 there will be a stronger push to spread the word about Nash through various channels but we will not be putting our name on soccer jerseys 😜

> 🙋‍♀️ I saw from the Nash Exchange, only a few coins / tokens can be traded. Such as BTC, ETH, NOIA, NEO, LINK, GUNTHY, GAS and BAT. Do you have any plans in the future to add more coins/tokens for trading? And why is NEX as a native token from Nash not traded on the Nash exchange?

✅ **Chris**: Yes, we plan to add at least 10 more major coins this year. You can read about these plans in our 2021 strategy article:
https://blog.nash.io/bridging-the-gap-between-fiat-and-crypto/

The issue is that so far, Nash has offered a Layer-2 exchange. This makes it very hard to add new blockchains (state channels must be built). It also makes it harder to keep deep order books, because we cannot do paper trading and need all assets to be on the chain. Our L2 works amazingly for the top pairs, but providing liquidity on every pair is a challenge, and adding new chains (not just ERC-20 tokens) is a huge challenge. 

That's why we're shifting to adding wallets and allowing direct trading on at spot prices.

Re. NEX: it's a security, and we don't have the license required to trade it. You can find it on other secondary markets like Uniswap. We even integrated the Uniswap pool into our mobile app.

> 🙋‍♂️You stated earlier that Nash bridges the gap between crypto and local currency. 

> Some countries restricted local banks from executing cryptocurrency transactions. Can Nash be of help to users in this scenario? 

>""With Nash Link for business, merchants can easily accept crypto from their customers and receive cash.""

>Would this be in form of P2P? In case of transaction disputes between customers and merchants , would Nash step in?

✅ **Kellogg**: Nash is a fully compliant cash/crypto exchange and complies with the local jurisdictions we operate in. Unfortunately, there are some countries that we can’t offer our services in where local law does not allow for it. For Nash Link, any European based company can use our services to accept crypto payments from any person or company globally.

> 🙋‍♀️ The trading volume on Uniswap and Balancer is growing every day. Do you feel the competition from decentralized exchanges and what is your strategy to become the market leader?

✅ **Chris**: We won't really be competing for the same market with our new fiat gateway and digital banking services. Also: Uniswap is difficult for new users to get to grips with, especially given the crazy ETH fees at the moment. We're really hoping for a more intuitive experience, especially when it comes to moving between cash and crypto. That will truly be visible when we integrate checking accounts.

> 🙋‍♀️ Explain your plans on global expansion, 
> Q1) is it only market you are focusing All the time? 
> Q2) Or you focus on building or developing and getting customers and users, or partnerships?

✅ **Kellogg**: Focus on Europe for for 2021.

> 🙋‍♀️ The $NEX will fight to avoid censorship of users on the Internet, but how will you avoid your own censorship? Aren’t you afraid that it will undermine your project and autonomy?

✅ **Chris**: If this is a complaint about us having moderators on our Telegram and community channel: This really isn't analogous to governments censoring free speech, publication of political opinions, artworks, etc., and fining people or throwing them in jail. That kind of argument is just disingenuous. Those are our important marketing channels for us and filling them with FUD is a bit like defacing our website. They're not some sort of public commons.

> 🙋‍♂️One of the most popular problems for newbies is the deposit and withdrawal of fiat money. How is this feature implemented on Nash? Are you planning to issue a payment card using Visa or Mastercard?

✅ **Chris**: We're partnering with Railsbank, as announced in our strategy article:
https://blog.nash.io/bridging-the-gap-between-fiat-and-crypto/

> 🙋‍♀️ Currently, NEX tokens run on ERC20 and NEP5. Are there any future plans for NEX tokens to also run on other networks such as the Binance Smart Chain (BSC) or other networks that have lower transaction fees?

✅ **Chris**: There's no current plan to make an additional token bridge, but we will add an ETH-based staking contract in future.

> 🙋‍♀️ Elaborate more how the NEX security token allows  to deliver strong token economics for investors in Nash exchange?

✅ **Clare**: The strong tokenomics is simple - it follows a dividend discount model. The longer you stake (up to 2 years) the higher % rate of dividends  you will receive.

> 🙋‍♀️ Decentralized exchanges are in a better position to maintain sufficient liquidity in the market at all times, by working on Blockchains like Ethereum, decentralized exchanges face challenges with their transaction execution times as well as their commissions, which make trading these exchanges expensive and complicated. For merchants, $NEX as a decentralized exchange and under the Thorchain and Cosmos infrastructure, can it cover a solution to this problem in general and offer traders a better experience?

✅ **Chris**: Our L2 exchange is unique when it comes to the main pairs: BTC and ETH. For our retail offering, we're moving towards pushing the local currency pairs at spot price. We won't be looking into building another DEX with totally different tech.

> 🙋‍♀️ $NEX Token is a governance token that holders can use to pay for token creation / staking contracts / yield farm contracts. Apart from the above statement, can the holder use it for other purposes? If so, can you name other uses for $NEX?

✅ **Chris**: NEX isn't a governance token. It is a revenue-sharing token. You stake the token and you receive a share of Nash's revenue.

> 🙋‍♀️ What strategies will you employ to bring non-crypto-natives into the $NASH ecosystem? How does $NASH balance between developing technology and increasing the $NASHtoken value?

✅ **Chris**: We'll be beginning our main advertising campaigns this Q1. 

We believe the token value will increase as we release more products and gain more market traction. We are not going to artificially pump the token. It's a security.

> 🙋‍♂️ How about depositing and withdrawal straight from L2?

✅ **Chris**: Not on the roadmap for now afaik. We're shifting our main focus for retail users to the fiat gateway.

> 🙋‍♂️ Can I ask you to please elaborate on what Kellogg meant earlier about the Series A fundraising round in the future? Wouldn’t it negatively affect the NEX token and stakers to bring more priority to shareholders?

✅ **Kellogg**: No not at all, any fundraising would be done with existing shareholders as our priority. Remember, all Nash employees are also “shareholders” in Nash, and so we take this very seriously. Series A could be a combination of equity or tokens, or both, the details of which have not even been considered because its not a focus at this time. However, any fundraising will be for the sole purpose of expanding into new markets, mainly to acquire licenses (which are expensive when you expand globally) and pay for marketing.

> 🙋‍♂️ How the #NASH will address issues like: -How do you address missing market maker on exchanges to provide liquidity? -How to grab a bigger chunk of the market from CEXs? -Why should cryptotraders switch from their current platforms to NASH?”

✅ **Chris**: Liquidity on our main pairs has increase dramatically over the last couple of weeks thanks to a new market making partner.

We aim now to compete mainly for retail users wanting simple buy/sell tools. In that regard, yes, we hope to compete with big CEXes because we will offer much better fees (0%!) and security (MPC), as well as digital banking services coming later in the year.

The L2 we will market to pro traders via our bizdev team. We know they are interested — the fee structure is good for them, as well as the security.

> 🙋‍♀️ Most of the projects I have encountered, the token value of the project after pre-sale & listing on the exchange always ends up rugpulled, exploited or hacked, so that investors become traumatized in buying tokens & investing, so What about Nash?

✅ **Chris**: There was no pre-sale for Nash. All VCs bought it at $1, same as ICO investors. This was all in 2018.

> 🙋‍♂️ Tell us a little bit about  security? Have you done an audit of the platform? Are the smart contracts error-free? What are the test results?

✅ **Chris**: We've had a number of audits by major firms, including NCC Group and Recurity. There were no critical issues.

> 🙋‍♂️ Ultimately we need $NEX to be listed, so do you have a realistic estimate for acquiring a Security Dealer’s licence, and subsequently an OTF licence? How long after launch before we can expect BTC pairs?”

✅ **Chris**: The digital securities market is very small, so pursuing these licenses is not a business priority right now. If we want $NEX to appreciate, we need more users and revenue adding real value to the token.

> 🙋‍♀️ When I read about $NEX, I didn't understand it a little, because I didn't understand English. Are you planning to expand the $NEX project to other countries? Do you have a team in each country to help you make your $NEX project known to communities from other countries?

✅ **Chris**: We want to expand globally, but are focussing on Europe for now since that is where we have the licenses to operate. When we are profitable in Europe, we'll start expanding elsewhere.

> 🙋‍♂️ What can you tell about the defi partner mentioned in the strategy doc ?

✅ **Chris**: Nothing until we announce the partnership officially. These agreements come with planned co-marketing, etc. We're excited about it, that's for sure 😊

> 🙋‍♀️ Will nash create something similiar to metamask? Allowing third party application to gain a benefit from nash MPC wallet.

✅ **Chris**: We're not going to make a browser extension. The necessity of such extensions was kind of killed by WalletConnect, which we integrated (WITH MPC) into our mobile app already.",23.0,2021-02-18 19:28:21,1.0
"The Power of Positivity - Shibe School 101, Lesson #2 ~ explaining Cryptocurrency as simply as possible, by Dogecoin creator Billy Markus","&#x200B;

[much education](https://preview.redd.it/c5ftqswy63i61.png?width=300&format=png&auto=webp&s=08045c7c3e50aca85561163fa0be5796d48f2cc8)

Today is a simple lesson. I have a question and answer for you all. What is Dogecoin's value proposition? What is its differentiating factor? *What makes it special?*

***Was Dogecoin the first crypto and thus cornered the market?***

Nope, that would be Bitcoin, the OG. All respect to Dogecoin's great great granddad.

***Does Dogecoin have the best tech in crypto?***

Nope, arguably that hat currently belongs to Ethereum. Though I will say Dogecoin is no slouch in that department, a merge mined crypto that has been running for 8 years is quite remarkable in this space, and the current core devs have done a great job maintaining it.

***I give up then. What makes Dogecoin truly special?***

I'll tell you exactly what it is.

**It's you.**

There are thousands of clone coins. Many thousands of failed projects. Many meaniningless buzzwords. But Dogecoin has carried on. Dogecoin's success and longevity can be directly attributed to the people who cared, who made the effort, who contributed to it, who used it, enjoyed it, created memes, created art, created games, created services, and kept the community one that is welcoming, kind, and fun in a space often occupied by greed and tribalism.

Our value - our differentiating factor - is in the people of the community. Cryptocurrency is *decentralized* by nature - no one owns Dogecoin and everyone owns Dogecoin. Everyone who works on the core code, on its services, on the community - everyone is a volunteer, and always have been.

The longevity and utility of the coin comes from everyone involved. Hosting events, good causes, funny memes, useful or funny videos - everything that helps this community be worthwhile.

Let's keep this special. **A 1 million person+ community can do so many great things.** We've already achieved quite a bit in the last 8 years, with much smaller numbers. But now, we are much bigger. Let's see what we can *really* do, together.

Misconceptions Regarding Dogecoin FAQ,"I don’t know if this will provide help for anyone here in this sub Reddit. But it is what I have been using to educate people in R/Dogecoin. If you guys read over it and something is wrong please let me know and I will update it. I’m willing to learn myself.

Thank you guys

Here’s the full post

This information below is important. I ask that you please take the time to read this entire post before making judgment or commenting. My discord group of over 100 people have grouped together the majority of the most asked questioned and misunderstandings regarding Dogecoin, into the following 17 key points. Even if you know the answers to some of these please read the entire post. Please read them below. 

1. Question: What is Dogecoin?

Answer: Dogecoin (/ˈdoʊdʒkɔɪn/ DOHJ-koyn, code: DOGE, symbol: Ð) is a cryptocurrency invented by software engineers Billy Markus and Jackson Palmer, who decided to create a payment system that is instant, fun, and free from traditional banking fees. Dogecoin features the face of the Shiba Inu dog from the popular ""Doge"" meme as its logo and namesake. It was introduced on December 6, 2013, and quickly developed its own online community reaching a market capitalization of US $5,382,875,000 on January 28, 2021. [Wikipedia, 20210203]

2.  Question: Why Dogecoin?

Answer: For the Lolz. Well, not quite. Initially as a purely meme-driven alternative to the likes of Bitcoin and Litecoin, Dogecoin in-fact boasts very low transaction fees and fast transaction times, very little network congestion, and most importantly, is designed to be used as a daily means of exchange, like your morning cup of coffee. Also, it is really fun, and who doesn't like the Dog ?!
		
1/2 - second perspective) Question: What Is Dogecoin? And why Dogecoin?

Answer: Back a few years ago, some crazy people banded together in support of a cryptocurrency known as Dogecoin. Similar to other cryptocurrencies, Dogecoin, the people's crypto, finds itself with the support of hundreds if not thousands of individuals pushing for this currency to succeed. But why is that? Unless you have been absent from every social bubble, you may have heard of Bitcoin. For the purpose of this explanation, you will find that Bitcoin is not exactly an easy thing to equate to Dogecoin, but lets think about the criteria of a Cryptocurrency.Bitcoin did not find its foothold overnight. In fact, it took several years. A lot of people fought tooth and nail for their belief in the coin. Crypto, in a nutshell, is a decentralized form of currency that finds its value in a combination of individual asset involvement, ease or difficulty in security of an exchange, creating a method of reliable, secure, trustworthy exchange, and other reasons. 

Think of it like this: to exchange goods and services without currency, one must barter. I can barter a service (a haircut, for example) towards someone who needs a haircut, and in exchange they can barter a good or service to me.Currency then becomes an ""IOU"" (I Owe yoU) so that, if somebody needs me to cut their hair, they can give me an IOU for a good or service they control. When enough people begin adopting this, a centralized currency eventually takes hold. Crypto seeks to take this a step further and, insteal of relying on building up a centalization in terms of valuable metals or debt, it is built up solely on the exchange of goods and services. Dogecoin, compared to other cryptocurrencies, finds itself in a strange position where the origins did NOT see it soaring to the moon in any situation. Funny how things can change in time. Dogecoin has pros and cons to it. Comparing it to other cryptos, it does not face a supply cap like Bitcoin does. It is not a directly equated asset, such as how Bitcoin can be attributed as a digital gold asset. Mining dogecoin is also much simpler (comparitively) and does not face difficulty spikes, a source of Bitcoin slow-down. In essence, in 50 years, Dogecoin will still be around, still be mined, still be traded. Bitcoin will cease to be created, hoarded, and become the digital currency of the affluent.

3. Question: Places to buy dogecoin places where you can spend Dogecoin? 

Answer: Refer to r/dogecoin posts by the moderators for a list of businesses that accept doge as payment. 

4. Question: Cryptocurrencies vs stocks. The main differences between them. 
		
Answer:  
A stock is a type of investment that represents an ownership share in a company. Investors buy stocks that they think will go up in value over time. ... A stock is an investment. When you purchase a company's stock, you're purchasing a small piece of that company, called a share. 

A cryptocurrency:  (crypto for short) is a digital a sset designed to work as a medium of exchange wherein individual coin ownership records are stored in a ledger existing in a form of computerized database using strong cryptography to secure transaction records, to control the creation of additional coins, and to verify the transfer of coin ownership. It typically does not exist in physical form (like paper money) and is typically not issued by a central authority. Cryptocurrencies typically use decentralized control as opposed to centralized digital currency and central banking systems. When a cryptocurrency is minted or created prior to issuance or issued by a single issuer, it is generally considered centralized. When implemented with decentralized control, each cryptocurrency works through distributed ledger technology, typically a blockchain, that serves as a public financial transaction database.

When comparing crypto to stocks, the main thing to keep in mind is that cryptocurrencies have few if any regulations applied to them. It is still the ""wild west"" of trading. You can be scammed, skimmed, pumped-dumped, as so forth, much more often and more easily than with stocks. Terminology is similar to exact between the two, but both require a certain mindset. Crypto is almost always a long-haul game, where stocks can be short play or long haul. Cryptocurrency is literally money. Cryptocurrencies intended purpose is to use it to exchange goods and services. The way paper money is. 

5. Question: Is Dogecoin a product of the Wallstreet Bets movement? What differentiates dogecoin from GME/AMC?

Answer: no. The rest of this article explains why. 
6. Question: Difference between cold storage, internet wallets and Robinhood

Answer: 
Coldstorage - in the cryptocurrency world cold storage refers to physical objects/devices that contain your cryptocurrency. 

Wallets are an electronic program of service that stores your cryptocurrency. There a number of different wallets - but I personally use Dogecoin.info

Robhinhood- as of right now robinhood does not actually give you cryptocurrency when purchased through them. From Robhinhood’s cryptocurrency page: “We don’t currently provide you with access to your wallet or your wallet address.
You own the cryptocurrency assets in your account, and you can buy or sell them at any time. We’re evaluating features to allow you to safely transfer coins to and from Robinhood, and we’ll update you when these features are available.” Robhinhood will be addressed in another section. 


7. Question: Dogecoin vs Bitcoin - their competitive advantages and disadvantages. Answer: information explaining the advantages and disadvantages of Bitcoin vs Dogecoin will be explained throughout this article. 
8. Question: Is Dogecoin a meme or should it be taken seriously? 

Answer: We have all witnessed the power of a meme, the depths it can reach in society, especially in recent years. We have seen it many times before with video games, consoles, Oreos, or as of late even toilet paper... A meme has inherent value in the form of “widespread information”. A meme can spread an idea across diverse communities, and even entire countries literally overnight. This can bring about lasting effects on culture and society. If correctly taken advantage of, Doge can become the dominant meme currency of the internet, and amass real-world value just by being a popular, recognisable meme itself. This is where the saying “Dogecoin is the people’s coin” comes from. This is marketing 101. If your idea, or product is too complicated or not enough people know about then it doesn’t matter how technologically sound it is. Dogecoin have the best technology? No. Can it be improved upon. Definitely. In fact, the original developers have started working on the project again. An analogy I like to use is this. McDonald’s makes hamburgers. They have a clown as a mascot. A literal personification of a joke. Does make McDonald’s make the best hamburgers? No. Does McDonald’s have “value” in their industry? Undeniably so. So what does McDonald’s do correctly? They provide a cheap, easily accessible, and brand able product to the masses. Which is what dogecoin does for cryptocurrency. 

9. Question: Mining Dogecoin. How new Dogecoin are created and enter the market/supply. It there an infinite supply of Dogecoin being produced? Comparison to Bitcoin and the US dollar. 

Answer:
mining is the process of creating new cryptocurrency by solving a computational puzzle. mining is necessary to maintain the ledger of transactions upon which cryptocurrency is based. Miners have become very sophisticated over the last several years using complex machinery to speed up mining operations. Approximately 600,000 dogecoins are produced per hour and 5,256,000,000 (5.26 billion) per year and there are currently approximately 128,000,000,000 (128 billion) Dogecoin. Now let’s compare this information to what we know about Bitcoin. Bitcoin currently has a supply of 18.5 million. Currently 900 Bitcoin are mined per day or 328,500 per year. However, unlike Dogecoin, Bitcoins mining rate is not fixed. Bitcoin has something known as a Bitcoin halving which means at some point in the future instead of 900 per day being mined 450 are mined. Now let’s compare Dogecoin and Bitcoin to the US Dollar. The US Dollar has an estimated paper money supply (more on this covered in a later section) of approximately (1.2 to 2 trillion) and in 2019 the federal reserve printed 188.3 billion paper dollars. This means that there is 10 times more supply of dollars to Dogecoin and the government prints 37 times more dollars than Dogecoin is mined per year. It is also important to note that this increase in supply of Dogecoin is fixed. It never changes. The federal reserve can change how much they print any given year. Many people think that this means that the supply of Dogecoin is infinite or infinitely increasing. That is not true in the span of our life time. It will take approximately 24 years for the supply of Dogecoin to double and it will take 360 years for the supply of Dogecoin to reach the current supply of the US Dollar. That’s without taking into account the fact that federal reserve adds more dollars each year than Dogecoin adds to its supply each year. Technically speaking the supply of Dogecoin will eventually reach infinity if given enough time but you have to remember that infinity isn’t an actual number. You can’t mine “infinite” dogecoin because infinity isn’t a number. It’s a mathematical concept to describe something that is boundless. Dogecoin doesn’t have a boundless increase. It has a fixed increase a set amount added at a specific interval. So in practical terms for the purpose of using Dogecoin as a legitimate currency, this infinite argument against Dogecoin doesn’t matter. In fact it’s actually way better than Bitcoin at exchanging goods and services because of this fact. That is why the price per Bitcoin is 40,000 dollars and the price per Dogecoin is .07 with a realistic possibility of only reaching $288.60 at current market conditions. That is why it costs .00012 Bitcoin for milk but only 50 Dogecoin for that same commonly traded commodity. That’s why Bitcoin will be treated like digital gold. That is why Dogecoin will be considered the next dollar. The price per coin are inherently different because their supplies are different. More will be covered on this topic on another section of this article. 

10. Question: Does Dogecoin have value? How does Dogecoin increase in price or decrease in price? 

Answer: Yes. Dogecoin has value. It is currently valued at between .06 and .08 as of writing this. If didn’t have value then it wouldn’t be bought or sold at all. Anything can have value as long as enough people assign it value and agree to it. The value of any means of exchange is fundamentally driven by supply and demand. If two parties agree that X amount of asset A is roughly worth the same as Y amount of asset B, you effectively have established a market.  That’s why the US dollar and other fiat currency has value even though it just a piece of paper. The difference between fiat currency and cryptocurrency is that fiat currency is determined by centralized government and other underlying economical/market conditions. Cryptocurrency is meant to be a decentralized form of fiat currency. Now as to why the price changes from say .05 to .06 (random numbers using this as an example for explanation purposes. It is not exact) this value is driven primarily by supply and demand. We already know the supply of Dogecoin, so for the purpose of this the main driving factor in the change in price is demand. But the demand for Dogecoin isn’t just one person. It’s the entire group of people who own Dogecoin. So if at any given time lets say 10 people with 1000 Dogecoin want to sell. But only 5 people want to buy 1000 Dogecoin. This means that the sellers “value” Dogecoin less at its current price than buyers do. 5000 Dogecoin less. This changes to price from .05 to .49. The same applies if more people wanted to buy. Then the price would go from .05 to .051. An algorithm repeats the process over and over constantly updating the price. However that’s only one way to change the value. The best way to increase the overall value of the currency in the long run is by eventually by exchanging your coins for goods, services, or just by tipping and trading with other Dogecoin holders. This gives Dogecoin utility. Which basically means that it can be used for something other than just buying Dogecoin at .05 and selling it .06. That is why you see people pushing to accept Dogecoin as payment. If legitimatize Dogecoin as a cryptocurrency and currency when companies allow you to exchange it for goods and services. 


8. Question: Circulation of currencies. The importance of buying, selling, and holding - and the differences between them. 
		
Answer: To briefly explain this, a lot of people have been saying “buy and hold” or “I’m never selling!” - which in itself is great start. But there remains a lot of misinformation around the topic, for example that simply ""buying and holding Doge"" will drive up the price indefinitely. Unfortunately, that is just not true. Buying, holding, and selling are all intricately connected with each other. ALL of those three states are essential for a (digital) currency to flourish. Holding does neither hurt or raise the value of the asset, but rather it helps to establish a baseline, which is also called ""setting a floor"". Those who have diligently kept on holding their coins, have allowed Dogecoin to stabilize at roughly 0.07 USD cents for the past few days. Remember, this remains a huge gain from where Dogecoin has been just weeks ago. The reason the price is not changing much from this baseline right now is because few are buying and few are selling their Dogecoin, specifically due to topics which will be covered in other sections here. However, an active circulation of a currency is critical to establishing it as an effective means of exchanging goods and setting it up for long term growth. More on the value of Dogecoin in another section. 
	9. Question: Establishing a floor or a baseline.

Answer: The day to day trends of Dogecoin may appear strange at first sight, but those who continue holding onto their Doge are affecting or rather creating the floor. The floor is essentially the lowest value Dogecoin will drop to at current market conditions. The floor is currently 0.07 USD cents. Which is up from 0.008 USD cents just a few months ago.

10. Question: Should Dogecoin have a cap on its supply. Inflation and deflation Infinite supply / no cap vs cap in regarding to cryptocurrency.

Answer: First of all - the original developers of Dogecoin have already stated that they will NOT be adding a cap. Adding a cap fundamentally changes Dogecoin at its core level and they’re just not going to do it. Here is the direct answer from the Dogecoin developers: “The interest was already built by people trying to trick others in buying an asset they themselves do not understand and your link is to a petition that tricks people into asserting social pressure towards changing the core parameters of an asset that have been there since its launch.
We believe that what you're really doing is trying to get rich at the cost of others and when that failed because you ran out of victims and money, you come here asking us to bail you out. However, we will not bail you out, as with great freedom comes great responsibility. We take ours seriously and we hope that you will too in the future.
We have now closed this topic. Request denied.” - Patrick lodder Dogecoin developer. 

Second response
“A, block reward is needed to secure Dogecoin network in a decentralized manner. Dogecoin is merge-mined with Litecoin, and that makes it somewhat secure against PoW attacks. But if Dogecoin reward will be too low, some Litecoin miners may drop Dogecoin, and our security will suffer. From this point of view, bigger reward is better. If you propose reducing the reward over time, you must also propose a solid way to keep Dogecoin secure.
Now about the economic aspect. Current Dogecoin issue rate, taken relative to current total amount, is low, it's almost nothing compared to all the other factors that affect Dogecoin value. If you look at Dogecoin price chart since the introduction of current issue schedule, you will not see effects of ""inflation"" for all the wild price changes caused by other factors. And this already low issue rate gets even smaller over time, compared to total amount of dogecoins.
The only real reason for these ""cap"" proposals is trying to ""sell"" Dogecoin to investors under the premise of possibly increased scarcity in the future. In my opinion, we don't need to try to appeal to investors. Dogecoin value will be increasing because of strong community and increased usage. And the fact that Dogecoin value increases is already enough for investors to jump in and increase it even more.” 

You can read the full response to this directly from the developers here: https://github.com/dogecoin/dogecoin/issues/1674

Even if they DID add a cap it would actually be LESS beneficial for Dogecoin as a currency. 

Here’s some economics explaining why. Inflation and deflation are common economic terms used to explain the change in the inherent value of a currency. This means that that 1 US Dollar today does not have the same value or “worth” as it did, for example, in 1950. Inflation is a situation of rising prices in the economy. A more exact definition of inflation is a sustained increase in the general price level in an economy. Deflation on the other hand occurs when the inflation rate falls below 0%, that is a negative inflation rate. While inflation reduces the value of a currency over time, a sudden deflation of a currency increases its relative value. This would allow more goods and services to be bought than before with the same amount of currency. Deflation can be a factor in leading to a recession and also result in a deflationary spiral.
		
10a) What does all this mean with regards to cryptocurrency, specifically Bitcoin versus Dogecoin? 
		
		Well - Bitcoin is stagnant or deflationary over time, while Dogecoin is inflationary overtime. This is due to the way they are architected and mined, and how new coins are added into their respective markets - covered in other section. What gets misunderstood is which one is “better” or rather ""the lesser evil"".10b)	Dogecoin doesn't need a supply limit like Bitcoin, because in the long run it will be much easier to exchange Dogecoin for goods and services, than with other crypto currencies or regular currencies for that matter. If Bitcoin wants to become a real global currency with buying power, not just a speculation tool to exchange it for a few thousand debt based USD, when it hits a new record high every few months or years, its supply will have to grow inevitably. Our current money is backed by signatures on debt contracts, not on real values. But it works, because we believe in it, even if it will be our downfall if it continues like this. 
         Dogecoin is different. Dogecoin has a set amount of coins entering the market by the minute. There are plenty of spreadsheets out there showcasing exactly how much many Dogecoin will be in circulation at any given moment of time. People get confused because they think inflation is a bad thing, when in fact it is actually beneficial in small quantities and beneficial to the longevity of a currency.

Currencies have inflation - commodities don’t. Dogecoin is better suited to be a currency than Bitcoin is. Bitcoin is better suited to be a digital version of gold.

11. Question: Financial aspects of Dogecoin. Who will profit from it? What will happen if Dogecoin has exponential growth? A zero- sum game. Explaining that you only realize a loss or profit at then time of sell.

Answer: To clear things up - cryptocurrency is essentially what economist call a Zero Sum Game. A zero-sum game is a mathematical representation of a situation in which each participant's gain or loss of utility is exactly balanced by the losses or gains of the utility of the other participants. What this means is that across a group of people who engage in selling and buying Dogecoin, if one person gains another person loses. For example if you bought at 0.08 and sold at 0.03 someone made a profit of 0.05 cents per Dogecoin while you lost 0.05 cents per Dogecoin. The important thing to understand is that in these situations the only way you truly lose or gain anything is when you sell. You don’t realize your gains or losses until you complete that transaction. What this means is that if Dogecoin does increase exponentially the people who have been holding since the price has been low will gain astronomical returns on their investment, while others who joined late will not.
12. Question: Stability vs Volatility
Answer: This describes basically how stable something is over a set period of time. Volatility is how much prices change over time. Stabilization of Dogecoin is important for the overall health, however, cryptocurrencies are known to and will likely remain very volatile for the foreseeable future.

13a) Question: Pump and dump vs long term growth and the difference between them.

Answer: ""Pump and dump"" is a form of securities fraud that involves artificially inflating the price of an owned stock through false and misleading positive statements, in order to sell the cheaply purchased stock at a higher price. Pump and dumps are illegal. While a subset of people are trying to pump and dump Dogecoin, the legitimate community is focused its long term growth and stability which is achieved through the rest of the topics addressed here

13b - second perspective)
Essentially many people are just coming onto DOGE because it has low barrier to entry, and enticed by the idea of coming in low, selling what they have and running with the profits short term. This has lead to pumps and dips, and a lot of misinformation being thrown around. I should clarify some points for those who are coming in, instead of repeating the HODL and diamond hands rhetoric.
Planned pumps are not what Doge needs.
Pumps of this nature usually have an attached implication, which is that people will plan on selling, capitalising on the hype and then buying low to wait for the next pump. This leads to money being taken out of the coin, resulting in the lower price we now see. This means that planned pumps are essentially feeding sellers. We are not doing this in secret. This is a public forum and people with the intention have the information needed to drain us dry if we let them.
Essentially, if we want Doge to grow, planned pumps need to stop being openly advertised, or they need to die altogether. Of the two, the latter is the easiest, and it is what this post will be focusing on.
Sustainable Growth is now the way.
Pumps are fine when they're unpredicted - Elon Musk is living proof of that. However, planned pumps will result in our good boy coin shooting down to the dips, where sellers can reinvest and wait to harvest our money again at the next pump.
If however, we grow the price slowly, the floor will increase in a much more stable fashion, resulting in smaller dips. This will mean that the insane dips where sellers truly farm their coin at become very inhospitable to them, as they'd need to put more and more money to receive less and less profit. Essentially, by slowly growing the coin with organic 'food' instead of steroids, we can slowly choke out those parasites who are ruining the growth of the coin by making every dip a horrible investment for their time and efforts.
Sure, buy at the dips. Sure, hold the coin. But don't plan any more pumps. The less room you give to the sellers, the doubters and the paper hands, the more coin you can collect and the more profit that awaits you in the future.
Conclusion
If we come together as a community, Doge will truly live up to the hype - the people's currency. If we choose to continue listening to planned pumps, we have a very difficult, long and risky road ahead of us. Sustainable growth will beat large planned spikes any day.
14. Question: Elon Musk - Is he important for Dogecoin? The impact of celebrities and big business supporting Dogecoin Celebrity/Influencer Involvement

Answer: Elon Musk, Mark Cuban
As many may know, Elon is highly involved when it comes to “meme culture.” we can see Elon has tweeted several times concerning “doge,” reposting memes found from Reddit, as well as concerning himself with the ripples of the recent stock news. Mark Cuban, another notable wealthy, down-to-earth, community-involved individual, has recently mentioned “#dogecoin” specifically. Regardless of whether these people have positive intentions towards $DOGE or not, their mention carries weight and public opinion and is a good assumption that new eyes are looking at us as a result. It should be noted that they have tweeted neutrally to positively towards $DOGE, not indicating a full-send support but they clearly are not talking down the possibilities.

Big business allowing Dogecoin to be supported as means of exchanging goods, and people like Elon musk supporting and backing this cryptocurrency are important to proving its value and legitimacy. 

However, it is important to remember that this is not the sole determining factor in the price. The price is determined by everything covered above. 

15. Question: Is getting Dogecoin to increase to the equivalent of one US dollar possible? Can and will it really happen? What will change if it does happen? How high can Dogecoin realistically rise in price? Market cap explanation and comparison to US currency and global FIAT currency. 
	
Answer: Yes, despite not having a fixed or capped supply, the value of the currency can rise based on its relative value against other currencies in the market. You can find examples of this in the FOREX market where currency pairs are traded, like Euro against US dollar, or US Dollar against Japanese Yen. As the value of Dogecoin rises, more and more businesses will recognise its potential and importance, and subsequently begin to accept it in exchange for goods and services. This will also help to grow the developer community around Dogecoin.

Market cap = price x supply. Price is determined by supply and demand (buying snd selling of Dogecoin. Supply is determined by mining Dogecoin. 

The current market cap of Dogecoin while writing this article is 9,000,000,000 (9 billion). if Dogecoin were to reach $1 today it would have a market cap of 128 billion dollars. Since the current supply of Dogecoin Is 128 billion in circulation. Bitcoin (the most successful cryptocurrency currently has a market cap of approximately 700,000,000,000 (700 billion dollars). This means that at $1 the total supply of Dogecoin would be “worth” about 1/7th of Bitcoins total supply. The estimated supply of the US dollar is 2,000,000,000 (2 trillion) since 1 dollar = 1 dollar (LOLZ) the market cap of the US currency is 2 trillion. If Dogecoin were to reach this market cap - the price can be calculated through dividing the market cap (2 trillion) by the supply (128 billion). This means that dogecoin would equal the entire US currency’s (M0 money supply in economics) at $15.60. This is definitely not impossible but highly highly improbable to ever reach this value any time soon. As in like 3-10 years away minimum. Now the entire supply of the entire worlds fiat (paper) currency is 37 trillion dollars. You can apply the same logic from above and see that the value would be $288.60 This is the theoretical limit to how much Dogecoin can be worth due simply to the fact that if it was valued at anymore than that amount it would be “worth” more than the entire world’s paper currencies combined which is not possible without adding more supply. It’s important to note that this number is not static. Which means if the market conditions change such as an increase in supply or change in price the numbers will change. 

16. Question: What is a 51% attack? Can it realistically happen? What are the implications if it were to happen?
Answer: A 51% attack refers to an attack on a blockchain most commonly bitcoin. Such an attack is possible but still just hypothetical. It requires group of miners to control more than 50% of the network's mining hash rate or computing power.

The attackers would be able to prevent new transactions from gaining confirmations, allowing them to halt payments between some or all users. They would also be able to reverse transactions that were completed while they were in control of the network, meaning they could double-spend coin. 

They would almost certainly not be able to create new coins or alter old blocks. A 51% attack would probably not destroy bitcoin or another blockchain-based currency outright, even if it proved highly damaging.

You may have seen an article going around talking about the 51% attack and why it will cause Dogecoin to go to zero. Regarding the 51% Hashrate attacks, Yes, they are real, and have been ever since cryptocurrencies aka Bitcoin started. The article even mentions an example. Now, if a large group of people with a lot of resources very effectively coordinated, they could indeed make a 51% attack on Dogecoin happen. But not just on Dogecoin, but also on many other, small cryptocurrencies. This is nothing new, this has basically been known for the last 10+ years. But the author of the article needs clicks, so there goes the horror-scenario headline... Possible - yes, absolutely. Likely, not very. Unless you have a large sum of people with a few resources each coordinating perfectly - that is in my honest opinion very unlikely - you could have governments, very large hedge funds, or maybe Elon Musk build a vast array of mining farms and do said 51% Hashrate attack. But again, that effort would only be worthwhile if those groups had a definite interest in destroying Dogecoin. There are probably other cryptocurrencies that would be more interesting from that perspective, such as litecoin. Of course, despite the sensationalist headline, for them clicks, the author covers their own backside by stating the following:
""In conclusion...Pretty much all the crypto besides Bitcoin and Ethereum are at material risk of a 51% attack, and it's not just a theoretical risk."" This problem is not tied specifically to Dogecoin, but to every single cryptocurrency. Now let’s do some math to calculate exactly how much it would cost in order to succeed in pulling off a 51% attack on Dogecoin. Dogecoin has a hash rate of 299.17 TH/s or 299,170,000 MH/s. If you were to use an RTX3090 which costs $2,000 US Dollars, and has a hash rate of 121 MH/s. You would need 1,260,964 RTX3090 at a cost of $2,521,928,926 dollars ($2.5 billion). Is it possible? Yes. Is it likely? No. 

17. Question: There is a lack of developer support for Dogecoin. The technology is outdated. Why would anyone come work as a Dogecoin developer when there are thousands of other cryptocurrencies? 

Answer: the original Dogecoin developers have already began working on the project with the new found support of the community and companies accepting Dogecoin as payment. The short answer is there is already development being done due to recent weeks bringing Dogecoin back into relevancy. 

The long answer is this: Given the recent surge in Altcoins, both from a financial perspective and media coverage, there is now a very good chance that new developers will come back to Dogecoin in time. There are plenty of people with coding experience, also those who have already worked on cryptocurrency concepts in general.

As of early 2021, there are around 4000 cryptocurrencies in existance, probably several thousand more hidden as drafts or stealth projects. These days, there are well-paid positions in the up-and-coming cryptocurrency space.  There is, as always, a shortage of developers.  Thus, how can Dogecoin compete with the wider market and successfully attract developers? Well, there are a number of different reasons Dogecoin will be able to attract good developers. 
Basically, why does anyone work on anything? Why did the original Dogecoin developers even create Dogecoin in the first place? For fun, because it was interesting, because Bitcoin got the ball rolling, to be part of something exciting. 

Remember - when Bitcoin was created were those developers simply looking for short-term financial gain? No, they were likely not. Bitcoin took a while to take off. And so did Dogecoin. Bitcoin has inherent limitations for day-to-day use, while Dogecoin has received too little attention over the past few years in terms of development. But, the idea that developers will not work on Dogecoin is just a big misconception. Dogecoin is becoming too popular for developers to stay away. 

Also, once Dogecoin legitimatizes itself more widely, working on the project as a developer will become inherently more valuable, both financially and non-financially, due to the fact that it will make its way back in the top tier cryptocurrencies.",22.0,2021-02-13 22:13:43,0.93
Misconceptions Regarding Dogecoin and Cryptocurrency (REVISED V1.2),"This is a revised version of my previous article. I am going to try to update frequently. 

Version 1.2 has the following changes
- added new questions based on feedback from the community 
- Updated some of the spelling errors and minor typos. I don’t have an English degree 😂. The information is still factual though. If you see something glaringly wrong just comment or message me and I’ll fix it.
- Updated some of the numbers to reflect current data
- Rearranged the order of the questions to build upon each other better
- I had to shorten certain answers to fit the length requirement. 


This information below is important. I ask that you please take the time to read this entire post before making judgment or commenting. My discord group of over 100 people have grouped together the majority of the most asked questioned and misunderstandings regarding Dogecoin, into the following 20 key points. Even if you know the answers to some of these please read the entire post. Please read them below. 

1. Question: What is Dogecoin?

Answer: Dogecoin (/ˈdoʊdʒkɔɪn/ DOHJ-koyn, code: DOGE, symbol: Ð) is a cryptocurrency invented by software engineers Billy Markus and Jackson Palmer, who decided to create a payment system that is instant, fun, and free from traditional banking fees. Dogecoin features the face of the Shiba Inu dog from the popular ""Doge"" meme as its logo and namesake. It was introduced on December 6, 2013, and quickly developed its own online community reaching a market capitalization of US $5,382,875,000 on January 28, 2021. [Wikipedia, 20210203]

2.  Question: Why Dogecoin?

Answer: For the Lolz. Well, not quite. Initially as a purely meme-driven alternative to the likes of Bitcoin and Litecoin, Dogecoin in-fact boasts very low transaction fees and fast transaction times, very little network congestion, and most importantly, is designed to be used as a daily means of exchange, like your morning cup of coffee. Also, it is really fun, and who doesn't like the Dog ?!
		
1/2 - second perspective) Question: What Is Dogecoin? And why Dogecoin?

Answer: Back a few years ago, some crazy people banded together in support of a cryptocurrency known as Dogecoin. Similar to other cryptocurrencies, Dogecoin, the people's crypto, finds itself with the support of hundreds if not thousands of individuals pushing for this currency to succeed. But why is that? Unless you have been absent from every social bubble, you may have heard of Bitcoin. For the purpose of this explanation, you will find that Bitcoin is not exactly an easy thing to equate to Dogecoin, but lets think about the criteria of a Cryptocurrency.Bitcoin did not find its foothold overnight. In fact, it took several years. A lot of people fought tooth and nail for their belief in the coin. Crypto, in a nutshell, is a decentralized form of currency that finds its value in a combination of individual asset involvement, ease or difficulty in security of an exchange, creating a method of reliable, secure, trustworthy exchange, and other reasons. 

Think of it like this: to exchange goods and services without currency, one must barter. I can barter a service (a haircut, for example) towards someone who needs a haircut, and in exchange they can barter a good or service to me.Currency then becomes an ""IOU"" (I Owe yoU) so that, if somebody needs me to cut their hair, they can give me an IOU for a good or service they control. When enough people begin adopting this, a centralized currency eventually takes hold. Crypto seeks to take this a step further and, insteal of relying on building up a centalization in terms of valuable metals or debt, it is built up solely on the exchange of goods and services. Dogecoin, compared to other cryptocurrencies, finds itself in a strange position where the origins did NOT see it soaring to the moon in any situation. Funny how things can change in time. Dogecoin has pros and cons to it. Comparing it to other cryptos, it does not face a supply cap like Bitcoin does. It is not a directly equated asset, such as how Bitcoin can be attributed as a digital gold asset. Mining dogecoin is also much simpler (comparitively) and does not face difficulty spikes, a source of Bitcoin slow-down. In essence, in 50 years, Dogecoin will still be around, still be mined, still be traded. Bitcoin will cease to be created, hoarded, and become the digital currency of the affluent.

3. Question: Places to buy dogecoin places where you can spend Dogecoin? 

Answer: Refer to r/dogecoin posts by the moderators for a list of businesses that accept doge as payment. 

4. Question: Cryptocurrencies vs stocks. The main differences between them. 
		
Answer:  
A stock is a type of investment that represents an ownership share in a company. Investors buy stocks that they think will go up in value over time. ... A stock is an investment. When you purchase a company's stock, you're purchasing a small piece of that company, called a share. 

A cryptocurrency:  (crypto for short) is a digital a sset designed to work as a medium of exchange wherein individual coin ownership records are stored in a ledger existing in a form of computerized database using strong cryptography to secure transaction records, to control the creation of additional coins, and to verify the transfer of coin ownership. It typically does not exist in physical form (like paper money) and is typically not issued by a central authority. Cryptocurrencies typically use decentralized control as opposed to centralized digital currency and central banking systems. When a cryptocurrency is minted or created prior to issuance or issued by a single issuer, it is generally considered centralized. When implemented with decentralized control, each cryptocurrency works through distributed ledger technology, typically a blockchain, that serves as a public financial transaction database.

When comparing crypto to stocks, the main thing to keep in mind is that cryptocurrencies have few if any regulations applied to them. It is still the ""wild west"" of trading. You can be scammed, skimmed, pumped-dumped, as so forth, much more often and more easily than with stocks. Terminology is similar to exact between the two, but both require a certain mindset. Crypto is almost always a long-haul game, where stocks can be short play or long haul. Cryptocurrency is literally money. Cryptocurrencies intended purpose is to use it to exchange goods and services. The way paper money is. 

5. Question: Is Dogecoin a product of the Wallstreet Bets movement? What differentiates dogecoin from GME/AMC?

Answer: no. The rest of this article explains why. 
6. Question: Difference between cold storage, internet wallets and Robinhood

Answer: 
Coldstorage - in the cryptocurrency world cold storage refers to physical objects/devices that contain your cryptocurrency. 

Wallets are an electronic program of service that stores your cryptocurrency. There a number of different wallets - but I personally use Dogecoin.info

Robhinhood- as of right now robinhood does not actually give you cryptocurrency when purchased through them. From Robhinhood’s cryptocurrency page: “We don’t currently provide you with access to your wallet or your wallet address.
You own the cryptocurrency assets in your account, and you can buy or sell them at any time. We’re evaluating features to allow you to safely transfer coins to and from Robinhood, and we’ll update you when these features are available.” If you would
Like to use your Dogecoin or cryptocurrency in general for exchange of goods and services - it is recommended to either ask Robinhood who to give us access to our wallets or find another exchange. 


7. Question: Dogecoin vs Bitcoin - their competitive advantages and disadvantages. Answer: information explaining the advantages and disadvantages of Bitcoin vs Dogecoin will be explained throughout this article. 
8. Question: Is Dogecoin a meme or should it be taken seriously? 

Answer: We have all witnessed the power of a meme, the depths it can reach in society, especially in recent years. We have seen it many times before with video games, consoles, Oreos, or as of late even toilet paper... A meme has inherent value in the form of “widespread information”. A meme can spread an idea across diverse communities, and even entire countries literally overnight. This can bring about lasting effects on culture and society. If correctly taken advantage of, Doge can become the dominant meme currency of the internet, and amass real-world value just by being a popular, recognisable meme itself. This is where the saying “Dogecoin is the people’s coin” comes from. This is marketing 101. If your idea, or product is too complicated or not enough people know about then it doesn’t matter how technologically sound it is. Dogecoin have the best technology? No. Can it be improved upon. Definitely. In fact, the original developers have started working on the project again. An analogy I like to use is this. McDonald’s makes hamburgers. They have a clown as a mascot. A literal personification of a joke. Does make McDonald’s make the best hamburgers? No. Does McDonald’s have “value” in their industry? Undeniably so. So what does McDonald’s do correctly? They provide a cheap, easily accessible, and brand able product to the masses. Which is what dogecoin does for cryptocurrency. 

9. Question: Mining Dogecoin. How new Dogecoin are created and enter the market/supply. Is there an infinite supply of Dogecoin being produced? Comparison to Bitcoin and the US dollar. 

Answer:
mining is the process of creating new cryptocurrency by solving a computational puzzle. mining is necessary to maintain the ledger of transactions upon which cryptocurrency is based. Miners have become very sophisticated over the last several years using complex machinery to speed up mining operations. Approximately 600,000 dogecoins are produced per hour and 5,256,000,000 (5.26 billion) per year and there are currently approximately 128,000,000,000 (128 billion) Dogecoin. Now let’s compare this information to what we know about Bitcoin. Bitcoin currently has a supply of 18.5 million. Currently 900 Bitcoin are mined per day or 328,500 per year. However, unlike Dogecoin, Bitcoins mining rate is not fixed. Bitcoin has something known as a Bitcoin halving which means at some point in the future instead of 900 per day being mined 450 are mined. Now let’s compare Dogecoin and Bitcoin to the US Dollar. The US Dollar has an estimated paper money supply (more on this covered in a later section) of approximately (1.2 to 2 trillion) and in 2019 the federal reserve printed 188.3 billion paper dollars. This means that there is 10 times more supply of dollars to Dogecoin and the government prints 37 times more dollars than Dogecoin is mined per year. It is also important to note that this increase in supply of Dogecoin is fixed. It never changes. The federal reserve can change how much they print any given year. Many people think that this means that the supply of Dogecoin is infinite or infinitely increasing. That is not true in the span of our life time. It will take approximately 24 years for the supply of Dogecoin to double and it will take 360 years for the supply of Dogecoin to reach the current supply of the US Dollar. That’s without taking into account the fact that federal reserve adds more dollars each year than Dogecoin adds to its supply each year. Technically speaking the supply of Dogecoin will eventually reach infinity if given enough time but you have to remember that infinity isn’t an actual number. You can’t mine “infinite” dogecoin because infinity isn’t a number. It’s a mathematical concept to describe something that is boundless. Dogecoin doesn’t have a boundless increase. It has a fixed increase a set amount added at a specific interval. So in practical terms for the purpose of using Dogecoin as a legitimate currency, this infinite argument against Dogecoin doesn’t matter. In fact it’s actually way better than Bitcoin at exchanging goods and services because of this fact. That is why the price per Bitcoin is 40,000 dollars and the price per Dogecoin is .07 with a realistic possibility of only reaching $288.60 at current market conditions. That is why it costs .00012 Bitcoin for milk but only 50 Dogecoin for that same commonly traded commodity. That’s why Bitcoin will be treated like digital gold. That is why Dogecoin will be considered the next dollar. The price per coin are inherently different because their supplies are different. More will be covered on this topic on another section of this article. 

10. Question: Does Dogecoin have value? How does Dogecoin increase in price or decrease in price? 

Answer: Yes. Dogecoin has value. It is currently valued at between .06 and .08 as of writing this. If didn’t have value then it wouldn’t be bought or sold at all. Anything can have value as long as enough people assign it value and agree to it. The value of any means of exchange is fundamentally driven by supply and demand. If two parties agree that X amount of asset A is roughly worth the same as Y amount of asset B, you effectively have established a market.  That’s why the US dollar and other fiat currency has value even though it just a piece of paper. The difference between fiat currency and cryptocurrency is that fiat currency is determined by centralized government and other underlying economical/market conditions. Cryptocurrency is meant to be a decentralized form of fiat currency. Now as to why the price changes from say .05 to .06 (random numbers using this as an example for explanation purposes. It is not exact) this value is driven primarily by supply and demand. We already know the supply of Dogecoin, so for the purpose of this the main driving factor in the change in price is demand. But the demand for Dogecoin isn’t just one person. It’s the entire group of people who own Dogecoin. So if at any given time lets say 10 people with 1000 Dogecoin want to sell. But only 5 people want to buy 1000 Dogecoin. This means that the sellers “value” Dogecoin less at its current price than buyers do. 5000 Dogecoin less. This changes to price from .05 to .49. The same applies if more people wanted to buy. Then the price would go from .05 to .051. An algorithm repeats the process over and over constantly updating the price. However that’s only one way to change the value. The best way to increase the overall value of the currency in the long run is by eventually by exchanging your coins for goods, services, or just by tipping and trading with other Dogecoin holders. This gives Dogecoin utility. Which basically means that it can be used for something other than just buying Dogecoin at .05 and selling it .06. That is why you see people pushing to accept Dogecoin as payment. If legitimatize Dogecoin as a cryptocurrency and currency when companies allow you to exchange it for goods and services. 


8. Question: Circulation of currencies. The importance of buying, selling, and holding - and the differences between them. 
		
Answer: To briefly explain this, a lot of people have been saying “buy and hold” or “I’m never selling!” - which in itself is great start. But there remains a lot of misinformation around the topic, for example that simply ""buying and holding Doge"" will drive up the price indefinitely. Unfortunately, that is just not true. Buying, holding, and selling are all intricately connected with each other. ALL of those three states are essential for a (digital) currency to flourish. Holding does neither hurt or raise the value of the asset, but rather it helps to establish a baseline, which is also called ""setting a floor"". Those who have diligently kept on holding their coins, have allowed Dogecoin to stabilize at roughly 0.07 USD cents for the past few days. Remember, this remains a huge gain from where Dogecoin has been just weeks ago. The reason the price is not changing much from this baseline right now is because few are buying and few are selling their Dogecoin, specifically due to topics which will be covered in other sections here. However, an active circulation of a currency is critical to establishing it as an effective means of exchanging goods and setting it up for long term growth. More on the value of Dogecoin in another section. 
	9. Question: Establishing a floor or a baseline.

Answer: The day to day trends of Dogecoin may appear strange at first sight, but those who continue holding onto their Doge are affecting or rather creating the floor. The floor is essentially the lowest value Dogecoin will drop to at current market conditions. The floor is currently 0.07 USD cents. Which is up from 0.008 USD cents just a few months ago.

10. Question: Should Dogecoin have a cap on its supply. Inflation and deflation Infinite supply / no cap vs cap in regarding to cryptocurrency.

Answer: First of all - the original developers of Dogecoin have already stated that they will NOT be adding a cap. Adding a cap fundamentally changes Dogecoin at its core level and they’re just not going to do it. Here is the direct answer from the Dogecoin developers: “The interest was already built by people trying to trick others in buying an asset they themselves do not understand and your link is to a petition that tricks people into asserting social pressure towards changing the core parameters of an asset that have been there since its launch.
We believe that what you're really doing is trying to get rich at the cost of others and when that failed because you ran out of victims and money, you come here asking us to bail you out. However, we will not bail you out, as with great freedom comes great responsibility. We take ours seriously and we hope that you will too in the future.
We have now closed this topic. Request denied.” - Patrick lodder Dogecoin developer. 

Second response
“A, block reward is needed to secure Dogecoin network in a decentralized manner. Dogecoin is merge-mined with Litecoin, and that makes it somewhat secure against PoW attacks. But if Dogecoin reward will be too low, some Litecoin miners may drop Dogecoin, and our security will suffer. From this point of view, bigger reward is better. If you propose reducing the reward over time, you must also propose a solid way to keep Dogecoin secure.
Now about the economic aspect. Current Dogecoin issue rate, taken relative to current total amount, is low, it's almost nothing compared to all the other factors that affect Dogecoin value. If you look at Dogecoin price chart since the introduction of current issue schedule, you will not see effects of ""inflation"" for all the wild price changes caused by other factors. And this already low issue rate gets even smaller over time, compared to total amount of dogecoins.
The only real reason for these ""cap"" proposals is trying to ""sell"" Dogecoin to investors under the premise of possibly increased scarcity in the future. In my opinion, we don't need to try to appeal to investors. Dogecoin value will be increasing because of strong community and increased usage. And the fact that Dogecoin value increases is already enough for investors to jump in and increase it even more.” 

You can read the full response to this directly from the developers here: https://github.com/dogecoin/dogecoin/issues/1674

Even if they DID add a cap it would actually be LESS beneficial for Dogecoin as a currency. Her

Here’s some
Basic economics explaining why. Inflation and deflation are common economic terms used to explain the change in the inherent value of a currency. This means that that 1 US Dollar today does not have the same value or “worth” as it did, for example, in 1950. Inflation is a situation of rising prices in the economy. A more exact definition of inflation is a sustained increase in the general price level in an economy. Deflation on the other hand occurs when the inflation rate falls below 0%, that is a negative inflation rate. While inflation reduces the value of a currency over time, a sudden deflation of a currency increases its relative value. This would allow more goods and services to be bought than before with the same amount of currency. Deflation can be a factor in leading to a recession and also result in a deflationary spiral.
		
10a) What does all this mean with regards to cryptocurrency, specifically Bitcoin versus Dogecoin? 
		
		Well - Bitcoin is stagnant or deflationary over time, while Dogecoin is inflationary overtime. This is due to the way they are architected and mined, and how new coins are added into their respective markets - covered in other section. What gets misunderstood is which one is “better” or rather ""the lesser evil"".10b)	Dogecoin doesn't need a supply limit like Bitcoin, because in the long run it will be much easier to exchange Dogecoin for goods and services, than with other crypto currencies or regular currencies for that matter. If Bitcoin wants to become a real global currency with buying power, not just a speculation tool to exchange it for a few thousand debt based USD, when it hits a new record high every few months or years, its supply will have to grow inevitably. Our current money is backed by signatures on debt contracts, not on real values. But it works, because we believe in it, even if it will be our downfall if it continues like this. 
         Dogecoin is different. Dogecoin has a set amount of coins entering the market by the minute. There are plenty of spreadsheets out there showcasing exactly how much many Dogecoin will be in circulation at any given moment of time. People get confused because they think inflation is a bad thing, when in fact it is actually beneficial in small quantities and beneficial to the longevity of a currency.

Currencies have inflation - commodities don’t. Dogecoin is better suited to be a currency than Bitcoin is. Bitcoin is better suited to be a digital version of gold.

11. Question: Financial aspects of Dogecoin. Who will profit from it? What will happen if Dogecoin has exponential growth? A zero- sum game. Explaining that you only realize a loss or profit at then time of sell.

Answer: To clear things up - cryptocurrency is essentially what economist call a Zero Sum Game. A zero-sum game is a mathematical representation of a situation in which each participant's gain or loss of utility is exactly balanced by the losses or gains of the utility of the other participants. What this means is that across a group of people who engage in selling and buying Dogecoin, if one person gains another person loses. For example if you bought at 0.08 and sold at 0.03 someone made a profit of 0.05 cents per Dogecoin while you lost 0.05 cents per Dogecoin. The important thing to understand is that in these situations the only way you truly lose or gain anything is when you sell. You don’t realize your gains or losses until you complete that transaction. What this means is that if Dogecoin does increase exponentially the people who have been holding since the price has been low will gain astronomical returns on their investment, while others who joined late will not.
12. Question: Stability vs Volatility
Answer: This describes basically how stable something is over a set period of time. Volatility is how much prices change over time. Stabilization of Dogecoin is important for the overall health, however, cryptocurrencies are known to and will likely remain very volatile for the foreseeable future.

13a) Question: Pump and dump vs long term growth and the difference between them.

Answer: ""Pump and dump"" is a form of securities fraud that involves artificially inflating the price of an owned stock through false and misleading positive statements, in order to sell the cheaply purchased stock at a higher price. Pump and dumps are illegal. While a subset of people are trying to pump and dump Dogecoin, the legitimate community is focused its long term growth and stability which is achieved through the rest of the topics addressed here

13b - second perspective)
Essentially many people are just coming onto DOGE because it has low barrier to entry, and enticed by the idea of coming in low, selling what they have and running with the profits short term. This has lead to pumps and dips, and a lot of misinformation being thrown around. I should clarify some points for those who are coming in, instead of repeating the HODL and diamond hands rhetoric.
Planned pumps are not what Doge needs.
Pumps of this nature usually have an attached implication, which is that people will plan on selling, capitalising on the hype and then buying low to wait for the next pump. This leads to money being taken out of the coin, resulting in the lower price we now see. This means that planned pumps are essentially feeding sellers. We are not doing this in secret. This is a public forum and people with the intention have the information needed to drain us dry if we let them.
Essentially, if we want Doge to grow, planned pumps need to stop being openly advertised, or they need to die altogether. Of the two, the latter is the easiest, and it is what this post will be focusing on.
Sustainable Growth is now the way.
Pumps are fine when they're unpredicted - Elon Musk is living proof of that. However, planned pumps will result in our good boy coin shooting down to the dips, where sellers can reinvest and wait to harvest our money again at the next pump.
If however, we grow the price slowly, the floor will increase in a much more stable fashion, resulting in smaller dips. This will mean that the insane dips where sellers truly farm their coin at become very inhospitable to them, as they'd need to put more and more money to receive less and less profit. Essentially, by slowly growing the coin with organic 'food' instead of steroids, we can slowly choke out those parasites who are ruining the growth of the coin by making every dip a horrible investment for their time and efforts.
Sure, buy at the dips. Sure, hold the coin. But don't plan any more pumps. The less room you give to the sellers, the doubters and the paper hands, the more coin you can collect and the more profit that awaits you in the future.
Conclusion
If we come together as a community, Doge will truly live up to the hype - the people's currency. If we choose to continue listening to planned pumps, we have a very difficult, long and risky road ahead of us. Sustainable growth will beat large planned spikes any day.
14. Question: Elon Musk - Is he important for Dogecoin? The impact of celebrities and big business supporting Dogecoin Celebrity/Influencer Involvement

Answer: Elon Musk, Mark Cuban
As many may know, Elon is highly involved when it comes to “meme culture.” we can see Elon has tweeted several times concerning “doge,” reposting memes found from Reddit, as well as concerning himself with the ripples of the recent stock news. Mark Cuban, another notable wealthy, down-to-earth, community-involved individual, has recently mentioned “#dogecoin” specifically. Regardless of whether these people have positive intentions towards $DOGE or not, their mention carries weight and public opinion and is a good assumption that new eyes are looking at us as a result. It should be noted that they have tweeted neutrally to positively towards $DOGE, not indicating a full-send support but they clearly are not talking down the possibilities.

Big business allowing Dogecoin to be supported as means of exchanging goods, and people like Elon musk supporting and backing this cryptocurrency are important to proving its value and legitimacy. 

However, it is important to remember that this is not the sole determining factor in the price. The price is determined by everything covered above. 

15. Question: Is getting Dogecoin to increase to the equivalent of one US dollar possible? Can and will it really happen? What will change if it does happen? How high can Dogecoin realistically rise in price? Market cap explanation and comparison to US currency and global FIAT currency. 
	
Answer: Yes, despite not having a fixed or capped supply, the value of the currency can rise based on its relative value against other currencies in the market. You can find examples of this in the FOREX market where currency pairs are traded, like Euro against US dollar, or US Dollar against Japanese Yen. As the value of Dogecoin rises, more and more businesses will recognise its potential and importance, and subsequently begin to accept it in exchange for goods and services. This will also help to grow the developer community around Dogecoin.

Market cap = price x supply. Price is determined by supply and demand (buying snd selling of Dogecoin. Supply is determined by mining Dogecoin. 

The current market cap of Dogecoin while writing this article is 9,000,000,000 (9 billion). if Dogecoin were to reach $1 today it would have a market cap of 128 billion dollars. Since the current supply of Dogecoin Is 128 billion in circulation. Bitcoin (the most successful cryptocurrency currently has a market cap of approximately 700,000,000,000 (700 billion dollars). This means that at $1 the total supply of Dogecoin would be “worth” about 1/7th of Bitcoins total supply. The estimated supply of the US dollar is 2,000,000,000 (2 trillion) since 1 dollar = 1 dollar (LOLZ) the market cap of the US currency is 2 trillion. If Dogecoin were to reach this market cap - the price can be calculated through dividing the market cap (2 trillion) by the supply (128 billion). This means that dogecoin would equal the entire US currency’s (M0 money supply in economics) at $15.60. This is definitely not impossible but highly highly improbable to ever reach this value any time soon. As in like 3-10 years away minimum. Now the entire supply of the entire worlds fiat (paper) currency is 37 trillion dollars. You can apply the same logic from above and see that the value would be $288.60 This is the theoretical limit to how much Dogecoin can be worth due simply to the fact that if it was valued at anymore than that amount it would be “worth” more than the entire world’s paper currencies combined which is not possible without adding more supply. It’s important to note that this number is not static. Which means if the market conditions change such as an increase in supply or change in price the numbers will change. 

17. Question: What is a 51% attack? Can it realistically happen? What are the implications if it were to happen?
Answer: A 51% attack refers to an attack on a blockchain most commonly bitcoin. Such an attack is possible but still just hypothetical. It requires group of miners to control more than 50% of the network's mining hash rate or computing power.

The attackers would be able to prevent new transactions from gaining confirmations, allowing them to halt payments between some or all users. They would also be able to reverse transactions that were completed while they were in control of the network, meaning they could double-spend coin. 

They would almost certainly not be able to create new coins or alter old blocks. A 51% attack would probably not destroy bitcoin or another blockchain-based currency outright, even if it proved highly damaging.

You may have seen an article going around talking about the 51% attack and why it will cause Dogecoin to go to zero. Regarding the 51% Hashrate attacks, Yes, they are real, and have been ever since cryptocurrencies aka Bitcoin started. The article even mentions an example. Now, if a large group of people with a lot of resources very effectively coordinated, they could indeed make a 51% attack on Dogecoin happen. But not just on Dogecoin, but also on many other, small cryptocurrencies. This is nothing new, this has basically been known for the last 10+ years. But the author of the article needs clicks, so there goes the horror-scenario headline... Possible - yes, absolutely. Likely, not very. Unless you have a large sum of people with a few resources each coordinating perfectly - that is in my honest opinion very unlikely - you could have governments, very large hedge funds, or maybe Elon Musk build a vast array of mining farms and do said 51% Hashrate attack. But again, that effort would only be worthwhile if those groups had a definite interest in destroying Dogecoin. There are probably other cryptocurrencies that would be more interesting from that perspective, such as litecoin. Of course, despite the sensationalist headline, for them clicks, the author covers their own backside by stating the following:
""In conclusion...Pretty much all the crypto besides Bitcoin and Ethereum are at material risk of a 51% attack, and it's not just a theoretical risk."" This problem is not tied specifically to Dogecoin, but to every single cryptocurrency. Now let’s do some math to calculate exactly how much it would cost in order to succeed in pulling off a 51% attack on Dogecoin. Dogecoin has a hash rate of 299.17 TH/s or 299,170,000 MH/s. If you were to use an RTX3090 which costs $2,000 US Dollars, and has a hash rate of 121 MH/s. You would need 1,260,964 RTX3090 at a cost of $2,521,928,926 dollars ($2.5 billion). Is it possible? Yes. Is it likely? No. 

18. Question: There is a lack of developer support for Dogecoin. The technology is outdated. Why would anyone come work as a Dogecoin developer when there are thousands of other cryptocurrencies? 

Answer: the original Dogecoin developers have already began working on the project with the new found support of the community and companies accepting Dogecoin as payment. The short answer is there is already development being done due to recent weeks bringing Dogecoin back into relevancy. 

The long answer is this: Given the recent surge in Altcoins, both from a financial perspective and media coverage, there is now a very good chance that new developers will come back to Dogecoin in time. There are plenty of people with coding experience, also those who have already worked on cryptocurrency concepts in general.

As of early 2021, there are around 4000 cryptocurrencies in existance, probably several thousand more hidden as drafts or stealth projects. These days, there are well-paid positions in the up-and-coming cryptocurrency space.  There is, as always, a shortage of developers.  Thus, how can Dogecoin compete with the wider market and successfully attract developers? Well, there are a number of different reasons Dogecoin will be able to attract good developers. 
Basically, why does anyone work on anything? Why did the original Dogecoin developers even create Dogecoin in the first place? For fun, because it was interesting, because Bitcoin got the ball rolling, to be part of something exciting. 

Remember - when Bitcoin was created were those developers simply looking for short-term financial gain? No, they were likely not. Bitcoin took a while to take off. And so did Dogecoin. Bitcoin has inherent limitations for day-to-day use, while Dogecoin has received too little attention over the past few years in terms of development. But, the idea that developers will not work on Dogecoin is just a big misconception. Dogecoin is becoming too popular for developers to stay away. 

Also, once Dogecoin legitimatizes itself more widely, working on the project as a developer will become inherently more valuable, both financially and non-financially, due to the fact that it will make its way back in the top tier cryptocurrencies. 

19. Question: if all of the above information is true why the r/cryptocurrency full of people who are trying to discredit Dogecoin as legitimate cryptocurrency.  

Answer: The r/cryptocurrency is horribly misinformed. R/cryptocurrency is a specific subset of society who has an extremely knowledgeable background in computer science and computer coding.  They may have a solid understanding of the technology aspect of cryptocurrency but the reason why Dogecoin will be successful is based on economics, mathematics, social theory and statistics as WELL as the underlying technology. Each of these topics is extremely intricate and each field requires years to fully master. No one person has all of the knowledge of all aspects of a cryptocurrency so when someone is attacking Dogecoin on why it won’t be successful is probably misinformed. Dogecoin is already successful. It’s been proven already. The question is HOW successful. Which nobody really knows the answer to. r/cryptocurrency is full of gatekeepers who horde their knowledge while the Dogecoin community is focused on explaining and educating new people. R/cryptocurrency is notorious for being extremely serious and feel threatened that something that started at as a joke/meme has the potential to be at cryptocurrencies intended purpose - exchanging goods and services - than Bitcoin or any other popular cryptocurrency which is deflationary in nature.

20. Question: Will cryptocurrency replace fiat currency. Will cryptocurrency be the next world currency. Will the next world currency be Dogecoin?
Answer: 
People don’t realize the worldwide paradigm that is taking place right in front of our eyes. People are starting to see that traditional fiat (paper) currency back by centralized governments and debt are flawed and can be improved upon. Cryptocurrency is the future whether the people who can’t see it or try to disagree believe it or not. It’s inevitable. I knew it was inevitable in 2013 when I first heard about Bitcoin. A cryptocurrency will replace fiat currency in the future. Will it be Bitcoin? ETH? Dogecoin? Some other cryptocurrency that doesn’t exist yet? I don’t know. What I do know is that the only cryptocurrency that has inflationary tendencies that line up with traditional fiat currency very very well, allowing for an ease in the transition, a community dedicated to its success regardless of the cost, a mascot that allows for ease for spread of information to the masses thereby assisting with mass adoption is Dogecoin.

Thank you for reading this post in its entirety. It took a large amount of collective effort of people in my discord. I appreciate them to no end. We have over 100 people in that discord and we are here to stay. We are interested in explaining Dogecoin, reducing the scare factor and backing up Dogecoin through economic, social, financial, mathematical theory, etc. Per R/Dogecoin rules I cannot give out this discord, but if you are interested message me. It goes into greater detail on every one of these topics,  with resources, links, articles etc. thank you and above all else remember that at the end of the day this is a meme cryptocurrency from 2013.

"We all know ETH fees are high. Here's why it's happening, how to save money, and what is being done about it going forward.","Full disclaimer: I own some ETH. I've seen a lot of posts here and in /r/ethereum talking about high fees. I've also seen a lot of extremely misleading statements here and there about how high fees are right now and will try and simplify things a bit. I'll do my best to remain impartial, and feel free to correct me and I'll edit my post. All plans are subject to change, the following is based on my current understanding and recollection of developer statements.

>What is happening?

* ETH fees are high right now. The best place to see gas costs (how much you'll need to pay for a transaction vs how quickly you want it) is here: https://ethgasstation.info/

* Smart contracts and ERC-20 tokens consume much more gas than a basic transfer. While a typical transfer might be $3 a poorly written smart contract could consume $100 in gas. This variation leads to lots of confusion on various forums. An absolute metric crap ton of tokens run on ETH, so ETH being congested causes lots of downstream effects, tokens that consume lots of gas are disproportionately effected.

>Why is this happening?

 * [Utilization is through the roof right now](https://txstreet.com/v/eth-btc). At post time ETH is achieving 16.14 TPS vs BTC's 4.00. Despite being 4 times faster the demand for on-chain (L1) transactions is overwhelming. At the bottom of [this page, make sure to scroll down](https://ethgasstation.info/index.php) you can see that blocks are at 100% right now. That means people are constantly outbidding each other to make it in.

 * At post time [Uniswap](https://ethgasstation.info/gasguzzlers.php) is the biggest gas guzzler. People are using Decentralized Exchanges (dex'es) a ton and its consuming a huge chunk of block space and people are paying a premium for it.

>How can I save money?

 * ETH demand fluctuates heavily throughout the day, it's not uncommon for fees to drop 10x in an hour. If you are not in a hurry waiting a bit for a slow period and broadcasting a median gas transaction can save you a TON of money

 * Some wallets/apps are designed to be super user friendly, and unfortunately they hardcode the fastest possible gas costs for a good user experience (UX). Unfortunately that's a very bad idea when gas is high and only causes rates to climb even more. EIP-1559 will fix this, more on that later

 * Don't interact with smart contracts if you don't have to. It sucks, I know. But the fact is that using a smart contract is way more expensive than normal transactions. When gas is a fraction of a penny nobody cares, but its not right now and this is where we are. Last I checked, L1 [ETH](https://ycharts.com/indicators/ethereum_average_transaction_fee) transfers are still cheaper than [BTC](https://ycharts.com/indicators/bitcoin_average_transaction_fee). Not much of a consolation, but it's not a *total* disaster yet. EDIT: It appears the last 2 days ETH has flipped BTC on transaction costs. $17 USD still seems really really high, as of post-time a $5 transaction would go through within a few minutes)

>What is being done about this? (sorted by est delivery date)

 * Berlin upgrade: Est 1-2 months, will adjust gas costs of various transactions for certain core operations. Should help fees overall on many contracts.

 * EIP-1559: Est ""this summer, but maybe Q3"": A huge overhaul to the fee system. Block sizes are FLEXIBLE, targeting 50% full. When a block exceeds 50% full the base fee increases. When it drops below 50% the base fee decreases. Fees are burned (nice deflationary side effect). This means a few things: A) Spikes in transactions can make the next block instead of clogging the mem pool B) costs are MUCH more easy to calculate, and block include time estimation is much easier. C) The improved predictability/include time means shitty apps won't have a reason to set absurd fees for a good UX, driving ""gas inflation"" like we see now. There's a lot more to EIP-1559, but that's the gist of how it should impact transactions

 * 2.0 Phase 0: Already live, but the beacon chain won't impact 1.0 until ""the merge"". Baseline TPS should be higher than 1.0, and its also environmentally friendly :)

 * 2.0 Phase 1: Est end of 2021, Sharding will first scale to 64 shards (eventually 1024) for a 64x scaling effect on the beacon chain. 

 * The Merge: Some call this Phase 1.5, but it is planned for 2022. This will move ETH 1.0 as a shard on to 2.0, and all finality will occur on the beacon chain. At this point ETH's core TPS should be 64-100x faster than what we have today

 * 2.0 Phase 2: Est end of 2022/2023, Execution Environments aka sharded smart contracts allow for smart contracts to share data across shards so that DeFi/Dex'es etc benefit from 2.0's massive scalability

>What other out-of-order improvements are coming?

 * Various L2 technologies are already live, and several smart contracts are upgrading to them now. This will let you pay on L1 to ""get in"", then perform a lot of cheap transactions on L2. Right now every trade on uniswap clogs L1. When it runs on L2 all those trades are off-chain and gas fees are only driven up by deposits/withdrawals. This should have a massive impact on overall gas costs. The good news is the insane fees on some contracts act as an INCENTIVE to get L2 up and running faster.

I know a lot of people are unhappy with the current situation, but a lot of progress has been made and a lot of exciting progress is on the horizon! I hope this post helps :)",4739.0,2021-02-04 22:47:15,0.97
Putting your ETH stack to work,"A lot of people have been asking about ways to earn interest on their stack lately.  I wanted to make an all-in-one post that I could refer people to.

    ------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Centralized Lending:

**Examples:**    
BlockFi, Nexo

**ELI5 What it is:**    
You put money into BlockFi.  BlockFi uses this money to lend to others, primarily institutions.  BlockFi gives you some of the interest from that loan.  The user experience is much like using a centralized exchange.

**""Difficulty"" Level to Set up:**    
Easy

**Approximate ROI:**    
6% annual ROI on most assets

**Risk Level:**    
Medium

**Risks:**

* These are centralized, custodial services.  You are trusting them to hold onto your crypto and keep it safe.  There is no insurance and it's probably even less safe than leaving your crypto on most exchanges.  ""Not your keys, not your crypto.""

&#x200B;

    ------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Decentralized Lending:

**Examples:**    
Compound, Aave

**ELI5 What it is:**    
You put money into Compound.  Compound uses this money to lend to others.  Compound gives you some of the interest from that loan.  These are DeFi applications, meaning you would need to interact with smart contracts via a UI and an Ethereum wallet like Metamask.

**""Difficulty"" Level to Set up:**    
Moderate

**Approximate ROI:**    
1% annual ROI on ETH, 9% on stablecoins

**Risk Level:**    
Low-Medium

**Risks:**

* Smart contract risk - if a bug were ever found in the smart contract, it would likely have major effects for all users.  The major players are pretty battle tested at this point, however.

&#x200B;

    ------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Providing Liquidity (Yield Farming):

**Examples:**    
Uniswap, Sushiswap

**ELI5 What it is:**    
You put a pair of assets into Uniswap (let's say ETH and USDT).  This money is used to let traders swap between those two assets on the Uniswap platform.  So, as people make trades on Uniswap, the 0.3% trading fee is distributed across everyone that provided assets.  The more people trade, the more trading fees you acquire.

**""Difficulty"" Level to Set up:**    
Moderate

**Approximate ROI:**    
Extremely variable.  Can cause losses.  Can be moderate (10%) returns.  Can be monstrous (50%+) returns.

Think of it like you're selling shovels in a gold rush.

* The more people gold rushing, the more shovels you sell.    
(As trading volume goes up, that means more fees for you)
* The more people selling shovels, the less shovels you sell due to competition.    
(The more liquidity providers there are, the more people the trading fees are distributed across)
* If you pick the best place to sell shovels, you'll sell even more shovels.    
(Each liquidity pool is different.  If you pick a hot pair of assets, there will be lots of trading volume.)

**Risk Level:**    
Medium-High

**Risks:**

* Smart contract risk - if a bug were ever found in the smart contract, it would likely have major effects for all users.  The major players are pretty battle tested at this point, however.
* Impermanent loss.  These pools keep your assets in a 50/50 balance as prices fluctuate.  If one of your assets craters, you will end up with lots of that asset and much less of the other.  Providing liquidity on ETH and a small cap token can be extra risky (but also, potentially extra profitable).

# ETH 2.0 Staking:

**Examples:**

* Can be done on your own with various clients
* Can be done through exchanges like Kraken and Binance
* Can be done through decentralized protocols like Rocketpool

**ELI5 What it is:**    
The Ethereum network will soon be secured by people locking up ETH rather than running mining computers.  For those that have 32 ETH, they can run ETH 2.0 validators using their own computer.   For those that have less than 32 ETH (or don't want to go to the trouble of running it themselves), they can use staking services that pool together ETH from multiple people.  This staked ETH is used to run and secure the ETH 2.0 chain, which had a phase 0 launch in December 2020.  It runs in parallel to the current ETH 1.0 chain for now, and the two will eventually merge.

**""Difficulty"" Level to Set up:**

* Easy for custodial services
* Moderate difficulty for decentralized options
* Relatively high difficult to run it on your own

**Approximate ROI:**    
9% on ETH, but will likely decrease over time.  Some staking services also take a cut for themselves.

**Risk Level:**    
Medium

**Risks:**

* Technical upgrade risk.  This is a major migration involving new software.  There's no guarantee it will all go 100% perfectly.
* Lock-up phase.  Once your ETH is in, you're locked into holding until ETH 2.0 receives more functionality upgrades.  Some custodial services offer ways to escape this lock-up phase early, so always look into the full details.
* Slashing.  Validators that aren't available or are found to be misbehaving can be slashed, resulting in some of their staked ETH being burnt.",62.0,2021-02-03 19:00:46,0.97
How secure really is bitcoin compared to Ethereum from an economic perspective? Let’s put some numbers behind it.,"Let’s start with bitcoin. Miners secure the bitcoin network in exchange for revenue, which is the sum of block reward and transaction fees. At current run rate, miner annual revenue comes from about $6B of block reward and about $0.4B of transaction fees (source: https://bitinfocharts.com/bitcoin/). Let’s say miners use 75% (I think it’s a reasonable assumption, but happy to adjust that assumption) of that revenue to pay for electricity, overhead and maintenance costs, which leaves 25% of that revenue, or $1.6B annually, as marginal profit. Thanks to Moore’s law that chips (ASIC chips are no special, and they are no longer trade secret) for the same cost double computing power roughly every 2 years, I think large scale miners need to recoup the cost of their mining chips in 2 years (again, I think this is a reasonable assumption, but am happy to adjust if this is too controversial). That gives us a total of $3.2B of replacement cost for today’s total bitcoin mining enterprises. This may sound like a lot, but it’s $3.2B of capital deployed to secure a bitcoin market cap of $355B today, which is a Capital Security Ratio of 0.91% (0.85% of which subsidized from block reward, and 0.06% from transaction fees). This ratio is critically important, since if it’s too low (some may argue it’s already too low), it becomes trivial for a well funded vehicle (like a DAO, not to mention a nation state actor) investing in enough mining power to attack the network while profiting from off-chain short positions. 
The Capital Security Ratio for bitcoin will most likely continue to drop due to halvening of block reward and its inability to grow transaction fees (WBTC or other types of representation on Ethereum definitely adds more downward pressure on bitcoin transaction fee revenue).

Now, let’s look at Ethereum as it is today. Ethereum miner annual revenue is $3.8B (about $2.8B from block rewards, and $1B from transaction fees) (source: https://bitinfocharts.com/ethereum/). Following the same logic as bitcoin mining, this gives us a 2.88% of Capital Security Ratio for Ethereum. 

Lastly, let’s look at Ethereum post EIP-1559 and “the merge” (end of POW mining). As my previous post (https://www.reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/k9dsk6/for_those_who_are_tormented_by_eths_short_term/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf)  hinted, at steady state, annual transaction fee burned equals annual issuance, therefore, total capital at stake is a function of total transaction fee and investor return hurdle rate. Assuming 5% is a decent rate (as we all see people continue to make deposits to become validators on beacon chain even knowing funds are being locked up for the next 18-24 months, some may argue this hurdle might be even lower), that $1B transaction fees will attract a whopping $20B in capital to secure the network! It’s a Capital Security Ratio of 30% with today’s ether market cap! Or about 10% at steady state when ether market cap rises up to meet the condition of fee burned rate equals issuance rate.

A lot of narratives these days are being repeated in public as if they were foregone conclusions). They don’t necessarily stand under closer examination - bitcoin store of value or gold 2.0 narrative fall in this category. The 21M hard cap doesn’t make it a store of value if network can be brought down and your balance can be wiped out by rational profit seeking actors. 

TLDR: Ethereum today is already more secure than bitcoin on a relative basis. And Ethereum after “the merge” will be 10 to 50 times more secure than bitcoin.",127.0,2020-12-14 21:41:34,0.98
"For those who are tormented by eth’s short term price movements, or wonder how much ETH is worth and when to exit your ETH position, here are a few numbers to put that in perspective. (Tldr: anything below $2,000 right now is considered a fire sale!)","Let’s first lay out 2 very plausible assumptions:
1. EIP 1559 and Eth1-Eth2 merge happen in the next 24 months 
2. Current fee revenue is trending close to $1B a year, and continues to grow (fee per transaction may be reduced with scaling solutions, but total fee revenue should continue to grow in the long run and block space continue to be valuable).

Now, let’s say 5% is a respectable annual return for eth stakers, which translates to about 10m eth at stake and 0.5% annual eth issuance rate. 
Since $1B annual fee burnt by EIP1559, in order to offset the above 0.5% annual issuance and keep total eth supply constant, eth total market cap will need to be $200B (if it was lower than that, we would have negative inflation which would drive price up). 

But we don’t just end there! With institutional and long term investors getting onboard and better understanding of Ethereum and eth’s value propositions, they are not going to price eth with today’s fee burnt. Instead, they will expect exponential fee revenue growth due to increasing adoption, so they will price eth as if $5B or even $10B annual fees getting burnt at a steady state. That translates into $1-2T valuation easily, simply with EIP1559 and the “merge” being fulfilled.",180.0,2020-12-08 21:45:07,0.94
A plain english explanation on what to expect from Ethereum 2.0,"Seven years after Vitalik Buterin published the Ethereum whitepaper in 2013, Ethereum has evolved into a thriving financial ecosystem. In 2020, the network is on pace to settle nearly $1 trillion in annual transactions for the first time, and currently supports over $100B in assets and tens of thousands of applications.

Despite Ethereum’s undeniable success, its aspirations are loftier still. It aims to secure a significant base of the global economy, all while remaining globally accessible to individual users at its base layer. Achieving this under Ethereum’s current throughput of 15 transactions per second is simply not feasible.

Ethereum 2.0 is a major network upgrade, years in the making, that if successful will scale Ethereum’s throughput by more than 1,000x, without sacrificing decentralization. It will also transform the network’s native asset, ETH, by bestowing it with new properties while bringing its long term inflation rate down below 1%.

With the numerous layer-1 competitors eying Ethereum’s market share and the recent surge in DeFi activity pushing Ethereum to its limits, the stakes could not be higher.

The first major phase of ETH 2.0 will kick into high gear tomorrow at 12pm UTC (7am EST) with the launch of Phase 0 and the Beacon Chain.

**Phase 0**

Ethereum 2.0 essentially boils down to creating a new blockchain from scratch with a new consensus mechanism (proof of stake) and new architecture (sharding) before porting all of Ethereum’s existing applications to the new chain without disruption.

The **Beacon Chain** is Ethereum 2.0’s proof of stake blockchain. Where Ethereum is currently secured via Proof of Work miners, the Beacon Chain will be secured through Proof of Stake **validators.** Where proof of work involves running specialized hardware that consume vast quantities of electricity, proof of stake requires downloading some software and committing a stake of 32 ETH to a smart contract.

While the launch of the Beacon Chain will capture much of the excitement in the near future, outside of bootstrapping a network of proof of stake validators, this chain will have little functionality. Sharding and smart contract support will not be introduced until later phases.

Before Ethereum can port existing applications over to Ethereum 2.0, it’s next phase will need to launch which won’t occur until a year from now at the earliest.

**Phase 1**

Once Phase 0 has been completed and ETH 2.0’s validator set is firmly in place, **Phase 1** will implement new architecture for how the Beachon Chain stores data, called sharding.

Currently, Ethereum full nodes must store a full history of every transaction that’s ever occurred and process every new transaction on the network. This makes running a full node onerous and is a primary source of Ethereum’s scaling woes.

Sharding will subdivide Ethereum’s Beacon Chain into 64 pieces, or “shards”. Where nodes currently store data for the entire blockchain, each shard will have its own subset of nodes processing it. Sharding alone will scale Ethereum’s throughput by 64x.

Even when sharding is implemented (possibly around this time next year), the entire Ethereum ecosystem will continue to run in parallel on the proof of work chain.

**Phase 1.5 - “The merge”**

Once Ethereum’s Beacon Chain has a full set of PoS validators securing the network, and the chain has been subdivided into 64 parallel shards, then it will be time to merge Ethereum as we know it today into Ethereum 2.0.

This will be accomplished by merging all of the smart contracts and transaction data from the PoW chain into a shard under the PoS chain. At this point, Ethereum will have successfully transitioned from proof of work to proof of stake.

However, this will not take place until some time until 2022, so the earliest point in which the average Ethereum user today interacts with Ethereum 2.0 is at least one year away.

**Phase 2 (that may never happen)**

When the merge between Eth1 & Eth2 takes place, all of the smart contracting execution will take place within a single shard on Eth2.

The final phase of Ethereum 2.0, Phase 2, involves unlocking smart contract execution across some or all the Beacon Chain’s 64 shards. Additionally, phase 2 may introduce a new virtual machine.

However, this phase may end up being unnecessary with phases 0-1.5 and the adoption of a layer-2 scaling technique called “rollups.” Rollups are a type of layer 2 scaling technology that process transactions independently of the Ethereum blockchain, but settle snapshots of their state to the main chain.

**Rollups + “Phase 1.5” would amount to a \~10,000x+ improvement in network processing capacity over the current state of Ethereum.** This means that if current layer-one protocols embrace rollups, Eth2 as it’s currently laid out may never fully launch, but Ethereum will reach its desired scalability within the next two years.

"Bitcoin Dash, or How (not) to Merge Blockchains?","Since there was a recent [Tao & Amanda video](https://www.reddit.com/r/dashpay/comments/eijhf7/dash_evonet_released_happy_2020_tao_amanda_live/) about merging DASH and Bitcoin Cash (BCH), and many still seem to be [into it](https://www.reddit.com/r/dashpay/comments/eitpu8/boom_bust_cryptocurrency_special_dash_briefly/), I would like to clarify why I don't think it's a good idea. It has nothing to do with looking weak, being fearful, or selling out, but technical problems with the way blockchains work (it's really hard to kill a chain). This is all IMO, and I'd be happy for anyone to disagree/agree.

---

It was a nice marketing idea to attract attention to DASH's superior technology, and got a lot of people talking, but in reality, **merging blockchains can't work**. It won't result in more unity, but more divisions instead. 

I believe that **the only way a chain merge could happen is if a newly forked project is created that ""respects"" all UTXOs from both DASH and BCH** (at some ""arbitrary"" fixed exchange rate). Then, just as Ethereum forked to create both ETH and ETC, and Bitcoin forked to create both BTC and BCH... then both DASH and BCH ""merging"" (forking) would result in THREE (3) existing chains: BCH, DASH, and BC-ASH (or whatever ticker is chosen). Many believed ETC and BCH would just die off, but they have not. It's unlikely that a merge-fork could kill off the old DASH/BCH chains, either.

It is *not* similar to a *stock merger*, because the stock certificates you own are all transferred to the merged company's stock. In contrast, a blockchain project can continue to exist and trade on exchanges after a fork/merge, as long as *anyone in the world* continues to run the original software. **Two blockchains merging is not really a merge - it's more like a fork to a third chain** (which ""respects"" the UTXOs of both merging blockchains, by allowing anyone that has a UTXO on either chain to spend to a transaction on the ""newly merged"" chain).

But *suppose* somehow all of DASH agrees to merge, creating just two chains: original BCH and the newly ""merged"" DASH (aka BC-ASH). This would still be pretty bad. Even in the unlikely case that all DASH users agreed (by vote of MNOs and software update/enforcement) - i.e. allowing BCH's UTXOs to be spent on DASH's new ""merged chain"" - it's quite likely that many **BCH holders would not want it, and would just sell** the newly merged coins on the open market, depressing the price of the new chain. Just as BTC hodlers sold their BCH post-fork to get more BTC, the BCH holders would probably sell their ""free DASH"" to get more BCH. Furthermore, it's not necessary for DASH to fork to ""allow BCH spends"" (aka ""merge"") - anyone with BCH that wants DASH can *already* buy, mine, or earn it, *today*!

(It's not really possible for the ""merge"" to create just one chain, because BCH *cannot* all ""agree"" to merge - lack of governance that resulted in BTC-BCH-BSV-etc ensures that)

**TLDR;**

(1) A ""merge"" would most likely create 3 communities, and each of the resultant *three* communities would probably be smaller than each of the *two* previous communities, **resulting in more divisions rather than unity.** 

(2) A ""merge"" could less likely create only 2 communities, but BCH-ers would just sell their ""newly acquired"" merged coin, **depressing the price instead of growing the community.** 

(3) A ""merge"" cannot create one community, because **BCH lacks the governance.**",20.0,2020-01-04 09:15:50,0.92
Vitalik: Alternative proposal for early eth1 <-> eth2 merge,"I found this on the /r/ethereum sub. 

i know i post a lot about ethereum, its not to shill. I find this the most interesting blockchains projects. 

As you may / maynot be aware along with the changes in eth 2.0; one of the more contentious / ""risky"" aspects is moving from PoW to PoS. at the time of reading on how it would be done a year or so ago. there would be a slow migration where out of 99 blocks mined by PoW, 1 would be mined by PoS and the migration would transition like this over time i.e. migration from of block roducers from PoW to PoS. 

There is also diminishing returns for staying on PoW with a difficulty bomb to finialise the move to PoS, some info on that here if you dont know, it rose some questions.

https://www.investopedia.com/news/what-ethereums-difficulty-bomb/

The changes in this article talk about a simplier migration, eth1 will remain on its own shard in the new eth lets call it eth 1.5. there are a few advantages of this explained in the article compared to how they were to migrate previously. essentially it makes it easier, less risky.

this would allow PoS could come to eth sooner with all the other changes in eth 2.0.

A 300 Word Description about 2key Network - The Smart Link Inventors,"A Still-Impressive TL;DR: 2key in 300 Words

HTTP links are a fundamental part of the web: they enable us to navigate through the web. In the scramble to decentralize the internet, the creation of Smart Links, which merge smart contracts into HTTP links, are the most effective means of pulling the masses towards a better, decentralized, and democratized web.

2key Network has created the most advanced layer two solution for the Ethereum network. Any application built atop this layer benefits from the highly decentralized and robust security of Ethereum, while having the scalability benefits derived from 2key’s development. The first application built upon this layer is 2key’s *Smart Link*.

Unlike a standard HTML link, which at best allows tracking of click data, the Smart Link is able to track every person that has come in contact with a link, while simultaneously associating a wallet with that person; this wallet can be unlocked through any browser, offline, thereby ensuring the security of the wallet’s accrued assets. The purpose of the auto-creation of wallets is to ensure anyone who was involved in the chain of shares that eventually led to a customer-acquisition — a product sale, a content read, an investment, etc. — is rewarded for the role played in that conversion.

&#x200B;

The rewards are sourced from contract creators who opt to attract a customer base through the most advanced digitalization of word of mouth: Smart Link sharing. Contract creators have the ability to set the terms which the HTML link-bound smart contracts should recognize as a conversion. Once the terms are met, the smart contract automatically distributes, among all who shared the link, the conversion payment the contract creator had set.

2key Network democratizes the value distribution of the digital ad sector by allowing people to decentralize the web by simply sharing the same links they interact with every day.

How about a Hackathon?,"Hey guys,

I’m really impressed with all the recent developtments going on (Merge mining, DPoS, sidechains). I feel it’s about time to show our progress to the world and attrack some new dev’s while we’re at it.

How do you guys feel about organising a good old Hackathon? As we’re deploying both Neo and Ethereum sidechains, wouldn’t it be great to organise a Hackathon where Neo and Ethereum teams battle against eachother, utilitising their own chain?

I think this would be a perfect showcase of the capabilities of our tech, introducing experienced dev’s to Elastos. Furthermore, they could experience what Elastos could mean for the tech their currently working on by testing their code on a testnet of our sidechain, possibly winning some hearts over.

I’ve got no experience organising a Hackathon, but am willing to help out on the practical side of things (i am based in Amsterdam). 

What do you guys think about this idea? 

Anybody in the community who has experience with Hackathon’s? 

Any good ideas for the content of the Hackathon?

How should we promote the initiative?

Is it something we should propose to the CR, or should we take this initiative in our own hands?

Should we ask Jimmy for input?

Open for all suggestions and/or criticism. I’m just putting the idea out there (it might be a stupid idea for all i know, i’m not that experienced in the tech-world)

Take good care,

Faireum learns from the best and improves on the best. The team behind Faireum has developed an entirely new and competitive independent blockchain based on the strengths of Bitcoin, Ethereum and Hyperledger. Alongside this is Faireum’s consensus algorithm which is adopted from the Byzantine fault tolerance-based delegated proof-of-stake (BFT-DPos). An attack on the consensus is virtually impractical and impossible, as proven by Faireum’s role models.

Furthermore, the Faireum Virtual Machine (FVM) allows users and investors alike to create smart contracts that are interconnected with a wide array of blockchain-based coins, as well as freely exchange assets at any time, in any place.

 Fairness at its purest – the Zero Random Algorithm

Obviously, random number generators (RNGs) are essential for games of chance. However, the problem is that there are no standard methods of creating an RNG that is closest to being truly random. This results in a **flawed game logic** that centralized online betting platforms implement. No one knows how these programs work and people are losing money without them knowing.

The Zero Random Algorithm is Faireum’s answer to these questionable RNGs being implemented in gambling platforms. By having a blockchain-based internal RNG that is validated by Zero-Knowledge proof, each random number generated from the blockchain is verified to be truly random, or **provably fair**.

 Build your world, a faireum-powered world

Outside Faireum’s very own official platform, everyone else can get their hands on Faireum’s innovation. With Faireum’s application program interface (API) and software development kit (SDK), game developers and platform proprietors can also easily adapt and integrate Faireum into their games and systems and tailor them according to their preference.

Faireum sees a service-based **value-for-value** blockchain ecosystem. This eliminates the chance-altering systems of gambling platforms that exist solely for profit. In this way, players get what players give**, A fair chance for everyone**.

A winter-proof crypto economy

With Institutional Investors such as University endowments like Harvard and MIT now investing in cryptocurrency funds, a more transformed business model awaits the crypto-economy wherein various economies of countless fields merge into one stronghold that is insusceptible to mere crypto climate conditions alone. Faireum brings this transformation to the investors—a soil to plant their seeds on—to show them that their seeds aren’t dead, after all.",20.0,2019-03-29 17:38:29,0.96

Mastering Ethereum has completed copy-edits and is heading to the printers (and e-printers) by December,"Mastering Ethereum just completed the copy-edit process. It's in final production and heading to distribution by the end of November. Pre-order copies will start shipping from Amazon around the end of November, new orders by Dec 10th.

The book is twice as long as originally planned (400+ pages from 200). It has some gaps, due to the constant changing nature and sprawling breadth of Ethereum as a topic, but we'll have to address those in a second edition. Overall, I'm very happy with the result and I hope it serves to help thousands of developers get started and learn how to ""Master"" Ethereum.

What is happening right now – and what it means for the future,"I have seen a lot of despair recently. I don’t think we’ve reached capitulation just yet, but we will soon. And I am not here to offer unnecessary hopium. What I am here to do is provide an objective assessment of the current cryptocurrency ecosystem and why I think there is light at the end of the tunnel. And oh, what light…

&#x200B;

What we currently have is a rapidly developing infrastructure for institutions and investors:

&#x200B;

\- BAKKT, custody solutions, crypto insurance solutions: no later than the end of this year the global masses will be able to purchase crypto with the click of a button on their brokerage accounts. No worries about storing or losing it, as it will be held by a 3rd party, and insured. Now say what you will about people not really owning their crypto this way, the fact is I have spoken to numerous middle aged would-be investors who have told me that they’d invest in crypto if it was easier and safer. Well, BAKKT makes it much easier and much safer. We are about to see the markets opened up to a vast swathe of investors who previously feared to tread in these waters. This will create a feedback effect as the space is increasingly legitimized in the eyes of the old-style investors who previously did not see this space as trustworthy.

&#x200B;

\- Gemini Ethereum based stablecoin: the “GUSD” is another significant milestone in opening up the world of cryptocurrencies to an entire new population of institutions and investors. FUD has dogged USDT since its inception, but now we have a coin that is not only effectively government approved, it’s also headed by a team that is fiercely respected and well-known in the markets. This will provide a new fully legitimized way to hop into and out of cryptos, and finally replace USDT as the lifeblood of the ecosystem. USDT will fade into obscurity and with it so will the FUD that has plagued our system for so long.

&#x200B;

In short: What this means is that the market will be opened up to a significant number of new investors and institutions. Most importantly, the space is being legitimized and we will soon see a melding of the old world of investing with the new digital one, as old systems migrate onto and merge into the digital / blockchain space.

&#x200B;

This does not mean we will see a market-wide resurgence across all coins. What we’ve witnessed recently is a necessary purge of unnecessary altcoins and scam projects that belong in the gutter. The real projects with real use cases will rise from the sea of dreck and will be ones that are accepted into the custody and insurance infrastructure, cementing themselves as legitimate in the eyes of institutions and investors, and with it we will likely see the beginnings of a run that is this time based on fundamentals and real-world use cases.

&#x200B;

My advice is to avoid the dreck and start to ladder in to the era-defining projects of tomorrow: BTC, ETH, XMR… and whatever other projects that your own research suggests are likely to survive this purge. Don’t get shaken out. The blood may flow even into 2019 but it’s close to ending.

**Different Platforms for dApps and Smart-Contracts**

While Ethereum is the most mature dApp framework with both the best developer tools, resources and community, there are other public blockchain platforms. Third generation blockchains are trying to solve Ethereum’s scaling and performance issues. Here is an overview of dApp platforms that can be worth looking into:

**NEO** \- [https://neo.org/](https://neo.org/)  
 The second most mature dApp platform. NEO has better scalability and performance than Ethereum and has 1’000 TPS to ETH’s 15 by utilizing a dBFT consensus algorithm. While better infrastructure, NEO does not have the maturity of Ethereum’s developer tools, documentation and community.

A writeup on why a company chose to develop on NEO and not Ethereum: [https://medium.com/orbismesh/why-we-chose-neo-over-ethereum-37fc9208ffa0](https://medium.com/orbismesh/why-we-chose-neo-over-ethereum-37fc9208ffa0)

**Cardano** \- [https://www.cardano.org/en/home/](https://www.cardano.org/en/home/)  
 While still in alpha with a long and ambitious roadmap ahead of it, Cardano is one of the most anticipated dApp platforms out there. IOHK, the research and engineering company that maintains Cardano, has listed a lot of great resources and scientific papers that is worth looking into.

An Intro to Cardano: [https://hackernoon.com/cardano-ethereum-and-neo-killer-or-overhyped-and-overpriced-8fcd5f8abcdf](https://hackernoon.com/cardano-ethereum-and-neo-killer-or-overhyped-and-overpriced-8fcd5f8abcdf)

IOHK Scientific Papers - [https://iohk.io/research/papers/](https://iohk.io/research/papers/)

**Stellar** \- [https://www.stellar.org/](https://www.stellar.org/)  
 If moving value fast from one party to another by using smart-contracts is the goal, Stellar Lumens is your platform. Initially as an open-source fork from Ripple, Stellar has become one of the mature frameworks for financial applications. Stellar’s focus lies in interoperability with legacy financial systems and cheap/fast value transfer. It’s smart-contract capability is rather limited in comparison to Ethereum and HyperLedger, so take that in consideration.

**Ripple** – www.ripple.com  
 Ripple and its close cousin, Stellar, is two of the most well-known cryptocurrencies and DLT frameworks meant for the financial sector. Ripple enables instant settlement between banks for international transactions.

# Consensus Algorithms

**\[Proof of Work\]** \- very short, cuz it's well-known.

\[1\] Bitcoin - to generate a new block miner must generate hash of the new block header that is in line with given requirements.

Others: Ethereum, Litecoin etc.

**\[Hybrid of PoW and PoS\]**

\[2\] Decred - hybrid of “proof of work” and “proof of stake”. Blocks are created about every 5 minutes. Nodes in the network looking for a solution with a known difficulty to create a block (PoW). Once the solution is found it is broadcast to the network. The network then verifies the solution. Stakeholders who have locked some DCR in return for a ticket\* now have the chance to vote on the block (PoS). 5 tickets are chosen pseudo-randomly from the ticket pool and if at least 3 of 5 vote ‘yes’ the block is permanently added to the blockchain. Both miners and voters are compensated with DCR : PoS - 30% and PoW - 60% of about 30 new Decred issued with a block. \* 1 ticket = ability to cast 1 vote. Stakeholders must wait an average of 28 days (8,192 blocks) to vote their tickets.

**\[Proof of Stake\]**

\[3\] Nxt - The more tokens are held by account, the greater chance that account will earn the right to generate a block. The total reward received as a result of block generation is the sum of the transaction fees located within the block. Three values are key to determining which account is eligible to generate a block, which account earns the right to generate a block, and which block is taken to be the authoritative one in times of conflict: base target value, target value and cumulative difficulty. Each block on the chain has a generation signature parameter. To participate in the block's forging process, an active account digitally signs the generation signature of the previous block with its own public key. This creates a 64-byte signature, which is then hashed using SHA256. The first 8 bytes of the resulting hash are converted to a number, referred to as the account hit. The hit is compared to the current target value(active balance). If the computed hit is lower than the target, then the next block can be generated.

**\[4\] Peercoin (chain-based proof of stake)** \- coin age parameter. Hybrid PoW and PoS algorithm. The longer your Peercoins have been stationary in your account (to a maximum of 90 days), the more power (coin age) they have to mint a block. The act of minting a block requires the consumption of coin age value, and the network determines consensus by selecting the chain with the largest total consumed coin age. Reward - minting + 1% yearly.

**\[5\] Reddcoin (Proof of stake Velocity)** \- quite similar to Peercoin, difference: not linear coin-aging function (new coins gain weight quickly, and old coins gain weight increasingly slowly) to encourage Nodes Activity. Node with most coin age weight have a bigger chance to create block. To create block Node should calculate right hash. Block reward - interest on the weighted age of coins/ 5% annual interest in PoSV phase.

**\[6\] Ethereum (Casper) - uses modified BFT consensus**. Blocks will be created using PoW. In the Casper Phase 1 implementation for Ethereum, the “proposal mechanism"" is the existing proof of work chain, modified to have a greatly reduced block reward. Blocks will be validated by set of Validators. Block is finalised when 2/3 of validators voted for it (not the number of validators is counted, but their deposit size). Block creator rewarded with Block Reward + Transaction FEES.

**\[7\] Lisk (Delegated Proof-of-stake)** \- Lisk stakeholders vote with vote transaction (the weight of the vote depends on the amount of Lisk the stakeholder possess) and choose 101 Delegates, who create all blocks in the blockchain. One delegate creates 1 block within 1 round (1 round contains 101 blocks) -> At the beginning of each round, each delegate is assigned a slot indicating their position in the block generation process -> Delegate includes up to 25 transactions into the block, signs it and broadcasts it to the network -> As >51% of available peers agreed that this block is acceptable to be created (Broadhash consensus), a new block is added to the blockchain. \*Any account may become a delegate, but only accounts with the required stake (no info how much) are allowed to generate blocks. Block reward - minted Lisks and transaction fees (fees for all 101 blocks are collected firstly and then are divided between delegates). Blocks appears every 10 sec.

**\[8\] Cardano (Ouroboros Proof of Stake)** \- Blocks(slots) are created by Slot Leaders. Slot Leaders for N Epoch are chosen during n-1 Epoch. Slot Leaders are elected from the group of ADA stakeholders who have enough stake. Election process consist of 3 phases: Commitment phase: each elector generates a random value (secret), signs it and commit as message to network (other electors) saved in to block. -> Reveal phase: Each elector sends special value to open a commitment, all this values (opening) are put into the block. -> Recovery phase: each elector verifies that commitments and openings match and extracts the secrets and forms a SEED (randomly generated bytes string based on secrets). All electors get the same SEED. -> Follow the Satoshi algorithm : Elector who have coin which corresponded to SEED become a SLOT LEADER and get a right to create a block. Slot Leader is rewarded with minted ADA and transactions Fee.

**\[9\] Tezos (Proof Of Stake)** \- generic and self-amending crypto-ledger. At the beginning of each cycle (2048 blocks), a random seed is derived from numbers that block miners chose and committed to in the penultimate cycle, and revealed in the last. -> Using this random seed, a follow the coin strategy (similar to Follow The Satoshi) is used to allocate mining rights and signing rights to stakeholders for the next cycle\*. -> Blocks are mined by a random stakeholder (the miner) and includes multiple signatures of the previous block provided by random stakeholders (the signers). Mining and signing both offer a small reward but also require making a one cycle safety deposit to be forfeited in the event of a double mining or double signing.

· the more coins (rolls) you have - the more your chance to be a miner/signer.

**\[10\] Tendermint (Byzantine Fault Tolerance**) - A proposal is signed and published by the designated proposer at each round. The proposer is chosen by a deterministic and non-choking round robin selection algorithm that selects proposers in proportion to their voting power. The proposer create the block, that should be validated by >2/3 of Validators, as follow: Propose -> Prevote -> Precommit -> Commit. Proposer rewarded with Transaction FEES.

**\[11\] Tron (Byzantine Fault Tolerance**) - This blockhain is still on development stage. Consensus algorithm = PoS + BFT (similar to Tendermint): PoS algorithm chooses a node as Proposer, this node has the power to generate a block. -> Proposer broadcasts a block that it want to release. -> Block enters the Prevote stage. It takes >2/3 of nodes' confirmations to enter the next stage. -> As the block is prevoted, it enters Precommit stage and needs >2/3 of node's confirmation to go further. -> As >2/3 of nodes have precommited the block it's commited to the blockchain with height +1. New blocks appears every 15 sec.

**\[12\] NEO (Delegated Byzantine Fault Tolerance)** \- Consensus nodes\* are elected by NEO holders -> The Speaker is identified (based on algorithm) -> He broadcasts proposal to create block -> Each Delegate (other consensus nodes) validates proposal -> Each Delegate sends response to other Delegates -> Delegate reaches consensus after receiving 2/3 positive responses -> Each Delegate signs the block and publishes it-> Each Delegate receives a full block. Block reward 6 GAS distributed proportionally in accordance with the NEO holding ratio among NEO holders. Speaker rewarded with transaction fees (mostly 0). \* Stake 1000 GAS to nominate yourself for Bookkeeping(Consensus Node)

**\[13\] EOS (Delegated Proof of Stake)** \- those who hold tokens on a blockchain adopting the EOS.IO software may select\* block producers through a continuous approval voting system and anyone may choose to participate in block production and will be given an opportunity to produce blocks proportional to the total votes they have received relative to all other producers. At the start of each round 21 unique block producers are chosen. The top 20 by total approval are automatically chosen every round and the last producer is chosen proportional to their number of votes relative to other producers. Block should be confirmed by 2/3 or more of elected Block producers. Block Producer rewarded with Block rewards. \*the more EOS tokens a stakeholder owns, the greater their voting power

**\[The XRP Ledger Consensus Process\]**

**\[14\] Ripple - Each node receives transaction from external applications** \-> Each Node forms public list of all valid (not included into last ledger (=block)) transactions aka (Candidate Set) -> Nodes merge its candidate set with UNLs(Unique Node List) candidate sets and vote on the veracity of all transactions (1st round of consensus) -> all transactions that received at least 50% votes are passed on the next round (many rounds may take place) -> final round of consensus requires that min 80% of Nodes UNL agreeing on transactions. It means that at least 80% of Validating nodes should have same Candidate SET of transactions -> after that each Validating node computes a new ledger (=block) with all transactions (with 80% UNL agreement) and calculate ledger hash, signs and broadcasts -> All Validating nodes compare their ledgers hash -> Nodes of the network recognize a ledger instance as validated when a 80% of the peers have signed and broadcast the same validation hash. -> Process repeats. Ledger creation process lasts 5 sec(?). Each transaction includes transaction fee (min 0,00001 XRP) which is destroyed. No block rewards.

**\[The Stellar consensus protocol\]**

**\[15\] Stellar (Federated Byzantine Agreement)** \- quite similar to Ripple. Key difference - quorum slice.

**\[Proof of Burn\]**

\[16\] Slimcoin - to get the right to write blocks Node should “burn” amount of coins. The more coins Node “burns” more chances it has to create blocks (for long period) -> Nodes address gets a score called Effective Burnt Coins that determines chance to find blocks. Block creator rewarded with block rewards.

**\[Proof of Importance\]**

\[17\] NEM - Only accounts that have min 10k vested coins are eligible to harvest (create a block). Accounts with higher importance scores have higher probabilities of harvesting a block. The higher amount of vested coins, the higher the account’s Importance score. And the higher amount of transactions that satisfy following conditions: - transactions sum min 1k coins, - transactions made within last 30 days, - recipient have 10k vested coins too, - the higher account’s Important score. Harvester is rewarded with fees for the transactions in the block. A new block is created approx. every 65 sec.

**\[Proof of Devotion\]**

\[18\] Nebulas (Proof of Devotion + BFT) - quite similar to POI, the PoD selects the accounts with high influence. All accounts are ranked according to their liquidity and propagation (Nebulas Rank) -> Top-ranked accounts are selected -> Chosen accounts pay deposit and are qualified as the blocks Validators\* -> Algorithm pseudo-randomly chooses block Proposer -> After a new block is proposed, Validators Set (each Validator is charged a deposit) participate in a round of BFT-Style voting to verify block (1. Prepare stage -> 2. Commit Stage. Validators should have > 2/3 of total deposits to validate Block) -> Block is added. Block rewards : each Validator rewarded with 1 NAS. \*Validators Set is dynamic, changes in Set may occur after Epoch change.

**\[IOTA Algorithm\]**

\[19\] IOTA - uses DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph) instead of blockchain (TANGLE equal to Ledger). Graph consist of transactions (not blocks). To issue a new transaction Node must approve 2 random other Transactions (not confirmed). Each transaction should be validate n(?) times. By validating PAST(2) transactions whole Network achieves Consensus. in Order to issue transaction Node: 1. Sign transaction with private key 2. choose two other Transactions to validate based on MCMC(Markov chain Monte Carlo) algorithm, check if 2 transactions are valid (node will never approve conflicting transactions) 3. make some PoW(similar to HashCash). -> New Transaction broadcasted to Network. Node don’t receive reward or fee.

**\[PBFT + PoW\]**

\[20\] Yobicash - uses PBFT and also PoW. Nodes reach consensus on transactions by querying other nodes. A node asks its peers about the state of a transaction: if it is known or not, and if it is a doublespending transaction or not. As follow : Node receives new transaction -> Checks if valid -> queries all known nodes for missing transactions (check if already in DAG ) -> queries 2/3 nodes for doublepsending and possibility -> if everything is ok add to DAG. Reward - nodes receive transaction fees + minting coins.

**\[Proof of Space/Proof of Capacity\]**

\[21\] Filecoin (Power Fault Tolerance) - the probability that the network elects a miner(Leader) to create a new block (it is referred to as the voting power of the miner) is proportional to storage currently in use in relation to the rest of the network. Each node has Power - storage in use verified with Proof of Spacetime by nodes. Leaders extend the chain by creating a block and propagating it to the network. There can be an empty block (when no leader). A block is committed if the majority of the participants add their weight on the chain where the block belongs to, by extending the chain or by signing blocks. Block creator rewarded with Block reward + transaction fees.

**\[Proof of Elapsed Time (POET)\]**

\[22\] Hyperledger Sawtooth - Goal - to solve BFT Validating Nodes limitation. Works only with intel’s SGX. PoET uses a random leader election model or a lottery based election model based on SGX, where the protocol randomly selects the next leader to finalize the block. Every validator requests a wait time from an enclave (a trusted function). -> The validator with the shortest wait time for a particular transaction block is elected the leader. -> The BlockPublisher is responsible for creating candidate blocks to extend the current chain. He takes direction from the consensus algorithm for when to create a block and when to publish a block. He creates, Finalizes, Signs Block and broadcast it -> Block Validators check block -> Block is created on top of blockchain.

**\[23\] Byteball (Delegated Byzantine Fault Tolerance)** \- only verified nodes are allowed to be Validation nodes (list of requirements [https://github.com/byteball/byteball-witness](https://github.com/byteball/byteball-witness)). Users choose in transaction set of 12 Validating nodes. Validating nodes(Witnesses) receive transaction fees.

**\[24\] Nano - uses DAG, PoW (HashCash).** Nano uses a block-lattice structure. Each account has its own blockchain (account-chain) equivalent to the account’s transaction/balance history. To add transaction user should make some HashCash PoW -> When user creates transaction Send Block appears on his blockchain and Receive block appears on Recipients blockchain. -> Peers in View receive Block -> Peers verify block (Double spending and check if already in the ledger) -> Peers achieve consensus and add block. In case of Fork (when 2 or more signed blocks reference the same previous block): Nano network resolves forks via a balance-weighted voting system where representative nodes vote for the block they observe, as >50% of weighted votes received, consensus achieved and block is retained in the Node’s ledger (block that lose the vote is discarded).

**\[25\] Holochain - uses distributed hash table (DHT).** Instead of trying to manage global consensus for every change to a huge blockchain ledger, every participant has their own signed hash chain. In case of multi-party transaction, it is signed to each party's chain. Each party signs the exact same transaction with links to each of their previous chain entries. After data is signed to local chains, it is shared to a DHT where every neighbor node validate it. Any consensus algorithms can be built on top of Holochain.

**\[26\] Komodo ('Delegated' Delayed Proof of Work (dPoW**)) - end-to-end blockchain solutions. DPoW consensus mechanism does not recognize The Longest Chain Rule to resolve a conflict in the network, instead the dPoW looks to backups it inserted previously into the chosen PoW blockchain. The process of inserting backups of Komodo transactions into a secure PoW is “notarization.” Notarisation is performed by the elected Notary nodes. Roughly every ten minutes, the Notary nodes perform a special block hash mined on the Komodo blockchain and take note of the overall Komodo blockchain “height”. The notary nodes process this specifc block so that their signatures are cryptographically included within the content of the notarized data. There are sixty-four “Notary nodes” elected by a stake-weighted vote, where ownership of KMD represents stake in the election. They are a special type of blockchain miner, having certain features in their underlying code that enable them to maintain an effective and cost-efcient blockchain and they periodically receives the privilege to mine a block on “easy difculty.”

0xBTC Community Update," Enjoy!

# 0xBTC Community Update #1

*This is the first of an intended series of recurring community updates. Our goal is to issue these biweekly, for now, and possibly more or less frequently as news may dictate.*

The past month has been one of blistering growth for 0xBitcoin (0xBTC) and there are many exciting things in the pipeline! We have seen a dramatic increase in awareness and adoption and our community is growing rapidly. As many of you know, 0xBTC is the first proof of work currency on the ethereum network. There was no ICO, no pre-mine and everyone who owns this coin either earned it through mining or purchased it from another community member. The group drafting this letter has no extra control or power over the token — we are just active community members who want to see 0xBTC succeed.

**Overview of Our Recent Growth.** The table below provides an overview of several growth statistics regarding 0xBTC.

0xBTC GROWTH STATISTICS  
May 15th to June 15th   
Unique Wallet Addresses - 3,099 to 4,120 (+38&#37;)  
Reddit Subscribers - +/- 600 to 913 (+52&#37;)  
Discord Subscribers -1,373 to 2,475 (+80&#37;)  
Hashrate 1.14 TH/s to 4.02 Th/s (+252&#37;)

**CoinMarketCap.** We were recently listed on CoinMarketCap, adding additional exposure. It took a few weeks to get the market cap and circulating supply updated given that this is the first mineable ERC 20 token. It is still unclear if the circulating supply they have on record is dynamic and changes with new supply numbers or if they put in a static placeholder. Thanks to the efforts of some community members we were able to get that mostly sorted out and now have a full listing.

**Additional Exchanges.** Exchanges are starting to take notice of 0xBTC as reflected by new listings on Mercatox, IDex, and PayFair. Community members have submitted applications for many other exchanges, with the [Discord channel](https://discord.gg/dkTbWd) being a good place to keep up to date on developments. Many members have pointed out likely “wash trading” on the Hotbit exchange, leading to its removal from our price and volume bot on the Discord. A community member also informed Coinmarketcap and LiveCoinWatch about our suspicions. LiveCoinWatch has removed Hotbit as per their request. We will continue to monitor for unusually high volume and, as a community, hopefully condemn such practices and distance ourselves from unscrupulous organizations.   
 

**Lava Wallet.** 0xBTC’s developer, Infernal\_Toast, recently completed and released the early stages of the Lava Wallet. The Lava Wallet allows the easy transfer of an ERC20 token between users. Using off-chain digital signatures and a network of relayers, users can send any ERC20 token without worrying about holding Ether for gas. Our hope is that 0xBTC will find more application use and personal use as a currency if it is easy to transfer as a standalone token.  
 

**What is Next for 0xBTC? Lots of things in the Works!**

**Formal Security Audit of Smart Contract.** While the 0xBTC code has been subject to a strict peer review, one initiative is to have a formal 3rd party audit review of the contract code. We believe this might be an important step towards mass adoption and growth, since a currency is unfeasible for use if there remains even a shred of doubt about its functionality. We are looking for low-cost solutions to this, as our community fund pool is limited at this time. The Discord is the best place for community members to give suggestions and work together on securing a fair price for a service from a reputable firm.

**Legal Determination that 0xBTC is not a Security.** The SEC is giving us more and more guidance each day as to what types of cryptocurrencies may or may not constitute a security. Based on available guidance, many of us believe if analyzed by legal counsel, 0xBTC would not be considered a security \[\*this is not a legal opinion\]. This is important for adoption, since securities are more highly regulated than commodities. There is a community initiative to seek a memorandum / written opinion letter from a United States securities lawyer stating that 0xBTC is not a security. Many of the larger exchanges require this kind of legal analysis — including Binance. This is one reason we were not part of the most recent “Binance Community Coin 7 Vote.”

**Marketing Campaign —** We would like to raise funds to engage in a marketing campaign to spread awareness of 0xBTC. The full details of this have not yet been determined, but we hope that community involvement will lead us to a good decision on where our community funding should go.  
 

**Games and Competitions.** Some users are looking at setting up various DAPPS/games/competitions all involving 0xBTC. Some of these might involve gambling, such as sports betting platforms. Please keep in mind that some projects built by community members will not have undergone audits for security. Also, while the vast majority of community made projects are for the benefit and/or recreation of the community, please be wary of scams targeting our community. As 0xBTC increases in adoption and reach, our community will increasingly become a target for such activities. Have fun and play responsibly.

**0xBTC Foundation.** We are looking into forming a 501(c)(6) non-profit entity (the “Foundation”) which will serve to promote 0xBTC through spreading awareness and advancing the short and long term initiatives. There will be an initial, provisional board of directors (or equivalent structure) established to set up the foundation and start working on the goals. Once established, anyone can seek to join the board and we plan to figure out an election method. **Note that the initial board members don’t get paid or have any power in excess of any one token holder**. The 0xBTC foundation will seek donations to fund some of the initiatives above. We are looking into creating a smart contract of some kind so that if anyone were to donate, they can be certain their funds go to the intended uses. As of now there is a small reserve fund of 19,125.16 0xBTC to be used for community efforts. Let’s make it grow!

**Remember — Imitation is the sincerest form of Flattery**

Given the success of 0xBTC, we have seen the rise of 0xBCH, 0xLTC, 0xDoge and other “0x coins”. The fact that groups are “copying” and imitating 0xBTC is truly flattering and we want to thank all the other 0xBTC coins for their vote of confidence. We wish them all the best. With developments in [merge mining](https://medium.com/@mseiler1/merged-mining-mineable-tokens-6d532cc0d285)there is even the possibility of having other mineable tokens tie their mining to the mining of 0xBTC, furthering increasing adoption of the token and beginning to define 0xBTC as the standard for store of value on the Ethereum network.

Which Are Your Top 5 Platforms Out Of The Top100? An Analysis.,"There are currently a lot of platforms, more specifically, there are 35 platforms within the Top100 only and many do very similar things. How is one supposed to know how they differ? That was the question that I asked myself.

So, I decided to compare all platforms within the Top100. I noticed that they can be put into into 5 different categories. Note: A platform is a cryptocurrency that offers smart contracts at least.

1. Dapps platforms \- 12
2. BaaS \- 11
3. Liquidity \- 2
4. Misc \- 7
5. Behemoths \-3

Here are all platforms in an excel spread sheet in their categories with a description: [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1s8PHcNvvjuy848q18py\_CGcu8elRGQAUIf86EYh4QZo/edit#gid=268170779](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1s8PHcNvvjuy848q18py_CGcu8elRGQAUIf86EYh4QZo/edit#gid=268170779)

In order to find out which one is the best platform in each market currently and made sure to be strict with every platform and point out their flaws.

Let's look at the 5 markets.

# 1) Dapps platforms

Dapps platforms are definitely a solid bet for the next years. Besides Ethereum, Neo, EOS and Stellar are probably the most known here, however, all 4 are simply extremely centralized and would need to completely change their architecture to become more decentralized. Until that happens, none of these platform can really be considered as a platform with good technology, since everyone can achieve high scalability by letting a few hundred nodes do the consensus algorithm. There is nothing difficult about that. The difficulty is achieving several million TPS with 100,000 nodes deciding consensus.

Cardano, Aeternity are the only ones that seem to be able to maintain excellent decentralization with high scalability, because they scale through side\-chains/horizontally.

All platforms considered, Ethereum seems to be on the way there as well with its change to Casper.

1. Cardano has a great team, has probably the most secure PoS that was peer\-reviewed in a scientific approach, has their mainnet launched, has near infinite scalability through sidechains and offers broad usability of Smart contracts in a number of programming languages.
2. Ethereum is a 2nd generation blockchain that allows the use of smart contracts and dapps on a smaller scope. Ethereum currently has bad scalability, though this concern could be alleviated by the soon to be implemented Sharding concept and its new PoS/PoW consensus algorithm Casper. Still, there are platforms with much more comprehensive dapp ecosystems, and much more scalability. However, Ethereum just closed a partnership with AWS. This is probalby the biggest partnership in the cryptosphere. Though, in order to be better than any of the top 3 platforms, it would need to provide Oracles, a lot more functionality for dapps, partnerships, decentralized data storage, cloud computing.
3. Neblio is similar to NEO and a good platform, though it has a much smaller market cap.
4. EOS has high scalability, though is much more centralized than Skycoin, Elastos and Cardano. However, it offers a lot of functionality for Dapps. EOS is overhyped. It is on the same level as Neblio, Neo, Aeternity, but not on the same level as Skycoin, Elastos, IOTA, Cardano.
5. NEO is a very established platform in this category.However, Neo dapps scale on\-chain and can thus clog the network quickly. For that reason, NEO had to pick a very centralized approach to maintain scalability and it looking to rely on hand\-picked nodes to maintain scalability in the future, very similar to EOS also very centralized approach of 121 handpicked nodes.
6. Stellar has similar goals as Ripple, only that it is more a platform than only a currency, so it does offer more functionality. . Stellar uses Byzantine Fault Tolerance in the consensus protocol, which ensures secure consensus can be reached (moving the blockchain forward) even if a large percentage of nodes are disabled or acting dishonestly. It also helps keep nodes distributed. Stellar is a good platform with tight involvement with banks. While it doesn't have as much functionality as all above platforms, it can probably carve out its niche by doing really good business with banks.
7. Aeternity: We’ve seen recently, that it’s difficult to scale the execution of smart contracts on the blockchain. Crypto Kitties is a great example. Something as simple as creating and trading unique assets on Ethereum bogged the network down when transaction volume soared. Ethereum and Zilliqa address this problem with Sharding. Aeternity focuses on increasing the scalability of smart contracts and dapps by moving smart contracts off\-chain. Instead of running on the blockchain, smart contracts on Aeternity run in private state channels between the parties involved in the contracts. State channels are lines of communication between parties in a smart contract. They don’t touch the blockchain unless they need to for adjudication or transfer of value. Because they’re off\-chain, state channel contracts can operate much more efficiently. They don’t need to pay the network for every time they compute and can also operate with greater privacy. An important aspect of smart contract and dapp development is access to outside data sources. This could mean checking the weather in London, score of a football game, or price of gold. Oracles provide access to data hosted outside the blockchain. In many blockchain projects, oracles represent a security risk and potential point of failure, since they tend to be singular, centralized data streams. Aeternity proposes decentralizing oracles with their oracle machine. Doing so would make outside data immutable and unchangeable once it reaches Aeternity’s blockchain. Of course, the data source could still be hacked, so Aeternity implements a prediction market where users can bet on the accuracy and honesty of incoming data from various oracles.It also uses prediction markets for various voting and verification purposes within the platform. Aeternity’s network runs on on a hybrid of proof of work and proof of stake. Founded by a long\-time crypto\-enthusiast and early colleague of Vitalik Buterin, Yanislav Malahov.
8. IOST: To improve speed and scalability, IOStoken uses a Proof of Believability consensus mechanism eliminating the need for an energy\-hungry proof\-of\-work protocol, which stands as a barrier to blockchain scaling up for widespread adoption. With this system, a node is validated based on its past contributions and behaviors. Moreover, to increase fairness and to most fully embrace the decentralized nature of the blockchain, IOS uses a “fairness” algorithm that randomly distributes data to various nodes. It’s intended to support service\-oriented goods and services with large customer bases. Decentralized applications and smart contracts, the hallmarks of blockchain platforms, are a priority for IOS as well.
9. Request Network: Req payments can be used for online purchases, business to business invoices, escrow, advanced payments and eventually IoT payments between machines. Other than payments, the Request Network is also tackling auditing and budget transparency. Businesses have the ability to track invoices to audit payments as well as record transactions for accounting purposes. Governments, nonprofits, and other organizations can also use Request to bring transparency to their budget and expenditures.
10. Rchain: Similar to Ethereum with smart contracts, though much more scalable at an expected 40,000 TPS and possible 100,000 TPS. However, Rchain has not launched ye..
11. Ziliqa: Zilliqa is building a new way of sharding, so that 10,000 tps are soon possible by being linearly scalable with the number of nodes. That means, the more nodes, the faster the network gets. They are looking at implementing privacy as well.Rchain is an ok platform.
12. Ethereum classic is the original Ethereum that decided not to fork after a hack for philosophical reasons. The Ethereum that we know is its fork.

# 2) BaaS (Blockchain-as-a-Service)

BaaS take a different route to adoption than mere Dapps platforms. They are also dapp platforms, but focus on businesses (B2B) instead of end\-users (B2C) within the cryptosphere. They sell their blockchain services to companies, who then can build their own customizable blockchain as a side\-chain to the BaaS without hassle and worry about technology or blockchain architecture. This is all handled by the BaaS company already and the customer only needs to change a few variables and they have their own blockchain. Side\-chains are interesting, because they allow virtually infinite scaling, since there can be an infinite number of side\-chains that only communicate with the main\-chain occasionally and handle the majority of transactions on their own chain. This is also called horizontal scaling.

The success of a BaaS platform largely depends on its ability to close partnerships to sell to large businesses and having the best usability. The more contracts they can sell to businesses and institutions, the more valuable it will be. For that reason, the BaaS with the best ability to form partnerships and do sales will win this market. Technology isn't as important here. Of course, the platform has to work without bugs, but having a platform with outstanding technology, average usability and average marketing will lose against a platform with average technology, great usability and great marketing.

1. VeChain is a Singapore\-based project that’s building a business enterprise platform and inventory tracking system. . While it is not really competing with the above mentioned platforms, any of them can build supply management tools into their platform and compete with VeChain. However, VeChain has very strong partnerships. This gives them some protection of any of the above mentioned entering the market. Examples are verifying genuine luxury goods and food supply chains. VeChain has one of the strongest communities in the crypto world. If you are looking for something more high risk, high return, have a look into Ambrosus and Devery(Eve). Both also seem to be good at building partnerships, which is the most important characteristic for a supply chain platform required to succeed.
2. Icon is called the Korean Ethereum. However, it specializes more on building customizable blockchains for banks, insurance providers, hospitals, and universities, since it's a BaaS. Icon has a focus on on ID verification and payments. Icon is ery close behind Vechain, because with Samsung and Line.
3. WTC is a supply chain management platform, similar to Vechain, however, with fewer partnerships.
4. Komodo’s open\-source platform is for doing transparent, anonymous, private, and fungible transactions. They are then made ultra\-secure using Bitcoin’s blockchain via a Delayed Proof of Work (dPoW) protocol and decentralized crowdfunding (ICO) platform to remove middlemen from project funding. Offers services for startups to create and manage their own Blockchains. While it doesn't have as many partnerships as other BaaS, it is the only BaaS that offers privacy so far. However, that's. it such a bug competitive advantage, since it can be replicated rather swiftly.
5. NEM: The NEM blockchain powers what they call the Smart Asset System. This system is intended to be an open, customizable blockchain solution for any number of use cases built on top of simple, powerful API calls. NEM started as a NXT fork and introduced a new consensus mechanism called Proof of Importance (PoI), designed to reward users’ contribution to the XEM community. It is roughly based on proof\-of\-stake, but it also reflects how active a user is in transacting with other users. POW rewards powerful computers and also requires excessive amounts of energy. POS gives an unfair advantage to coin hoarders. The more coins they keep in their accounts, the more they earn, meaning that the rich get richer and everyone has an incentive to save coins instead of spending them.
6. Ark is a fork of Lisk, which is doubling down on a smaller feature set than Lisk. Ark is a good BaaS, though it doesn't have many partnerships. Furthermore, they haven't launched their platform yet.
7. Dragonchain: The Purpose of DragonChain is to help companies quickly and easily incorporate blockchain into their business applications. Many companies might be interested in making this transition because of the benefits associated with serving clients over a blockchain – increased efficiency and security for transactions, a reduction of costs from eliminating potential fraud and scams, etc. Dragonchain is a good BaaS, though it doesn't have many partnerships. However, it was funded by Disney, so it might be able to get partnerships more easy.
8. LISK: Lisk's difference to other BaaS is that side chains are independent to the main chain and have to have their own nodes. Similar to neo whole allows dapps to deploy their blockchain too. Lisk is a good BaaS, though it doesn't have many partnerships. Furthermore, they haven't launched their platform yet.
9. Stratis: Different to LISK, Stratis will allow businesses and organizations to create their own blockchain according to their own needs, but secured on the parent Stratis chain. Stratis’s simple interface will allow organizations to quickly and easily deploy and/or test blockchain functionality of the Ethereum, BitShares, BitCoin, Lisk and Stratis environements.Stratis is similar to Lisk, but also doesn't have many partnerships
10. ARDR: Ardor is a public blockchain platform that will allow people to utilize the blockchain technology of Nxt through the use of child chains. A child chain, which is a ‘light’ blockchain that can be customized to a certain extent, is designed to allow easy self\-deploy for your own blockchain. Nxt claims that users will ""not need to worry"" about security, as that part is now handled by the main chain (Ardor). This is the chief innovation of Ardor. Ardor was evolved from NXT by the same company. NEM started as a NXT clone.
11. Bytom: Bytom is an interactive protocol of multiple financial assets ( digital currency, digital assets warrants, securities, dividends, bonds, intelligence information, forecasting information and other information that exist in the physical world) can be registered, exchanged, gambled and engaged in other more complicated and contract\-based interoperations via Bytom.

# 3) Liquidity

There are really only 2 platforms in the Liquidity market, albeit the Liquidity market could be one of the biggest markets with insitutional investors entering the cryptoworld soon, since there is very little liquidity in Bitcoin. For example, say a pension fund wants to buy or sell $10B in Bitcoins. No single exchange has that many Bitcoins available and it would wreak havoc on the market. This wouldn't be a problem with Liquidity platforms, since they pull all order books together and back up market liquidity with FIAT money among other things.

1. QASH is used to fuel its liquid platform which will be an exchange that will distribute their liquidity pool. Its product, the Worldbook is a multi\-exchange order book that matches crypto to crypto, and crypto to fiat and the reverse across all currencies. E.g., someone is selling Bitcoin is USD on exchange1 not owned by Quoine and someone is buying Bitcoin in EURO on exchange 2 not owned by Quoine. If the forex conversions and crypto conversions match then the trade will go through and the Worldbook will match it, it'll make the sale and the purchase on either exchange and each user will get what they wanted, which means exchanges with lower liquidity if they join the Worldbook will be able to fill orders and take trade fees they otherwise would miss out on.They turned it on to test it a few months ago for an hour or so and their exchange was the top exchange in the world by 4x volume for the day because all Worldbook trades ran through it. Binance wants BNB to be used on their one exchange. Qash wants their QASH token embedded in all of their partners. More info here [https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/8a8lnr/which\_are\_your\_top\_5\_favourite\_coins\_out\_of\_the/dwyjcbb/?context=3Qash](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/8a8lnr/which_are_your_top_5_favourite_coins_out_of_the/dwyjcbb/?context=3Qash) is doing something completely different as the above mentioned. It offers liquidity in an illiquid market. Sell shovels during a gold rush.
2. Loopring is similar to Qash, only that it functions as a dezentralized exchange, while QASH is more of an API without a user interface. It is a protocol that will enable higher liquidity between exchanges and personal wallets by pooling all orders sent to its network and fill these orders through the order books of multiple exchanges. When using Loopring, traders never have to deposit funds into an exchange to begin trading. Even with decentralized exchanges like Ether Delta, IDex, or Bitshares, you’d have to deposit your funds onto the platform, usually via an Ethereum smart contract. But with Loopring, funds always remain in user wallets and are never locked by orders. This gives you complete autonomy over your funds while trading, allowing you to cancel, trim, or increase an order before it is executed.

# 4) Misc

These are platforms that are focused on a specialized functionality

1. Nebulas: Similar to how google indexes webpages Nebulas will index blockchain projects, smart contracts & data using the Nebulas rank algorithm that sifts & sorts the data. Developers rewarded NAS to develop & deploy on NAS chain. Nebulas calls this developer incentive protocol – basically rewards are issued based on how often dapp/contract etc. is used, the more the better the rewards and Proof of devotion. Works like DPoS except the best, most economically incentivised developers (Bookkeepers) get the forging spots. Ensuring brains stay with the project (Cross between PoI & PoS). 2,400 TPS\+, DAG used to solve the inter\-transaction dependencies in the PEE (Parallel Execution Environment) feature, first crypto Wallet that supports the Lightening Network.Nebulas is the only one doing what it's doing. This makes them very unique and a good investment.
2. Centrality is a decentralized market place for dapps that are all connected together on a blockchain\-powered system. Centrality aims to allow businesses to work together using blockchain technology. With Centrality, startups can collaborate through shared acquisition of customers, data, merchants, and content. That shared acquisition occurs across the Centrality blockchain, which hosts a number of decentralized apps called Scenes. Companies can use CENTRA tokens to purchase Scenes for their app, then leverage the power of the Centrality ecosystem to quickly scale. Some of Centrality's top dapps are, Skoot, a travel experience marketplace that consists of a virtual companion designed for free independent travelers and inbound visitors, Belong, a marketplace and an employee engagement platform that seems at helping business provide rewards for employees, Merge, a smart travel app that acts as a time management system, Ushare, a transports application that works across rental cars, public transport, taxi services, electric bikes and more. All of these dapps are able to communicate with each other and exchange data through Centrality. Centrality is the only one doing what it's doing. This makes them very unique and a good investment.
3. Salt: Leveraging blockchain assets to secure cash loans. Plans to offer cash loans in traditional currencies, backed by your cryptocurrency assets. Allows lenders worldwide to skip credit checks for easier access to affordable loans.Salt is a good lending platform. However, there is also Elixir, a better investment with a 30x smaller market cap, but also strong technology. Elixir has such a low market cap, because they didn't have an ICO and they only focused on development and no marketing. As of last week, they started marketing.
4. Aion: Today, there are hundreds of blockchains. In the coming years, those hundreds will become thousands and—with ,widespread adoption by mainstream business and government—millions. Blockchains don’t talk to each other at all right now, they are like the PCs of the 1980s. The Aion network is able to support custom blockchain architectures while still allowing for cross\-chain interoperability by enabling users to exchange data between any Aion\-compliant blockchains by making use of an interchain framework that allows for messages to be relayed between blockchains in a completely trust\-free manner.
5. Waves is a decentralized exchange and crowdfunding platform by letting companies and projects to issue and manage their own digital coin tokens to raise money.
6. ChainLink is a decentralized oracle service, the first of its kind. Oracles are defined as an ‘agent’ that finds and verifies real\-world occurrences and submits this information to a blockchain to be used in smart contracts.With ChainLink, smart contract users can use the network’s oracles to retrieve data from off\-chain application program interfaces (APIs), data pools, and other resources and integrate them into the blockchain and smart contracts. Basically, ChainLink takes information that is external to blockchain applications and puts it on\-chain. The difference to Aeternity is that Chainlink deploys the smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain. Chainlink's main functionality is oracles, a functionality also offered by IOTA.
7. QTUM: Smart Contracts on the Bitcoin blockchain. QTUM is a smart contracts for BTC, a very niche market. Furthermore, BTC might offer smart contracts itself soon and make QTUM obsolete. Hopefully QTUM will expand into more smart contracts functionality to become relevant again.

Nebulas with Indexing the Blockchain world and Salt with Lending are probably the 2 most interesting platforms here. Nebulas doesn't have a single competitor, though there are several competitors to Salt with a much smaller market cap and with similar development progress, ELIX.

# 5) Behemoths

There are 3 platforms that have not been discussed yet. However, they can do most what the above platforms can do and have the potential to steal the market of all above mentioned platforms. That's why I call them behemoths.

1.) Skycoin :Skycoin is building what Pied Piper is building in the series HBO's Silicon Valley, a completely decentralized internet that is not run by ISPs, but by IoT devices, making telecom providers like Comcast, ISPs who can control bandwith, cost, net neutrality, filters, access etc. obsolete and completely decentralize them. Skycoin offers what 36 coins are offering: 

1. 12 Scalable Currency (Bitcoin, Ripple, Bitcoin Cash, Litecoin, Dash, Bitcoin Gold, Nano, Bitcoin Diamond, Dogecoin, Digibyte, Decred, Bitcoin Atom)
2. 10 Smart Contract and Dapps platforms (Cardano, Ethereum, Neblio, EOS, Stellar, Neo, Rchain, IOST, Ziliqa, Eth classic)
3. 10 BaaS (VeChain, Icon, WTC, Ontology, Komodo, NEM, Ark, Dragonchain, LISK, Stratis).
4. 4 Decentralized Storage (Siacoin, Maidsafe, Gybte, Storj)

If you think that the decentralized Internet will blow all other markets out of the water and will be the biggest invention of this decade, then Skycoin is your pick, because covers that and what 27 coins do.

2.) IOTA: With the launch of Q 1 week ago, IOTA is about to offer what 27 platforms within the Top 100 are offering (!) and they are probably looking to replace several more.

1. 12 Scalable Currency (Bitcoin, Ripple, Bitcoin Cash, Litecoin, Dash, Bitcoin Gold, Nano, Bitcoin Diamond, Dogecoin, Digibyte, Decred, Bitcoin Atom.)
2. 10 Smart Contract and Dapps platforms (Cardano, Ethereum, Neblio, EOS, Stellar, Neo, Rchain, IOST, Ziliqa, Eth classic)
3. 2 Oracles (Aeternity, ChainLink)
4. 3 Outsourced Cloud Computing (DBC, Aelf, Golem)

IOTA is at the same level as Skycoin and Elastos. However, SKY's flagship product is the Decentralized Internet and ELA's is the most comprehensive dapps operating system in the cryptosphere, which IOTA cannot really replicate in the near future, because it takes years of reseach and development. This protects ELA and SKY from IOTA for now. 

However, it looks like IOTA can snatch up all the smaller, easier to replicate markets, such as cloud computing, oracles, smart contracts, decentralized storage, currency exchange and soon possibly also supply chain management, BaaS functionality, privacy, security identification since none of those are really hard to build. However, Skycoin and Elastos will probably focus on their flagships and leave IOTA to scoop up all the rest. It will be an interesting year.

3.) Elastos started out as a mobile operating system 18 years ago and has now moved towards a smart contracts platform, operating system and a runtime environment for Dapps. Thanks to side\-chains they are near infinitely scalable and is thus also very decentralized. Elastos is offering what 36 coins are offering

1. 12 Scalable Currency (Bitcoin, Ripple, Bitcoin Cash, Litecoin, Dash, Bitcoin Gold, Nano, Bitcoin Diamond, Dogecoin, Digibyte, Decred, Bitcoin Atom.)
2. 10 Smart Contract and Dapps platforms (Cardano, Ethereum, Neblio, EOS, Stellar, Neo, Rchain, IOST, Ziliqa, Eth classic)
3. 10 BaaS (VeChain, Icon, WTC, Ontology, Komodo, NEM, Ark, Dragonchain, LISK, Stratis).
4. 4 Decentralized Storage (Siacoin, Maidsafe, Gybte, Storj)

If you are very convinced that BaaS solutions and dapps platforms will be the big winners for 2018, then Elastos is your pick as far as I can see, because it is probably the best BaaS and dapps platform with near infinite scalability and the best decentralization and thus does what 32 coins do.

3 Closing Questions

All of the above findings leave me with those 3 questions. What are your thoughts?

1. Why invest in any of Dapps platforms (Cardano, Neblio, EOS, Stellar, Neo, Aeternity, Rchain, IOST, Ziliqa, Ethereum, Eth classic) when Elastos and Skycoin do everything they do, are much more decentralized and scalable through side\-chain/off\-chain/horizontal scaling and offer lots more functionality beyond that?
2. Why invest in any BaaS (Ontology, Komodo, NEM, Ark ,Dragonchain, LISK, Stratis, ARDR) if ICX and VeChain offer everything what all of the above offer and already have 10x more partnerships than their competitors?
3. It looks like out of all 35 platforms, only 5 are really strong: IOTA, Skycoin, Elastos, VeChain, ICX. While the first 3 seem to cover already almost half of the top 100, the last 2 really convince in the partnership department. What's the argument for investing in any of the 30 other platforms? Maybe that they can specialise on a specific feature set, however, is this really a convincing argument? The cryptoworld is harsh and if you can't keep up with competition, you'll be moved out of the market quickly.",127.0,2018-06-12 13:53:59,0.93
[GIT] Weekly Update 18,"Hey everyone,

First of all, I’m sorry there was no update last week. I went on a little trip last weekend and even though I’d planned to do a post I just didn’t have the conditions to do a quality update at the standard I want to give you guys. On the other side, the Raiden team didn’t take a single day off and there are multiple new updates I would like to cover in this post. For that reason, I will try to keep this post as focused on development progress as possible with only one small topic unrelated to Raiden’s development progress.

**Raiden development progress**

The team is currently working towards reaching the Red Eyes milestone. Once the Red Eyes milestone has been reached, Raiden will be released on the main net. The release date was announced to be sometime this Summer and the good news is that the team seemed confident they will be able to manage it.

The Red Eyes milestone goal has four big meta issues it’s aimed to solve.

Issues are:

* Recoverability of the Raiden client
* Refactoring
* Integration of smart contracts
* Implementation of Matrix as a transport protocol

**Recoverability of the Raiden client**

Recoverability is a software’s ability to handle unexpected events by itself, or with very little user interaction. An example of an unexpected event would be a power outage. Software that has sufficient recoverability in event of power outage wouldn’t lose any data and should have no trouble with continuing its work once power is restored.

The team made good progress with this feature. If we check the remaining recoverability related issues in the Red Eyes milestone on github, we can see that the meta recoverability issue has ten out of thirteen subtasks completed.

**Refactoring**

Refactoring of code is a process where the codebase undergoes changes, but no new features are added. An example of this would be the optimization of existing features.

The biggest part of refactoring was done inside the contracts repository and if we check what the open refactoring related issues are inside the contract repository Red Eyes milestone goal, we can see that there are none left. Inside the Raiden client github repository there are no refactoring related issues left.

**Integration of Matrix Protocol**

Since the team decided to implement Matrix as their go to transport protocol, a big merge where the majority of the features were added was done few weeks ago but that sprouted several smaller issues which the team is actively working on sorting out. A large effort is put into testing everything and we can expect a few more smaller issues to arise over time, but that’s just normal during a testing phase.

**Integration of smart contracts**

The integration of smart contracts is a feature that got the least love up until now. The reason being was the fact that the team had to prepare everything inside the contracts repository first, before they could start working on integration itself. As we already mentioned, the contract repository is ready now, so I expect the work on integration will start very soon.

Issue #1383 is sort of meta issue for this feature and we can see it has nine subtasks inside of it. The team has split up the meta issue into smaller issues \(#1476, #1478, #1479, ...\) and assigned each of the smaller ones to a different team member. The biggest problem now is that several people are working on the same thing at the same time and it takes careful planning to prevent stepping on each other’s toes. Apart from some team members working on the smart contract integration, a few other team members will work on different issues at the same time. I’m sure they will handle it with the least trouble possible, so I’m not worried at all about that.

**Miscellaneous** 

Aside from development, the team’s putting a lot of effort in testing everything the best they can. Results of testing can’t be seen directly, but every time there is a bug fixed, you can be sure they found it by testing every possible scenario.

Last week the team added a complimentary milestone goal called ‘Red Eyes Deployment’ to Raiden’s client repository. The purpose of the separate milestone was they wanted to avoid cluttering up the ‘Red Eyes’ milestone goal with features not necessary for Red Eyes itself, but the features added to the ‘Red Eyes Deployment’ milestone would still be necessary for proper deployment, launch and usage of the Red Eyes version of the network. This includes secondary infrastructure, documentation, tutorials e.t.c.

**EIP 712**

As you probably know, but it is worth repeating for the new readers, EIP 712 is a key feature that needs to be added to Ethereum code base so µRaiden can reach MVP release.

The developer community members interested in the proposal added several more changes to the pull request and it seems that the community is not far from reaching the final agreement about what should be covered in this proposal and how it should be implemented.

It’s been almost nine months since EIP 712 was first proposed and at some points it seemed that consensus will never be reached, but right now I feel the situation has significantly improved. It is hard to say when the work around EIP 712 will be finalized, but it feels to me that we are not that far away.

Even though EIP 712 is needed for µRaiden’s MVP release, it’s not stopping projects interested in the tech from working with µRaiden.

**Conclusion**

There we are! I would like to thank /u/Mat7ias and Lefteris for helping me once again with my post and everyone in the community for the big support. I am sorry if you were expecting a post last week and I didn’t deliver, but if it means anything I had great fun last weekend :\). As always, any questions are more than welcome and I will give my best to answer them best I can.

Cheers!",28.0,2018-06-03 16:52:57,0.92
End of day summary - 05/21,"The Dow rose 298.20, or 1.21%, to 25,013.29, the Nasdaq gained 39.70, or 0.54%, to 7,394.04, and the S&P 500 advanced 19.73, or 0.73%, to 2,732.70.

---

Stocks opened sharply higher as trade tensions between China and the U.S. have eased for the time being. The market added some additional gains during the opening hours of trading but once the averages found a level, they moved in a narrow range. With today's advance, the Dow moved back above 25,000 for the first time since early March. 

**Weekend comments from Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, who said that a trade war between the U.S. and China has been put on hold, helped the U.S. stock market rebound from last week's losses on Monday.** The major averages did settle below their session highs -- the Nasdaq (+0.5%) notably so -- but the Dow (+1.2%) and the S&P 500 (+0.7%) still finished with comfortable gains. The small-cap Russell 2000 (+0.7%) advanced to a new record high for the fourth session in a row.

The industrial sector (+1.5%) finished at the top of the sector standings. The group benefited from a 3.6% increase in shares of BA, which have served as a proxy for trade concerns. Meanwhile, GE shares also had a positive outing, adding 1.9%, after the 126-year-old giant unveiled an $11.1 billion deal to merge its transportation business with locomotive manufacturer WAB. GE shares did give back some gains though following reports that further dividend cuts (or even dividend elimination) are possible.

**Technology (+0.8%) got off to a good start, vying with industrials for first place in the sector standings, but eventually fell back.** Shares of several chipmakers, including NVDA and Texas Instruments TXN, weighed on the group, but shares of MU rallied 3.9% after the company raised its fiscal Q3 guidance.

Elsewhere, the lightly-weighted telecom services (+1.5%) and real estate (+1.0%) sectors were also notable advancers, trimming their losses for the year, as was the energy group (+1.0%), which took advantage of another rise in the price of crude oil. WTI crude futures advanced 1.4% to $72.26 per barrel, marking their highest close since November 2014. On the downside, the health care group (+0.1%) finished at the bottom of the sector standings as biotechnology shares weighed, evidenced by a 1.3% decline in the IBB. Shares of biotech giant **CELG were particularly weak, closing lower by 4.7%; that marks an eight-month loss of around 50% for Celgene.**

Among the noteworthy gainers was PLAY, which rose 6% after Maxim raised its price target on the shares to $68 from $62, saying that the company's launch of VR gaming and its ""revamped"" Eat 'N Play food/beverage value platform will prove to be catalysts. Among the notable losers was BIDU, which fell 5% after it agreed to divest its Global DU business. Also lower was QD, which dropped nearly 17% after reporting quarterly results. 

In the Asia-Pacific region, equity indices closed moderately higher. Japan's Nikkei 225 edged up by 0.31 percent, or 72.01 points, to 23,002.37, crossing the 23,000 mark for the first time since February as the dollar firmed against the yen. 

# Currency

The U.S. Dollar Index is up 0.05% to 93.68, following course for its sixth straight gain. The greenback is drawing support from an easing of trade tension between the U.S. and China that prompted risk-on sentiment in the U.S. equity market.

[GIT] Weekly Update 17,"Hey everyone,

I hope you’re ready for another weekly recap. This week again I got help from [u/Mat7ias](https://www.reddit.com/user/Mat7ias) and Lefteris, but since as we all know Lefteris is in Boston, presenting Raiden on L2 Summit, I didn’t want to bother him too much. Apart from standard retrospective on development progress in last week, there are two more topics I want to cover in this post. So, let’s start.

**New activity in EIP 712**

In case you forgot, EIP 712 is what’s holding back the release of µRaiden MVP. The proposal got a little messy so it hasn’t yet been resolved and merged even though it’s been quite some time since it was created as an Ethereum Improvement Proposal \(EIP\).

There wasn’t much activity around the EIP in the last couple of weeks, that is up until a few days ago. Nick Johnson, who has authority to approve and merge the changes suggested in EIP 712, reviewed the whole EIP once again and he left a few more change requests. His activity sparked more discussion inside the thread  \([https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/pull/712](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/pull/712)\).

It is hard to say how close the Ethereum community is to reaching consensus and merging this Improvement Proposal, but progress is evidently there.

I would like to take a chance to repeat that even though EIP 712 is impacting µRaiden MVP release, it’s not stopping other projects from working with µRaiden.

**L2 Summit**

L2 Summit was the conference that was held in Boston at the end of this week. The main focus of the conference was Layer 2 protocols. Raiden is a Layer 2 protocol, so Brainbot decided to participate by sending Lefteris to join the State Channel Panel.Videos from the conference are not yet available, so I had to use multiple sources to reconstruct what was going on there.From the information I found, the conference went great. To keep it short I made a list of all the things that happened at the conference:

* Temperature dropped 10 degrees Celsius on the first day, catching Lefteris off guard a little bit. Let’s hope he didn’t catch a cold because of that :\)
* Day one started with multiple presentations about new ideas in second layer protocols. If you are interested what exactly the presentations were about, the live twitter updates Lefteris \([https://twitter.com/LefterisJP](https://twitter.com/LefterisJP)\) and  Patrick \([https://twitter.com/paddyucl](https://twitter.com/paddyucl)\) \(researcher from UCL\)  made are the best sources I could find so far
* Later that day was the State Channel Panel where they had an open discussion about second layer protocols. Raiden’s side of the story was presented by Lefteris
* Lefteris mentioned on twitter that he synced with Conner \([https://twitter.com/bitconner](https://twitter.com/bitconner)\) and Alex Bosworth \([https://twitter.com/alexbosworth](https://twitter.com/alexbosworth)\) from Lightning labs and Interledger. There was a number of more significant network discussions so the event was very productive.
* On second day a hackathon was held where devs \(many of whom were students\) gave their best shot at tinkering with layer two protocols

All in all many talks were held, new ideas were exchanged about solving engineering challenges for second layer protocols, which I feel is the most important takeaway from the event. We are still eagerly waiting for videos and I will let you all know once they are available.

**Development progress**

Summer is coming quick and the team is wasting no time. They’re still in a phase where several big merges happen each week. They could split those big issues in few smaller ones, but end result would be the same.

I was wondering if the lists of issues in Red Eyes milestone are final or there might be another planning phase where they will add new ones. The lists are indeed more or less final. Of course, some smaller ones pop up during the development and they sort those out as well. The big issues may get split into smaller issues in the future but they will still follow the goals set out by the milestone.

Biggest addition to the code base this week was the smart contract for the monitoring service. It is a big feature so reviewing and correcting it took a lot of time, but it is merged now. Another big one was handling of the locked amount in raiden client repository.

Several smaller issues were tackled as well and were successfully reviewed and merged to the code base and a few are waiting for review.

In the spec repository we can see they added a description for how things work if you want to withdraw funds from channel without closing it and how cooperative settle works. The interesting thing about topping up a channel and withdrawing while the channel is open is that it’s a really difficult thing to implement for Lightning on the Bitcoin blockchain. A special technique called Splicing was invented to solve this problem and it's still a work in progress.

**Conclusion**

Progress in EIP712, L2 Summit in Boston and several big features completed are three major things to take away from the last week. I want to thank everyone for the support and the guys who helped me in creating this post. With every week behind us, the future is looking a little brighter and I think that is the most important thing currently. As always I am open to any questions in the comments and I will give my best to answer them best I can.

Have a good one!

Please put Holochain in 100 (or 200) words into the sidebar,"Take your pick, but one of the following should be in the sidebar and be the first thing people read.

[Here’s Holochain in 100, 200, and 500 words](https://medium.com/h-o-l-o/heres-holochain-in-100-200-and-500-words-509818aa3c88) by Holochain

**Holochain in exactly 100 words**

Holochain provides a data structure that can be used to build decentralized apps. You have your own chain, which you can add data to, including financial transactions. The chains can merge, split, and interact in complex ways. The data is stored in a decentralized way (like Bittorrent). The data has a hash, which is a mathematical fingerprint that corresponds to the data. If someone tampers with the data, the mismatch between the data and the hash will be noticed, and the data rejected as invalid. Digital signatures guarantee the authorship of the data. It’s Bittorrent plus git plus digital signatures.

**Holochain in exactly 200 words**

Holochain is a more efficient alternative to blockchain. The Ethereum blockchain burns through huge amounts of computational power. It does that to achieve a universal consensus, to make sure everyone agrees on where all the coins are.

Holochain has no native currency, it’s a “roll your own currency” crypto-accounting platform. Instead of watching coins, we keep an eye on accounts. Invalid transactions (increasing balance illicitly) simply get rejected by the network.

This eliminates the need for consensus, and that allows us to make our computing much more efficient. We reckon it will be at least 10,000 times more efficient than Ethereum.

There is huge interest in developing decentralized applications, but sooner or later they run into the inherent problems of blockchain. Besides being inefficient, Ethereum uses a unique programming language called Solidity. Solidity developers are in short supply, and I have seen many projects delayed by this shortage. Holochain supports Javascript and Lisp. There are many Javascript developers to every Solidity developer, so development of distributed applications will move along quicker.

The holochain-based hosting network, Holo, will launch in the third quarter of 2018. You can get HOT tokens now in our pre-sale, and exchange them for Holo fuel then.

**Holochain in exactly 500 words**

Holochain combines hashing, digital signatures, and DHTs to form a tamper-proof distributed ledger.

Hashing is a technique that collapses a bunch of data into a fingerprint that looks like this:

6d28d7cf56c26dd99752b0cafc1b14865846e660
If you change just one byte in the data, it no longer matches the hash. If you download a software program, and make sure what you downloaded has the proper hash, then you know that no one has inserted any malware or funny stuff.

Dual-key cryptography is a basic cryptographic technique, used in all sorts of ways in computer science. There is a public key (like a username) that is shared with the world, and a private key (like a password) that is not.

Dual-key cryptography is used to create digital signatures. Digital signatures work like this: I take a message, combine it with my private key, and stir it with some mathematics to create a signature. You can look at the signature, the message and my public key, and verify that the owner of the corresponding private key signed that message. If the message was altered, the signature wouldn’t check out. If someone tried to sign it without knowing my private key (which I store offline), it wouldn’t check out. I trust a software publisher, I know their public key, and so I download the software and check they’ve signed it. That confirms that the software really came from them, and hasn’t been altered since they signed it.

If I stream video from YouTube, the video is stored on YouTube’s computers. I point my browser to a particular URL, and it downloads whatever file is sitting there. I am a recipient only. By contrast, a distributed hash table (DHT) is a thing that allows you to download data from your neighbours. With a DHT, I ask peers on the network, “Who has the file with the hash 23ae47x?”, download chunks of it from whoever has it near me, and then combine them to form a full file.

DHT downloads are faster and more resilient than downloading from a server. They also put less strain on the network. Imagine a group of friends all watch a viral video on YouTube. Every time one of them watches it, the server — which may be on the other side of the world — has to send it again. If they were watching using a peer-to-peer system like a DHT, once one of them had it, he could send it to his neighbours.

Because content on a DHT is identified by its hash, I always get exactly what I asked for; it’s impossible for an attacker to replace it with something fishy.

These are the tools that build holochains. Digital signatures ensure no one can mess with my ledger without leaving a trail of signatures. Hashing ensures the data transferred is exactly what was requested. A DHT decentralizes the storage of this data, so that it’s hosted by the community rather than a company. This makes it a secure, distributed, tamper-proof ledger.

[GIT] Weekly Update 15,"Hey everyone,

we have very eventful week behind us. There was a presentation on Raiden in Toronto on Edcon conference, development is coming along nicely and I have a feeling community is waking up from winter hibernation. I planned to do a separate post where I will comment Edcon presentation and share my perspective on Liquidity talking smack about Raiden, but I decided to include that in weekly github update. So, let's not be like Liquidity and be all talk and no work and start this week's post.

**Lefteris talk on Edcon**

If you missed it, there was a big conference in Toronto called edcon. Raiden was presented there by one of the core Raiden developers, Lefteris. You can find VOD from the conference in this subreddit, so I won't repost it again.

It was pretty short presentation \(only 15 minutes\) and at first it looks like nothing what we already didn't know was said. But, if you read between the lines you will realize how important this presentation was.

First of all, I want to congratulate Lefteris on executing respecatble presentation in front not so small crowd at the conference. Presentation itself was not perfect, but you have to give a guy some credit. He is one of the best blockchain devs in the world \(not a marketing/public speaker\) and not a native english speaker. Watching his presentation I had a feeling he wanted to explain many topics in depth, but then he would realize he had only 15 minutes and that would tip his balance during the talk. Fact that his talk was late due to whole conference being a little late, didn't help his concentration.

You have to realize one other thing. On a 2 day conference, holding a presentation is just a tip of an iceberg. Interlinking and mingling with other people from the tech field is so much more important. I am sure Lefteris with his hard not to love personality and incredible tech knowledge nailed that part. We can only guess what kind of agreements and deals he managed to negotiate.

So, with all that out of the way, let me tell you 3 key points I got from his talk and why I think this conference was a beginning of a new era in Raiden's relationship with a community. Even tho there is a general opinion in the community that Raiden team is not listening to its community, Lefteris presentation is a proof they are listening very closely and they decided to address some of the most common misconceptions.

There was a lot of talk how Brainbot is not hiring new devs to help with a project. I already explained how hiring an experienced developer takes at least 3 months \(interviews \+ waiting before he can leave current position\) and it can take up to 3 more months before that person gets to know code so he can really contribute. In his talk he presented that team is currently 14 devs strong and that this accusation is false. 14 developers is respectable number. To put in perspective, when Instagram got sold to Facebook for 1B, it had 13 people working in total \(cleaning lady is one of 13\).

Second key point Lefteris addressed are accusations how Brainbot acts like they are only ones working on scaling. Him comparing Raiden to other projects shows how they are very aware of other projects and they are following their progress closely.

Third, and to me most surprising thing that he said on a conference are rough estimations of when Red Eyes and Ithaca milestones are planned to be reached. If you missed it, Red Eyes is planned to be reached during summer and Ithaca by the end of the year. Reason why this was such a big surprise is because before the conference there was never official confirmation of any deadline. Even tho these were very rough estimations it is step in the right direction and I expect we will soon get more accurate and more often updates on when are release dates planned.

This is my personal view on his talk. If you have anything to add or any questions, be free to share/ask in comments :\).

**Liquidity trash talking**

Another interesting presentation on Edcon was one by Liquidity Network project. Since their code is not open source \(you can't see it if you are not an employee\) and they didn't have anything to showcase, they decided to spend their 15 minutes trash talking other projects.

Their comparison between Raiden and Liquidity Network can be summed up in 4 words: ""We gud, they bad"". I will immediately say, Raiden has its difficulties, but they are giving their best to sort them out. Liquidity is hiding their code, waving with their white paper and talking smack.

Their white paper is not even a complete product. I didn't study it in depth so I don't know if everything they say is possible, but let's say it is. Their white paper is more like a really cool feature of a small part of a project. Let me try to put it in perspective for you. Let's say Liquidity is actually Ethereum. Their white paper would cover Ethash and nothing else.

There was lots of talk how Liquidity will offer 0 gas transactions. If you read white paper you will see that 0 gas transactions are possible only in very best case. Let me ask you, what works mostly in it's optimal state?

**Red Eyes**

Let's remember ourselves what are 4 key features of Red Eyes milestone goal. Those would be:

* Recoverability of Raiden client
* Refactoring
* Integration of Smart Contracts
* Matrix transport protocol

Currently whole project \(with all the repositories\) is in phase where they do pretty big changes targeting one of 4 key features and they don't bother with smaller ones too much. Last week we had huge commit regarding refactoring, this week Matrix transport protocol was the focus. Since most of the logic regarding Matrix will be shared between all the services, most was merged into raiden\-libs \(shared repository between all the rest\). What they need to do now is implement using that logic in rest of the repositories. We can see that they already started doing that and we can expect more big important commits in rest of the repositories now.

One big merge happened in raiden client repository as well. Message queues were added and we can already see another big commit utilizing the first one in the reviewing phase. It is pretty big and I think it will take them couple more days before they merge that one as well.

Messages for communicating with pathfinding were worked on and format of messages representing fees was as well.

In many different repositories you can see ""work in progress"" commits targeting key features of Red Eyes milestone and I expect them to sort them one by one as the development is done.

All in all, commits are not coming very often but when they do, they are big and important.

**Ithaca**

Even tho Ithaca release is planned after Red Eyes, team is working on it as well. I won't go into details, to keep post short but progress is there. I expect them to add more issues in Ithaca goal in the future, so current list of features sitting in Ithaca milestone goal on github is not final.

**Conclusion**

Lefteris talk and big commits have marked the past week. Your support is great as always and I invite you to join us on Telegram if you are not already didn't. I am open to any questions as always and I will try to answer them best I can.

Keep your head up, good times are coming!

ERC 918 has been merged!,"As of this morning, the ERC 918 specification draft has been merged into the Ethereum EIP master branch. This is a big moment for not only 0xBitcoin, but for the future of mineable tokens in general. A few highlights of this specification include:

* EIP918Interface - This is the most general interface that contracts should follow, essentially only requires the mint() function
* Creation of optional merge() function for merged mining use cases
* AbstractERC918 - A more specific implementation that implements mint(), and breaks the preceding operations into 4 different phases, hash, reward, epoch and difficulty adjustments, each realized as separate abstract internal functions to be implemented by the sub contract. It additionally stores state variables for challenge number, target, tokens minted, blocks per adjustment, epoch count and statistics for the last minted token block.
* Decoupling from other standards - The original spec was proposed as an extension of ERC20. After some thought and discussion, it made sense to remove this prerequisite as ERC918 should only define 'mineability'. So to create a mineable ERC20, or a mineable ERC721, one only has to use multiple inheritance. (ie. contract AwesomeCoin is ERC20, ERC918 { } )
* Demonstration of a simple mining algorithm for illustration purposes 

Thanks to infernal_toast, mikers, Alex Tsankov and the 0xbitcoin community for pulling together and making this happen.  We went into this knowing that not everyone was philosophically aligned to the idea of mineable tokens, so thanks also to Arachnid and others at Ethereum for candid feedback and ultimately taking a secular, objective, and fair stance on it.

"multi-geth: A go-ethereum client with support of multiple Ethereum networks, including Ethereum Classic","Hi all,

We're developers behind another blockchain project. Recently, we found out that many of our users need to interact with multiple Ethereum networks. However, all of our current geth clients developed by different teams only support one network, and it has been a frustration to use multiple binaries, manage data store folder, etc. What's more, we learned that a lot of new geth features, such as snappy compression, are not available in many of the geth clients because of the difficulty to merge upstream changes.

As a result, we developed `multi-geth`. This is a go-ethereum client forked from Ethereum Foundation's version, aimed to follow closely for upstream changes, and support multiple Ethereum networks. We have just added alpha support for Ethereum Classic network. And we're grateful if the Ethereum Classic community is interested in testing it out!

Our project page is at Github: https://github.com/ellaism/multi-geth

The Ethereum Classic support has not been released yet so you need to build it from source right now. Install golang version 1.10, and run.

    cd multi-geth
    make geth

By default, it connects to Ethereum. To connect to Ethereum Classic, simply pass `--classic` flag, like below:

    ./build/bin/geth --classic

We would appreciate any feedback, bug reports, or pull requests!",25.0,2018-04-02 09:59:53,0.8
[GIT] Weekly Update 8.5,"hey everyone,

it is beautiful Friday evening and here I come with another post. If you didn't follow post form last Sunday, i promised there to do another special post during the upcoming week where I will just focus on new repositories that were introduced on raiden's github. I wanted to leave team with enough time to consolidate their ideas about in what repository they will add what parts of code.


If you ask are the new repositories even needed? Could they just stick with 2 existing ones (I don't count in 2 that never really got some more traction)? Short and dumb answer is **no**.


Correct answer is **yes, definitely**. Few reasons why they really needed to split up code in more repositories are:

* Some important parts of project became so big that they were bringing clutter to the code. By separating those big parts in dedicated repository they make a strict separation of different responsibilities of the code.

* Development is much easier. We see that different team members specialized for different parts (example: loredana for contracts). This way each developer has his playground to work with and they are not stepping on each other's toes. They are still very tedious about code reviews but now they will avoid stacking up pull requests of different features in same place.

* Code reusability. Yes, by doing development this way they can much easier include some features responsible for specific things to new projects. They even created a complete new repository just for that purpose, but more about that in next chapter.


These are just a few reasons from top of my head. I am sure there are many more, so if you remember a good one please share in the comments =).


Next is coverage of each individual repository. I will try to sort them by the complexity to describe from easiest to hardest. So, lets start!


**raiden-libs**


Raiden libs is dedicated repository for code that will most probably be needed in any raiden related project there is or will ever be. Idea behind this repository is to make kick starting a new project much easier.


For example, it specifies a code structure for any new project. Code structure is basically what part of code goes in which folder.


Furthermore, it contains some code that will be needed throughout projects but they can't really find a happy place for it to stand. Different helpers/utils/utilities are what we can expect in this repository.


One last thing I would like to mention that went into this repository is very core list of external libraries they use. Funny part is that this repository uses external library ""eth-utils"" which is basically the same kind of repository, just from Ethereum.


I would like to add that this repository is not really that developed yet. We can expect developers to add new things now and then when they find something small but really useful in different parts of code.


**spec**


I see spec as raiden's white paper. Way the spec was written resembles something you would find in code's documentation and not something that would be published in a journal, but it is far more than that.


Spec contains all the information you need to understand how raiden works. it's size is immense and information they've put in there is far above my knowledge level (which does not stop me from reading it). Every workflow is well described and it is truly raiden's great asset.


Cool part about spec is that it contains description of features that have not yet been developed. Exact implementation of some of those features is still not decided and all that is documented inside a spec.


I see three main purposes of spec. First one is education of anyone interested in a project. Second is ""source of truth"" for anything implemented and not implemented in project. Last one is detailed high level documentation for any party interested in extending the raiden. 


**raiden-pathfinding-service**


Raiden pathfinding service is repository dedicated exclusively to part of raiden project responsible for pathfindig problem. I am planning to do explanation of pathfinding problem in my Sunday post, so don't be worried if you don't really understand it at the moment.


Problems developers will try to solve here are related to finding the fastest and cheapest path between nodes inside the raiden network.


Problems like these are very high level programming and theory behind it is very complex. Usual problems one would encounter when developing something like this is how to make path something goes trough optimal but keep the whole thing lightwate as possible in terms of resource consumption.


Some interesting things are going on inside a project (we can already see MVP milestone is set) but detail coverage of that in Sunday post.


**raiden-monitoring-service**


Monitors will be very important part of raiden. They will be responsible to make raiden fully usable in any situation.


Idea behind them is that they will monitor that nothing fishy is going on with channel while user is not able to, well monitor it for himself. For example if user has no internet connection monitor service will keep an eye on channel for him.


This is really short description and I plan to cover this topic sometimes in the future. I still need to get a better grasp on how exactly they will operate and from what I see even developers don't have a complete spec figured out. So, stay tuned, we will figure this beast out together, but just not at this moment.


**raiden-contracts**


Last but not least are the contracts. Contracts were making clutter in raiden repository for long time and now they finally have the place of their own.


Team removed the pull request ""one contract per token"" from raiden repository and they decided to merge those changes here. Status of that feature will be covered on Sunday (spoiler: I think it is pretty much done).


We can see that they already got more features that they want to implement waiting and I expect this repository to be one of the more active ones.


**conclusion**


So, team basically decided to triple my job =). Just kidding, this split was very needed and I welcome it. I hope you find this mid week post useful and as always, I will give my best to answer any questions. More info and coverage of what exactly happened in last week will come on Sunday! Team is really bringing their A game last couple of weeks and it is pleasure to watch them work =).


PS On Sunday I asked you should I contact Brainbot about community manager position. Since almost all feedback I got was positive, I did and we are currently in contact. I won't share details of the whole process but expect information about end result. Thank you once again for all your positive feedback and comments, they really make me love doing this =).


Cya on Sunday!

A Crypto Investor's Questions About OMG,"Hello all! I am quite a large crypto investor but I do not specialize in the technical side of things. I am beginning my deep dive into OMG and have come up with some initial questions after reading the whitepaper, articles, reddit posts, guides, chat logs, and talking to other crypto analysts. I am generally pretty hesitant to post in an individual project's subreddit for a few reasons:

-The users are biased potentially to the point of full misinformation

-There is oftentimes hostility for criticism or if users believe answers can be found on your own

So I ask you to be as objective and kind as possible while I ask you these questions. If you do not mind, please upvote this post for visibility. Okay here we go. Feel free to answer just what you know or nothing at all if you so choose: 

1. How will OMG be able to transact in Bitcoin? It says the DEX will provide interoperability to all ETH tokens and BTC for a fully on-chain cross-chain exchange. It says OMG will be able to interact with Bitcoin via clearinghouses in state channels or smart contracts. What does that mean and how does it work?

1. The narrative has always been that Omise will move to OMG. Moving Omise to OMG would effectively reduce the value of Omise equity to zero or at the very least massively dilute current shareholders. In what way does this make sense for Omise? 

1. How will the success of OMG help Omise’s payments business grow?

1. On what date will the ""OmiseGo reserve"" (20% of OMG issued), and the ""team reserve"" (9.9% of OMG issued) come into circulation? 

1. Will all of these OMG DEX transactions and withdrawals be taxable events? If so, won’t this essentially destroy OMG’s value?
1. How long is fully functioning Plasma expected to take? To what level have they proven it will actually work? 
1. What if Plasma doesn’t work as planned? Is there a backup option for scalability?

1. Until Plasma is released, will OMG be able to process enough transactions to generate any fees worthwhile? Will it even be able to function with a decent sized user base? 

1. I watched a recent talk (https://www.facebook.com/suss.sg/videos/1174940702643388/ - 12:00 mark) that said Plasma will be able to take Ethereum to a few thousand transactions per second. What evidence is there that OMG will be able to scale to 1M+ tx/s using Plasma? 
1. What does a successful OMG look like? What does the future of transacting, trading, and banking look like for an OMG user several years from now? Walk me through the main ways an average OMG user would be using OMG on a daily basis.

1. Will users be able to access most of their different fiat, crypto, points, and assets all from one wallet or will they have several? I understand some merchants will run OMG in the background and customers won't even know that OMG is being used. But will there be a main wallet where a lot can be accessed from?
1. Why are so many people in southeast Asia unbanked? Why can they not get bank accounts?
1. How will users know what their exchange rate for trading currencies/crypto will be if they are essentially selling at market on the DEX? Or will there be limit orders as well? 

1. Isn’t the whole point of rewards points with companies to keep you hooked on their company? Isn’t part of their strategy hoping you’ll never use those points? What is the incentive for companies to want to merge reward points when now customers won’t have to stick with that company?
1. How does it affect the token economics if stakers can receive rewards in any token, not just OMG?
 
1. Was Sente released? It says scheduled for Q1 2018?

1. What functionality besides staking will be available with the Honte release? What is the timeline for an actual usable product for consumers? 

Thank you for your time. ",95.0,2018-03-08 02:51:25,0.95

Video starts at [[2:57](https://youtu.be/GhUtruRZOlo?t=2m57s)].

## EIP process improvements [[3:59](https://youtu.be/GhUtruRZOlo?t=3m59s)]
- Want a channel where it's easy for people to communicate about what changes they want to happen
- There is a group called Fellowship of Ethereum Magicians (Hudson to post link), self-organizing group to maximize technical opportunities
  - Like IETF for Ethereum, self-organized group of engineers, scientists, technologists who ""keep things running"" - make sure all of our equipment speaks the same protocol, etc.
  - Will do a workshop at EthCC
  - Jamie Pitts, Greg Colvin have organized
- Will Yoichi be a part of the governance process going forward? A chance he will join again in the future.
- Nick: We need to distinguish between writing a standard and adopting it
  - IETF: Consensus is not about majority votes
  - Hard fork is the final option
  - Can we publish things and let people choose whether to support them or not?
  - Firm up the process of what is considered merged, and the technical requirements of EIP editors
  - Make it clear to everyone involved that EIP writing is a technical process, and that if something is merged it does not mean that it will ever be adopted
  - In short, if something is technically well written, it should be merged but may never be adopted
- Greg: we don't have a good way to keep technical issues separate from policy issues
  - It's difficult to move forward with proposals if we're overwhelmed with debate about the wisdom of a proposal before editing, drafting, merging complete
  - There should not be huge debates about whether this EIP should be assigned a number, it should not be so contentious
- [IETF article from Hudson](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-resnick-on-consensus-01)
- Avsa: not merging things until all objections addressed? This is very hard, same objection can be made in different language
  - We could add an obligatory section on every EIP where you list every main objection and address each one somehow
  - In practice it's hard to separate tech proposals from policy proposals as Greg suggested
  - Maybe we should not merge things that we never want to become standards
  - Greg response: things can become a draft, drafts don't have an EIP number. Once it's a draft it can be accepted, deferred, rejected, etc.
- Greg: we need a body where we can have these arguments in a civil, deliberative way; doing this esp. at the pre-draft stage in Github comments is not the right forum
- Tim: NEO voting
  - They have an electoral system
  - Some people verify their addresses and then they have more authority with their votes
- Vitalik: In general I dislike allowing coin votes for anything
  - Random people who happen to have a lot of ETH are not necessarily the people who have strong technical opinions
  - For things that don't pass developer consensus or have tradeoffs, as much as Carbon Votes are problematic, they're one of the least bad mechanisms we have, esp. in combination with other types of community polling
  - But I do also feel that rather than only invoking for very controversial stuff like the DAO fork and issuance reduction, maybe we should use it for everything
  - Carbon Voting has its flaws and should not be a sole signal but it's been used twice, and it's okay to listen to as long as you recognize that it's one of several signals
  - Avsa: 100 people responsible for 80% of the voting power, this is inevitable due to power distribution of tokens and voter apathy
  - Tim: as Ethereum becomes more popular you'll get more random feature requests
  - Vitalik: decision markets are hard because choosing a single objective function is hard--I don't believe it's ETH price
  - We can return to this in 2-3 years if Maker DAO and other projects find that it's working for them
- Vitalik: In general, our governance mechanism is really not that bad, the main flaw is not so much in the mechanism itself but in how we communicate them
  - E.g. re: standardized ETH recovery, the impression that a lot of community members got from the outside is that if it's merged, it's a lot closer to being accepted than anyone involved in the decision-making process intended to signal that it is
  - Hudson: can make this clearer, add a disclaimer: ""Just because this has been merged does not mean it is any closer to being accepted, this is just a draft.""
- Nick: Some people suggest we should not formalize governance because then it will be vulnerability to exploit capture, etc.
  - But I am concerned that not formalizing it could have the same outcome
  - Hudson: We need some degree of formalization, but maybe not too strict, e.g. these calls
  - Vitalik: Agree that having these calls is good, giving relative indications about status of various EIPs, etc., but then just because everyone on the call agrees an EIP is good it should not 100% necessarily be approved
- Avsa: Someone opened an EIP, was probably a joke, can you have one standard negating another? Both can be drafts!

## Constantinople [[32:15](https://youtu.be/GhUtruRZOlo?t=32m15s)]
- On last call, we decided that some EIPs could definitely go in
  - [EIP 145: Bitwise shifting instructions in EVM](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-145.md): pretty well-formed, but not 100% implemented or tested
  - [EIP 210: Blockhash refactoring](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/pull/210) [[32:40](https://youtu.be/GhUtruRZOlo?t=32m40s)]
    - Replace BLOCKHASH opcode, but also has the feature that you can invoke the contract directly to gain access to > last 6 blockhashes
    - Can access any previous block from the current block in the maximum of three merkle hops
    - Difficulty to implement? Vitalik: There is already an implementation in at least a couple of clients, just need to write a bunch of tests for it.
    - Martin: Not that difficult to implement in the client, but is the actual contract code finalized?
    - Paweł: I would like to see the spec finished, but I made some comments/amendments months ago and haven't had an answer. It should be merged as a draft so I can PR to fix some issues.
    - Hudson: Vitalik please make final changes to the EIP and merge it
    - Vitalik: Please look through it again and make sure there are no issues. I'd like someone independent to write some tests for it. Prefer not to merge until the EVM code as written is very very close to final.
    - Paweł: There is at least one bug in the contract. Would be easier if the code is merged so I can send PR rather than just discuss in the comments.
  - [EIP168](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/168), [169](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/169) - Killing dust accounts, replay protection for this [[42:20](https://youtu.be/GhUtruRZOlo?t=42m20s)]
    - [Andrei's graph](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/168#issuecomment-364066940)
    - [Alexey Akhunov data](https://medium.com/@akhounov/more-data-for-eip-168-kill-dust-accounts-83e8dd0938d3)
    - Alexey did some tests, ~1M accounts, roughly less than half the accounts in the state are zero balance
    - Should this go into Constantinople?
    - Vitalik: I'm not concerned about arguments about deleting people's money since this would only delete the account if at the end of a transaction it has less than gas_price x 21,000, can only increase the cost of a transaction by more than a factor of 2-epsilon
    - V: I prefer variant B
    - Nick: if someone sends a tx with a very high gas price they risk losing that amount of gas x 2
    - Martin: we should set a hard limit in the protocol, this would be less risky
    - Casey: unclear how much benefit clearing the dust accounts would have; per Andrei's post, state goes from ~9.6 to ~7.3 gb (~2.3gb savings)
    - Vitalik: state size control is important not just for saving disk size but also reducing fast sync time, also the bigger the state, the less you can keep in memory which makes DoS attacks worse
    - Nick: if we decide not to clean up existing dust accounts but set a rule going forward, we can do the dynamically-adapting thing without risking attacks
    - Hudson: good idea if we can't decide whether savings are worth it for the risk
    - Casey: nonce replay protection scheme might also make it more difficult to do later sharding approaches with nonces and merkle proofs
    - Vitalik: keep in mind that this will not apply to abstracted accounts (if we do account abstraction) anyway since they will all have code
    - If a few years from now the state space is 3x bigger due to abstracted accounts the actual gain here goes down to maybe 7-8%, in which case maybe that development time would be spent on Casper or sharding
    - Vitalik: there are intermediate versions we can consider, e.g., if at some point we upgrade tx formats, it would be a great opportunity, 2-3x simpler to implement a one time account clear of some kind, but this is a longer-term thing
    - Nick: re: EIP169, how do you sign a tx, wouldn't you need to know which block it will be included in?
      - V: an account going from non-existent to existent is not something the owner of an account can do
      - You can only send a tx from an account that already exists
    - Nick: we could do 169 without 168 initially
      - New nonce scheme, gives people a chance to adapt to that
      - In a later fork, implement dust cleanup which requires it
    - Tim: does account abstraction supercede this?
      - Vitalik: account abstraction only applies to new accounts
    - Avsa: people who have moved ETH to WETH would not be affected by this as there is no dust cleaning for tokens
      - Martin: don't think people would mind if dust is cleaned, most of it is probably from people who tried to move all ETH out of an account but didn't use Javascript bigints and didn't get the math exactly right
    - Hudson: no clear agreement on this so let's move on
  - [EIP859: account abstraction](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/859) [[58:42](https://youtu.be/GhUtruRZOlo?t=58m42s)]
    - Last time we agreed to table this and focus on things like Casper
    - Vitalik: This will happen anyway inside sharding, it will exist in some clients in some form; at some point the code will be mostly written but that's still some time away
      - It's a fairly substantial undertaking, esp. because of things like miner strategies
      - So if we try to do it very quickly (in time for next hard fork) we don't get the benefit of piggybacking on work being done on sharding side
      - Personally I would therefore lean towards not putting this into Constantinople
      - Main reason to do this would be some urgency for some particular applications that could take advantage of abstraction, but there may also be simpler kludges to provide it with off-chain protocols
    - Hudson: as discussed last time, too much work for Constantinople but should be reassessed after Constantinople esp. depending where sharding is at that point
  - [EIP232: New tx formats](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/232) [[1:02:18](https://youtu.be/GhUtruRZOlo?t=1h2m18s)]
    - Creates two new types of transactions
    - Vitalik: overview
      - Superset of earlier abstraction proposal
      - Chain ID replay protection against ETC chain
      - We had to do a series of kludges for this
      - This got a bit too complicated
      - The idea was to make a clean, new type of tx where the first number would always be a transaction version number, second value the network ID, then from there it depends on transaction version number
      - Benefit: way more forward compatible
      - Would be convenient to do at the same time as account abstraction, if not adding any new tx types then we're not getting much benefit, whereas if done at the same time, it makes sense because there is an some actual, new tx format
    - Hudson: okay, so this doesn't need to go into Constantinople either
  - Timing [[1:05:44](https://youtu.be/GhUtruRZOlo?t=1h5m44s)]
    - [EIP 145: Bitwise shifting instructions in EVM](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-145.md) - agreed upon
    - [EIP 210: Blockhash refactoring](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/pull/210) - need to work on some more, but going in direction of being approved for the next hard fork
    - Are there other things we want to add? Or should we just continue to focus on casper and sharding?
      - Vitalik: We should consider a substantial reduction in gas costs of curves, ZK-snarks opcodes, this would be a fairly trivial EIP to put into the hard fork
        - Actual numbers are in [benchmarking repo](https://github.com/ethereum/benchmarking)
          - CPP, Geth, Parity covered
          - But not necessarily using the same test vectors in all cases
          - Geth has the most compehensive test benchmarks
        - karalabe: performance is about 18x faster than current implementation, so if we can implement that then gas costs can go down significantly
          - Go was slower of implementations
          - So if we get 16-18x faster how does that compare to other clients?
          - Dmitrii: we do not have these benchmarks for EthereumJ
    - If we can finalize this stuff over next month or so, we can lock in dates for testing Constantinople
      - Also tied to first Casper implementation
      - Would be good for clients to add this to their roadmaps
      
# Test RPC protocol discussion [[1:11:48](https://youtu.be/GhUtruRZOlo?t=1h11m48s)]
  - https://github.com/ethereum/retesteth/issues/4
  - Dimitry: I started to work on this new approach which would allow us to generate consensus test from any client which implements new testrpc method
  - Clients can use this to generate new tests

# EIP648: Easy parallelizability [[1:13:29](https://youtu.be/GhUtruRZOlo?t=1h13m29s)]
  - https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/648
  - Tim: Wondering if you guys think it's important enough to start considering
  - Similar to introducing a new tx type for [EIP232: New transaction formats](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/232)? Not quite
  - Vitalik: New tx type is cosmetic whereas parallelizability requires changes to protocol guarantees and architecture
    - Pretty sure this could open us up to call stack depth attacks
    - Deep changes are the parts that include actually parallelizing contract execution
    - It's totally fine for people to try implementing but I'm curious realistically how you would test this and what info you would get from the test
  - Tim: I'm also wondering, which client would be good for making a branch for this
  - Vitalik: Use a pretty simple algorithm to retroactively assign lists to previous tx
    - Try to run in parallel and see what the speed up is
    - Call stack depth attack: when an attacker creates a tx which calls a contract, which calls itself a bunch of times and then calls a target contract, but when the target tries to call out to something else it fails because call stack depth too high
      - In current parallelizability proposals a contract has to specify a list of addresses it can call, any attempt to go outside that range leads to an immediate exception
      - So it also lets you make a tx which calls some contract, if it will call another contract then the second degree call could be outside the access list so it would fail
      - Casey: so if a contract assumes its calls always succeed, that would be the vulnerability
      - V: You cannot assume a call succeeds and need to handle the case where it fails
      - We did come up with a bunch of other countermeasures before fixing this issue
  - Hudson: need to explore this more before the next core devs meeting
  - Martin: parallelizability definitely will not go into Constantinople since it requires large changes
  - Casey: until we know bottleneck about disk I/O and how to optimize it, this EIP doesn't make it possible to increase block gas limit without some of the other disk I/O optimizations that are being explored with e.g. TurboGeth
    - TurboGeth disk I/O optimizations are therefore the most important things to work on prior to this EIP
  - Hudson: Not going into Constantinople

My brief observation of most common Consensus Algorithms,"I have studied most common consensus algorithms. Here is the summary, maybe for someone it will be helpful. My goal is to describe every specific consensus briefly so everyone can easily understand it. *Please let me know if I have wrote something wrong, or maybe you are aware of interesting algorithm, I have missed.

[Proof of Work] - very short, cuz it's well-known.

[1] Bitcoin - to generate a new block miner must generate hash of the new block header that is in line with given requirements.

Others: Ethereum, Litecoin etc.

[Hybrid of PoW and PoS]

[2] Decred - hybrid of “proof of work” and “proof of stake”. Blocks are created about every 5 minutes. Nodes in the network looking for a solution with a known difficulty to create a block (PoW). Once the solution is found it is broadcast to the network. The network then verifies the solution. Stakeholders who have locked some DCR in return for a ticket* now have the chance to vote on the block (PoS). 5 tickets are chosen pseudo-randomly from the ticket pool and if at least 3 of 5 vote ‘yes’ the block is permanently added to the blockchain. Both miners and voters are compensated with DCR : PoS - 30% and PoW - 60% of about 30 new Decred issued with a block. * 1 ticket = ability to cast 1 vote. Stakeholders must wait an average of 28 days (8,192 blocks) to vote their tickets. 

[Proof of Stake]

[3] Nxt - The more tokens are held by account, the greater chance that account will earn the right to generate a block. The total reward received as a result of block generation is the sum of the transaction fees located within the block. Three values are key to determining which account is eligible to generate a block, which account earns the right to generate a block, and which block is taken to be the authoritative one in times of conflict: base target value, target value and cumulative difficulty. Each block on the chain has a generation signature parameter. To participate in the block's forging process, an active account digitally signs the generation signature of the previous block with its own public key. This creates a 64-byte signature, which is then hashed using SHA256. The first 8 bytes of the resulting hash are converted to a number, referred to as the account hit. The hit is compared to the current target value(active balance). If the computed hit is lower than the target, then the next block can be generated.

[4] Peercoin (chain-based proof of stake) - coin age parameter. Hybrid PoW and PoS algorithm. The longer your Peercoins have been stationary in your account (to a maximum of 90 days), the more power (coin age) they have to mint a block. The act of minting a block requires the consumption of coin age value, and the network determines consensus by selecting the chain with the largest total consumed coin age. Reward - minting + 1% yearly.

[5] Reddcoin (Proof of stake Velocity) - quite similar to Peercoin, difference: not linear coin-aging function (new coins gain weight quickly, and old coins gain weight increasingly slowly) to encourage Nodes Activity. Node with most coin age weight have a bigger chance to create block. To create block Node should calculate right hash. Block reward - interest on the weighted age of coins/ 5% annual interest in PoSV phase.

[6] Ethereum (Casper) - uses modified BFT consensus. Blocks will be created using PoW. In the Casper Phase 1 implementation for Ethereum, the “proposal mechanism"" is the existing proof of work chain, modified to have a greatly reduced block reward. Blocks will be validated by set of Validators. Block is finalised when 2/3 of validators voted for it (not the number of validators is counted, but their deposit size). Block creator rewarded with Block Reward + Transaction FEES.

[7] Lisk (Delegated Proof-of-stake) - Lisk stakeholders vote with vote transaction (the weight of the vote depends on the amount of Lisk the stakeholder possess) and choose 101 Delegates, who create all blocks in the blockchain. One delegate creates 1 block within 1 round (1 round contains 101 blocks) -> At the beginning of each round, each delegate is assigned a slot indicating their position in the block generation process -> Delegate includes up to 25 transactions into the block, signs it and broadcasts it to the network -> As >51% of available peers agreed that this block is acceptable to be created (Broadhash consensus), a new block is added to the blockchain. *Any account may become a delegate, but only accounts with the required stake (no info how much) are allowed to generate blocks. Block reward - minted Lisks and transaction fees (fees for all 101 blocks are collected firstly and then are divided between delegates). Blocks appears every 10 sec.

[8] Cardano (Ouroboros Proof of Stake) - Blocks(slots) are created by Slot Leaders. Slot Leaders for N Epoch are chosen during n-1 Epoch. Slot Leaders are elected from the group of ADA stakeholders who have enough stake. Election process consist of 3 phases: Commitment phase: each elector generates a random value (secret), signs it and commit as message to network (other electors) saved in to block. -> Reveal phase: Each elector sends special value to open a commitment, all this values (opening) are put into the block. -> Recovery phase: each elector verifies that commitments and openings match and extracts the secrets and forms a SEED (randomly generated bytes string based on secrets). All electors get the same SEED. -> Follow the Satoshi algorithm : Elector who have coin which corresponded to SEED become a SLOT LEADER and get a right to create a block. Slot Leader is rewarded with minted ADA and transactions Fee.

[9] Tezos (Proof Of Stake) - generic and self-amending crypto-ledger. At the beginning of each cycle (2048 blocks), a random seed is derived from numbers that block miners chose and committed to in the penultimate cycle, and revealed in the last. -> Using this random seed, a follow the coin strategy (similar to Follow The Satoshi) is used to allocate mining rights and signing rights to stakeholders for the next cycle*. -> Blocks are mined by a random stakeholder (the miner) and includes multiple signatures of the previous block provided by random stakeholders (the signers). 
Mining and signing both offer a small reward but also require making a one cycle safety deposit to be forfeited in the event of a double mining or double signing.
* the more coins (rolls) you have - the more your chance to be a miner/signer.

[10] Tendermint (Byzantine Fault Tolerance) - A proposal is signed and published by the designated proposer at each round. The proposer is chosen by a deterministic and non-choking round robin selection algorithm that selects proposers in proportion to their voting power. The proposer create the block, that should be validated by >2/3 of Validators, as follow: Propose -> Prevote -> Precommit -> Commit. Proposer rewarded with Transaction FEES.

[11] Tron (Byzantine Fault Tolerance) - This blockhain is still on development stage. Consensus algorithm = PoS + BFT (similar to Tendermint): PoS algorithm chooses a node as Proposer, this node has the power to generate a block. -> Proposer broadcasts a block that it want to release. -> Block enters the Prevote stage. It takes >2/3 of nodes' confirmations to enter the next stage. -> As the block is prevoted, it enters Precommit stage and needs >2/3 of node's confirmation to go further. -> As >2/3 of nodes have precommited the block it's commited to the blockchain with height +1. New blocks appears every 15 sec.

[12] NEO (Delegated Byzantine Fault Tolerance) - Consensus nodes* are elected by NEO holders -> The Speaker is identified (based on algorithm) -> He broadcasts proposal to create block -> Each Delegate (other consensus nodes) validates proposal -> Each Delegate sends response to other Delegates -> Delegate reaches consensus after receiving 2/3 positive responses -> Each Delegate signs the block and publishes it-> Each Delegate receives a full block. Block reward 6 GAS distributed proportionally in accordance with the NEO holding ratio among NEO holders. Speaker rewarded with transaction fees (mostly 0). * Stake 1000 GAS to nominate yourself for Bookkeeping(Consensus Node)

[13] EOS (Delegated Proof of Stake) - those who hold tokens on a blockchain adopting the EOS.IO software may select* block producers through a continuous approval voting system and anyone may choose to participate in block production and will be given an opportunity to produce blocks proportional to the total votes they have received relative to all other producers. At the start of each round 21 unique block producers are chosen. The top 20 by total approval are automatically chosen every round and the last producer is chosen proportional to their number of votes relative to other producers. Block should be confirmed by 2/3 or more of elected Block producers. Block Producer rewarded with Block rewards. *the more EOS tokens a stakeholder owns, the greater their voting power

[The XRP Ledger Consensus Process]

[14] Ripple - Each node receives transaction from external applications -> Each Node forms public list of all valid (not included into last ledger (=block)) transactions aka (Candidate Set) -> Nodes merge its candidate set with UNLs(Unique Node List) candidate sets and vote on the veracity of all transactions (1st round of consensus) -> all transactions that received at least 50% votes are passed on the next round (many rounds may take place) -> final round of consensus requires that min 80% of Nodes UNL agreeing on transactions. It means that at least 80% of Validating nodes should have same Candidate SET of transactions -> after that each Validating node computes a new ledger (=block) with all transactions (with 80% UNL agreement) and calculate ledger hash, signs and broadcasts -> All Validating nodes compare their ledgers hash -> Nodes of the network recognize a ledger instance as validated when a 80% of the peers have signed and broadcast the same validation hash. -> Process repeats. Ledger creation process lasts 5 sec(?). Each transaction includes transaction fee (min 0,00001 XRP) which is destroyed. No block rewards.

[The Stellar consensus protocol]

[15] Stellar (Federated Byzantine Agreement) - quit similar to Ripple. Key difference - quorum slice.

[Proof of Burn]

[16] Slimcoin - to get the right to write blocks Node should “burn” amount of coins. The more coins Node “burns” more chances it has to create blocks (for long period) -> Nodes address gets a score called Effective Burnt Coins that determines chance to find blocks. Block creator rewarded with block rewards.

[Proof of Importance]

[17] NEM - Only accounts that have min 10k vested coins are eligible to harvest (create a block). Accounts with higher importance scores have higher probabilities of harvesting a block. The higher amount of vested coins, the higher the account’s Importance score. And the higher amount of transactions that satisfy following conditions: - transactions sum min 1k coins, - transactions made within last 30 days, - recipient have 10k vested coins too, - the higher account’s Important score. Harvester is rewarded with fees for the transactions in the block. A new block is created approx. every 65 sec.

[Proof of Devotion]

[18] Nebulas (Proof of Devotion + BFT) - quite similar to POI, the PoD selects the accounts with high influence.  All accounts are ranked according to their liquidity and propagation (Nebulas Rank) -> Top-ranked accounts are selected -> Chosen accounts pay deposit and are qualified as the blocks Validators* -> Algorithm pseudo-randomly chooses block Proposer -> After a new block is proposed, Validators Set (each Validator is charged a deposit) participate in a round of BFT-Style voting to verify block (1. Prepare stage -> 2. Commit Stage. Validators should have > 2/3 of total deposits to validate Block) -> Block is added. Block rewards : each Validator rewarded with 1 NAS.
*Validators Set is dynamic, changes in Set may occur after Epoch change. 

[IOTA Algorithm]

[19] IOTA - uses DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph) instead of blockchain (TANGLE equal to Ledger). Graph consist of transactions (not blocks). To issue a new transaction Node must approve 2 random other Transactions (not confirmed). Each transaction should be validate n(?) times. By validating PAST(2) transactions whole Network achieves Consensus. in Order to issue transaction Node: 1. Sign transaction with private key 2. choose two other Transactions to validate based on MCMC(Markov chain Monte Carlo) algorithm, check if 2 transactions are valid (node will never approve conflicting transactions) 3. make some PoW(similar to HashCash). -> New Transaction broadcasted to Network. Node don’t receive reward or fee.

[PBFT + PoW]

[20] Yobicash - uses PBFT and also PoW. Nodes reach consensus on transactions by querying other nodes. A node asks its peers about the state of a transaction: if it is known or not, and if it is a doublespending transaction or not. As follow : Node receives new transaction -> Checks if valid -> queries all known nodes for missing transactions (check if already in DAG ) -> queries 2/3 nodes for doublepsending and possibility -> if everything is ok add to DAG. Reward - nodes receive transaction fees + minting coins. 

[Proof of Space/Proof of Capacity]

[21] Filecoin (Power Fault Tolerance) - the probability that the network elects a miner(Leader) to create a new block (it is referred to as the voting power of the miner) is proportional to storage currently in use in relation to the rest of the network. Each node has Power - storage in use verified with Proof of Spacetime by nodes. Leaders extend the chain by creating a block and propagating it to the network. There can be an empty block (when no leader). A block is committed if the majority of the participants add their weight on the chain where the block belongs to, by extending the chain or by signing blocks. Block creator rewarded with Block reward + transaction fees.

[Proof of Elapsed Time]

[22] Hyperledger Sawtooth - Goal - to solve BFT Validating Nodes limitation. Works only with intel’s SGX. PoET uses a random leader election model or a lottery based election model based on SGX, where the protocol randomly selects the next leader to finalize the block. Every validator requests a wait time from an enclave (a trusted function). -> The validator with the shortest wait time for a particular transaction block is elected the leader. -> The BlockPublisher is responsible for creating candidate blocks to extend the current chain. He takes direction from the consensus algorithm for when to create a block and when to publish a block. He creates, Finalizes, Signs Block and broadcast it -> Block Validators check block -> Block is created on top of blockchain. 

[Other]

[23] Byteball (Delegated Byzantine Fault Tolerance) - only verified nodes are allowed to be Validation nodes (list of requirements https://github.com/byteball/byteball-witness). Users choose in transaction set of 12 Validating nodes. Validating nodes(Witnesses) receive transaction fees.   

[24] Nano - uses DAG, PoW (HashCash). Nano uses a block-lattice structure. Each account has its own blockchain (account-chain) equivalent to the account’s transaction/balance history. To add transaction user should make some HashCash PoW -> When user creates transaction Send Block appears on his blockchain and Receive block appears on Recipients blockchain. -> Peers in View receive Block -> Peers verify block (Double spending and check if already in the ledger) -> Peers achieve consensus and add block.
In case of Fork (when 2 or more signed blocks reference the same previous block):  Nano network resolves forks via a  balance-weighted voting system where representative nodes vote for the block they observe, as >50% of weighted votes received, consensus achieved and block is retained in the Node’s ledger (block that lose the vote is discarded). 

[25] Holochain - uses distributed hash table (DHT). Instead of trying to manage global consensus for every change to a huge blockchain ledger, every participant has their own signed hash chain. In case of multi-party transaction, it is signed to each party's chain. Each party signs the exact same transaction with links to each of their previous chain entries. After data is signed to local chains, it is shared to a DHT where every neighbor node validate it.
Any consensus algorithms can be built on top of Holochain.

[26] Komodo ('Delegated' Delayed Proof of Work (dPoW)) - end-to-end blockchain solutions. DPoW consensus mechanism does not recognize The Longest Chain Rule to resolve a conflict in the network, instead the dPoW looks to backups it inserted previously into the chosen PoW blockchain. The process of inserting backups of Komodo transactions into a secure PoW is “notarization.” Notarisation is performed by the elected Notary nodes. Roughly every ten minutes, the Notary nodes perform a special block hash mined on the Komodo blockchain and take note of the overall Komodo blockchain “height”. The notary nodes process this specifc block so that their signatures are cryptographically included within the content of the notarized data. There are sixty-four “Notary nodes” elected by a stake-weighted vote, where ownership of KMD represents stake in the election. They are a special type of blockchain miner, having certain features in their underlying code that enable them to maintain an effective and cost-efcient blockchain and they periodically receives the privilege to mine a block on “easy difculty.”

My brief observation of most common Consensus Algorithms,"I have studied most common consensus algorithms. Here is the summary, maybe for someone it will be helpful. My goal is to describe every specific consensus briefly so everyone can easily understand it. *Please let me know if I have wrote something wrong, or maybe you are aware of interesting algorithm, I have missed.

Proof of Work - very short, cuz it's well-known.

Bitcoin - to generate a new block miner must generate hash of the new block header that is in line with given requirements.

Others: Ethereum, Litecoin etc.

Proof of Stake

Nxt- The more tokens are held by account, the greater chance that account will earn the right to generate a block. The total reward received as a result of block generation is the sum of the transaction fees located within the block.
Three values are key to determining which account is eligible to generate a block, which account earns the right to generate a block, and which block is taken to be the authoritative one in times of conflict: base target value, target value and cumulative difficulty. Each block on the chain has a generation signature parameter. To participate in the block's forging process, an active account digitally signs the generation signature of the previous block with its own public key. This creates a 64-byte signature, which is then hashed using SHA256. The first 8 bytes of the resulting hash are converted to a number, referred to as the account hit. The hit is compared to the current target value(active balance). If the computed hit is lower than the target, then the next block can be generated.

Peercoin (chain-based proof of stake) - coin age parameter. Hybrid PoW and PoS algorithm. The longer your Peercoins have been stationary in your account (to a maximum of 90 days), the more power (coin age) they have to mint a block. The act of minting a block requires the consumption of coin age value, and the network determines consensus by selecting the chain with the largest total consumed coin age. Reward - minting + 1% yearly.

Reddcoin (Proof of stake Velocity) - quite similar to Peercoin, difference: not linear coin-aging function (new coins gain weight quickly, and old coins gain weight increasingly slowly) to encourage Nodes Activity. Node with most coin age weight have a bigger chance to create block. To create block Node should calculate right hash. Block reward - interest on the weighted age of coins/ 5% annual interest in PoSV phase.

Ethereum (Casper) - uses modified BFT consensus. Blocks will be created using PoW. In the Casper Phase 1 implementation for Ethereum, the “proposal mechanism"" is the existing proof of work chain, modified to have a greatly reduced block reward. Blocks will be validated by set of Validators. Block is finalised when 2/3 of validators voted for it (not the number of validators is counted, but their deposit size). Block creator rewarded with Block Reward + Transaction FEES.

Lisk (Delegated Proof-of-stake) - Lisk stakeholders vote with vote transaction (the weight of the vote depends on the amount of Lisk the stakeholder possess) and choose 101 Delegates, who create all blocks in the blockchain. One delegate creates 1 block within 1 round (1 round contains 101 blocks) -> At the beginning of each round, each delegate is assigned a slot indicating their position in the block generation process -> Delegate includes up to 25 transactions into the block, signs it and broadcasts it to the network -> As >51% of available peers agreed that this block is acceptable to be created (Broadhash consensus), a new block is added to the blockchain. *Any account may become a delegate, but only accounts with the required stake (no info how much) are allowed to generate blocks. Block reward - minted Lisks and transaction fees (fees for all 101 blocks are collected firstly and then are divided between delegates). Blocks appears every 10 sec.

Cardano (Ouroboros Proof of Stake) - Blocks(slots) are created by Slot Leaders. Slot Leaders for N Epoch are chosen during n-1 Epoch. Slot Leaders are elected from the group of ADA stakeholders who have enough stake. Election process consist of 3 phases: Commitment phase: each elector generates a random value (secret), signs it and commit as message to network (other electors) saved in to block. -> Reveal phase: Each elector sends special value to open a commitment, all this values (opening) are put into the block. -> Recovery phase: each elector verifies that commitments and openings match and extracts the secrets and forms a SEED (randomly generated bytes string based on secrets). All electors get the same SEED. -> Follow the Satoshi algorithm : Elector who have coin which corresponded to SEED become a SLOT LEADER and get a right to create a block. Slot Leader is rewarded with minted ADA and transactions Fee.

Tendermint (Byzantine Fault Tolerance) - A proposal is signed and published by the designated proposer at each round. The proposer is chosen by a deterministic and non-choking round robin selection algorithm that selects proposers in proportion to their voting power. The proposer create the block, that should be validated by >2/3 of Validators, as follow: Propose -> Prevote -> Precommit -> Commit. Proposer rewarded with Transaction FEES.

Tron (Byzantine Fault Tolerance) - This blockhain is still on development stage. Consensus algorithm = PoS + BFT (similar to Tendermint): PoS algorithm chooses a node as Proposer, this node has the power to generate a block. -> Proposer broadcasts a block that it want to release. -> Block enters the Prevote stage. It takes >2/3 of nodes' confirmations to enter the next stage. -> As the block is prevoted, it enters Precommit stage and needs >2/3 of node's confirmation to go further. -> As >2/3 of nodes have precommited the block it's commited to the blockchain with height +1. New blocks appears every 15 sec.

NEO (Delegated Byzantine Fault Tolerance) - Consensus nodes* are elected by NEO holders -> The Speaker is identified (based on algorithm) -> He broadcasts proposal to create block -> Each Delegate (other consensus nodes) validates proposal -> Each Delegate sends response to other Delegates -> Delegate reaches consensus after receiving 2/3 positive responses -> Each Delegate signs the block and publishes it-> Each Delegate receives a full block. Block reward 6 GAS distributed proportionally in accordance with the NEO holding ratio among NEO holders. Speaker rewarded with transaction fees (mostly 0). * Stake 1000 GAS to nominate yourself for Bookkeeping(Consensus Node)

EOS (Delegated Proof of Stake) - those who hold tokens on a blockchain adopting the EOS.IO software may select* block producers through a continuous approval voting system and anyone may choose to participate in block production and will be given an opportunity to produce blocks proportional to the total votes they have received relative to all other producers. At the start of each round 21 unique block producers are chosen. The top 20 by total approval are automatically chosen every round and the last producer is chosen proportional to their number of votes relative to other producers. Block should be confirmed by 2/3 or more of elected Block producers. Block Producer rewarded with Block rewards. *the more EOS tokens a stakeholder owns, the greater their voting power

The XRP Ledger Consensus Process

Ripple - Each node receives transaction from external applications -> Each Node forms public list of all valid (not included into last ledger (=block)) transactions aka (Candidate Set) -> Nodes merge its candidate set with UNLs(Unique Node List) candidate sets and vote on the veracity of all transactions (1st round of consensus) -> all transactions that received at least 50% votes are passed on the next round (many rounds may take place) -> final round of consensus requires that min 80% of Nodes UNL agreeing on transactions. It means that at least 80% of Validating nodes should have same Candidate SET of transactions -> after that each Validating node computes a new ledger (=block) with all transactions (with 80% UNL agreement) and calculate ledger hash, signs and broadcasts -> All Validating nodes compare their ledgers hash -> Nodes of the network recognize a ledger instance as validated when a 80% of the peers have signed and broadcast the same validation hash. -> Process repeats. Ledger creation process lasts 5 sec(?). Each transaction includes transaction fee (min 0,00001 XRP) which is destroyed. No block rewards.

The Stellar consensus protocol

Stellar (Federated Byzantine Agreement) - quit similar to Ripple. Key difference - quorum slice.

Proof of Burn

Slimcoin - to get the right to write blocks Node should “burn” amount of coins. The more coins Node “burns” more chances it has to create blocks (for long period) -> Nodes address gets a score called Effective Burnt Coins that determines chance to find blocks. Block creator rewarded with block rewards.

Proof of Importance

NEM - Only accounts that have min 10k vested coins are eligible to harvest (create a block). Accounts with higher importance scores have higher probabilities of harvesting a block. The higher amount of vested coins, the higher the account’s Importance score. And the higher amount of transactions that satisfy following conditions: - transactions sum min 1k coins, - transactions made within last 30 days, - recipient have 10k vested coins too, - the higher account’s Important score. Harvester is rewarded with fees for the transactions in the block. A new block is created approx. every 65 sec.

IOTA Algorithm

IOTA - uses DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph) instead of blockchain (TANGLE equal to Ledger). Graph consist of transactions (not blocks). To issue a new transaction Node must approve 2 random other Transactions (not confirmed). Each transaction should be validate n(?) times. By validating PAST(2) transactions whole Network achieves Consensus. in Order to issue transaction Node: 1. Sign transaction with private key 2. choose two other Transactions to validate based on MCMC(Markov chain Monte Carlo) algorithm, check if 2 transactions are valid (node will never approve conflicting transactions) 3. make some PoW(similar to HashCash). -> New Transaction broadcasted to Network. Node don’t receive reward or fee.

Proof of Space/Proof of Capacity

Filecoin (Power Fault Tolerance) - the probability that the network elects a miner(Leader) to create a new block (it is referred to as the voting power of the miner) is proportional to storage currently in use in relation to the rest of the network. Each node has Power - storage in use verified with Proof of Spacetime by nodes. Leaders extend the chain by creating a block and propagating it to the network. There can be an empty block (when no leader). A block is committed if the majority of the participants add their weight on the chain where the block belongs to, by extending the chain or by signing blocks. Block creator rewarded with Block reward + transaction fees.

Proof of Elapsed Time

Hyperledger Sawtooth - Goal - to solve BFT Validating Nodes limitation. Works only with intel’s SGX. PoET uses a random leader election model or a lottery based election model based on SGX, where the protocol randomly selects the next leader to finalize the block. Every validator requests a wait time from an enclave (a trusted function). -> The validator with the shortest wait time for a particular transaction block is elected the leader. -> The BlockPublisher is responsible for creating candidate blocks to extend the current chain.

# Notes
Video starts at [4:03](https://youtu.be/1GulA7iA-O0?t=243)

## [[6:05](https://youtu.be/1GulA7iA-O0?t=365)] 1. Testing Updates

### a. Fuzzer updates
Go and Rust clients can work with it and Guido is working on integrating cpp-ethereum. Guido is also working on a bignum fuzzer to make sure bignum libraries are aligned across the clients. Smart contract fuzzing has been discussed, as has fuzzing the network stack, but it has not started yet.

### [[8:56](https://youtu.be/1GulA7iA-O0?t=536)]  b. [New transaction tests folder structure.](https://github.com/ethereum/tests/tree/gentransact/TransactionTests)
There have been changes to the transaction tests to help organize it better and be more representative of the different categories. More technical detail in the call.

## [[11:00](https://youtu.be/1GulA7iA-O0?t=660)] 2. [Shall we require CC0 notices in EIPs?](https://github.com/ethereum/pm/issues/27#issuecomment-348181284)
We agreed that the requirement for CC0 notice should be made going forward. Yoichi made a pull request on EIP 1 to change that. Existing EIPs that do not have the copyright will need to change and we can create PRs for them that they just have to give written permission to change.

## [[35:10](https://youtu.be/1GulA7iA-O0?t=2110)] 3. New Project: JSON RPC Proxy / eth-agent
  a. Discussion: https://github.com/ethereum/cpp-ethereum/issues/4563
  b. Proof of Concept: https://github.com/chfast/json-rpc-proxy/releases/tag/v0.1.0a1
cpp-ethereum components are being separated into separate projects. Components that are not required to run an Ethereum node may be split from the core cpp-ethereum code. The first component to be split off are the HTTP server that is in the client. The JSON RPC proxy can sign transactions for you which acts like an account management component in a way. An update to EthStats which moves it to the shared tooling projects may also be in the works soon.

Separating the account management from the client will help lessen the security overhead of the Ethereum node operators. geth is planning on slowly moving away from account management and Martin is working on an account management tool with a public API that doesn't take passwords. It instead requires interaction with a custom UI and sending remote transactions to the tool.

## [[14:56](https://youtu.be/1GulA7iA-O0?t=896)] 4. [Does it remain the case that the Yellow Paper is intended to be Ethereum's formal specification?](https://github.com/ethereum/pm/issues/27#issuecomment-347997598)
Ben brought up some questions (linked in the title) about the future of the Yellow Paper and it's place as the official specification for clients.

Ben's questions:
> Question: does it remain the case that the YP is intended to be Ethereum's formal specification?
> 
> If yes, then it should be noted that the YP is currently significantly out of date.
> 
> a. What is the plan for bringing the YP up to date post-Byzantium?
> 
> b. What is the process and ownership for maintaining the YP going forward?
> 
> c. Should updating the YP be made part of the EIP finalization process?
> 
> d. To facilitate c., Should EIPs be required to include a pull request to the Yellow Paper (if relevant) before they are accepted?
> 
> e. When consensus failures are discovered (e.g. during the recent fuzz testing), how can we make sure that the YP is updated where necessary?
> 
> If no,
> 
> a. What replaces the YP as the authoritative specification of Ethereum?
> 
> b. Is the YP worth maintaining as a resource that is descriptive rather than prescriptive? If so, the questions above still stand.

Having changes to the Yellow Paper or other formal spec. be merged before certain EIPs are accepted is a good idea.

Gavin Wood maintains the [Yellow Paper](https://github.com/ethereum/yellowpaper) and there are a list of contributors to the Yellow Paper on GitHub. The Yellow Paper doesn't have a copyright which opens up some confusing legal issues for those wanting to fork the Yellow Paper or make unofficial changes that are not merged by Gav. Biggest concern is it is unclear who can legally merge pull requests without legal concerns being attached. There are currently pull requests for the Yellow Paper to bring it up to date.
The Yellow Paper isn't a complete specification of everything needed to build a client and some expressed opinions that the Yellow Paper is difficult to read. [KEVM](https://github.com/kframework/evm-semantics) is a formal specification written in K that can be execute test cases that may be a candidate to replace the Yellow Paper. KEVM is licensed under UIUC/NCSA License. Afri is going to reach out to Gavin to ask about updating and licensing the Yellow Paper include him in this conversation.

Piper suggested having a developer grant for a group that keeps the Yellow Paper or other formal spec. up to date. Currently Dev Grants (Ethereum Foundation grants program) is not active, but may be active in the future.

## [[43:24](https://youtu.be/1GulA7iA-O0?t=2604)] 5. POA Testnet unification [Update]
No updates.

## [[43:51](https://youtu.be/1GulA7iA-O0?t=2631)] 6. Core team updates.
- Parity - Working on release 1.5. No major new features. Mostly working on stabilizing stuff. Improvements on database layer are also happening, specifically replacing the database layer with a new type of database. They are working on Parity multi-sig issue and preparing a list of different approaches on how we can address the problem. They will present a list of proposals at the next core dev meeting. ""We will discuss them with the community and see where it goes from there.""
- geth - New release with no major changes. Working on improving the block tracing.
- cpp-ethereum - Still is post-Mexico mode from Devcon3. Mostly cleaning up some stuff from the Byzantium hard fork. Yoichi has been going through and updating EIPs. Discussion is ongoing with Pawel and Andrei about a roadmap for features. Dimitry has been updating the testing framework. Shout out to Martin H.S, cdetrio, Guido, and other who are contributing to the fuzzer framework
- Harmony - Migrated client to RocksDB. Work is basically complete on making Harmony compatible.
- ethereum-js - No updates.
- pyEVM - Big GitHub migration from Piper's GitHub to Ethereum Foundation's GitHub. Repos have been re-named to make it more clear what each one does. Pretty far along with implementing the light client protocol. Early alpha release of the client (currently called Trinity) expected in the next month. Integration with Hive and JSON-RPC specs are still left to do. The research team is working on moving their Casper implementation to pyEVM.
- pyethapp - There is Casper research testnet utilizing pyethereum.
- EWASM - Roadmap has been created. Aim to launch a preliminary testnet by the end of January.
- Solidity - Release made the day before that had some improvements including fully implemented ABI encoding/decoding (will require specifying experimental release in the header). Really focusing on the SMT solver in Solidity for the next release.

Martin H.S mentioned that there is someone working on a C# Ethereum client that is passing almost all state tests and VM tests. Estimates are that it will be complete in a couple of months. At this point it is still in a private repository, but if people want to help out reach out to Martin and he will connect you.

# Notes
Video starts at [[00:03](https://youtu.be/naPA7tjrgsk?t=3)].

## [[00:33](https://youtu.be/naPA7tjrgsk?t=33)] & [[22:37](https://youtu.be/naPA7tjrgsk?t=1357)] 1. Testing Updates
Yoichi is doing some clean-up of Byzantium test cases. Dimitry is currently working on changing the test source format into YAML. Final tests will still be JSON, this only affects the test source. Those who write tests can use YAML and use multi-line contract source code and write comments.

## [[1:12](https://youtu.be/naPA7tjrgsk?t=72)] 2. Digital cats caused network congestion this month. Meow.

### [[1:22](https://youtu.be/naPA7tjrgsk?t=82)] a. Why did this happen and what solutions are available to prevent future network congestion? See comments below for some ideas.
The gas limit was 6.7 million and crypto kitties used 1-2 million gas per block worth of demand. Usage pushed the transaction fees higher due to demand. Miners upped the gas limit a bit, but usage has grown even more and we are now at an 8 million gas limit and blocks are basically full.

### [[2:20](https://youtu.be/naPA7tjrgsk?t=140)] b. [Stateless Clients proposal](https://github.com/ethereum/pm/issues/28#issuecomment-349676284).
[Alexey Akhunov](https://github.com/AlexeyAkhunov) [described a stateless protocol design](https://medium.com/@akhounov/how-to-speed-up-ethereum-in-the-face-of-crypto-kitties-7a9c901d98e9). Vitalik has [been pushing the stateless protocol paradigm](https://medium.com/@VitalikButerin/regarding-bandwidth-requirements-for-stateless-clients-i-can-give-some-precise-numbers-be357fb69b6d) a lot because it is the direction they are looking at for sharding research. Stateless clients means that instead of the client storing the entire state the client would just store the state root and it would be the responsibility of the miners or transaction senders to package up with the block or the transaction the witness blocks. Witness blocks contain merkle branches that prove that all of the parts of the state required for processing all transactions in that block, and computing the next state root. Although this is theoretically viable, it would require a lot of substantial changes to gas costs and other factors [described here](https://medium.com/@VitalikButerin/regarding-bandwidth-requirements-for-stateless-clients-i-can-give-some-precise-numbers-be357fb69b6d). Other optimizations include the making it so we can access Patricia tree nodes in parallel and bumping cache sizes.
Low effort scaling solutions could potentially be included in Constantinople.

A complete discussion on these issues is [included here](https://github.com/ethereum/pm/issues/28).

### c. [Would having minimum system requirements to set up an optimal client/full node help?](https://github.com/ethereum/pm/issues/28#issuecomment-351141485).
Discussed tangentially in subsection b.

### [[24:12](https://youtu.be/naPA7tjrgsk?t=1452)] d. [Is the bottleneck is not just disk bandwidth, but specifically sequential disk bandwidth? ](https://github.com/ethereum/pm/issues/28#issuecomment-351350231).
Vitalik asks: Are random SSD reads parallizable? Would it take less time to perform 20 random reads than doing a single read? This may help with optimization to do multiple tree reads in parallel. Although it is not fully clear, it appears to be faster, but does it help with DBs like LevelDB? In theory it is likely fast, but in practice it depends on the DB and things like pre-loading the data into a cache or performing computations while pre-loading the data. In geth it may not make a difference because of the way LevelDB works. [Alexey Akhunov volunteered to do some benchmarks to answer some of these questions](https://github.com/ethereum/pm/issues/28#issuecomment-352021812).

### [[31:07](https://youtu.be/naPA7tjrgsk?t=1867)] e. [Vitalik has some ideas around gas cost changes and scalability-relevant client optimizations.](https://github.com/ethereum/pm/issues/28#issuecomment-350941632)
Main point: Vitalik thinks state reads are underpriced and pointed out some other scalability improvements that are quick wins.

> 1. Increase the price of blockchain reads.
> 2. [EIP 648: Parallelization](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/648).
> 3. Two account destroying/dust clearing EIPs ([168](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/168)/[169](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/169)).

Martin HS wondered what the impact of increasing price on blockchain reads would have on the amount of gas used per block and fill up blocks more quickly. Vitalik says that he thinks the purpose of re-pricing is to improve the worst case rather than the average case. We still need to encourage devs to write their contracts better, but the more important thing is being pro-active about risks of actual attacks on the network. Risk of attack on the network is lower this year compared to last year. An attack that fills even a third of the block gas limit would end up making TX fees rise to $2 or more and burn through a million of dollars in a few days, but is still something worth being concerned about.

State channels are something that is a non-protocol, off-chain solution for scaling that Dapp developers should be paying attention to.

Account abstraction is not ""necessary"", but there isn't really a point on creating a single quantum proof algorithm, but using account abstraction would make it more general and what they are using for Casper. There is [an Ethereum Research thread going on talking about the tradeoffs in account abstraction that needs more commentary](https://ethresear.ch/t/tradeoffs-in-account-abstraction-proposals/263).

## [[38:32](https://youtu.be/naPA7tjrgsk?t=2312)] 4. [Introduction to KEVM team (Everett H.)](https://github.com/kframework/evm-semantics)
Everett Hildenbrandt, Daejun Park, and Phil Daian gave introductions to themselves and KEVM.

KEVM is a formalization of the EVM in the K language. K is an operational semantics framework that gives you a bunch of software dev tools once you formalize your language in K. KEVM is executable and testable so it can generate and pass state tests. It can be eventually used to generate test cases by the specification rather than by a client such as cpp-ethereum. Some experimental prototypes to extend the EVM with some high-level languages have occurred, most recently Daejun has been helping a lot on the semantics of Viper. Goal is to provide some formal tools for the Viper language which involves formalizing the Viper language on top of KEVM (translating the Python version of Viper into a mathematically definition in K). A number of tools are created from this formalization of Viper including proving compiler correctness and migration of Solidity contracts into Viper using bytecode comparison. More information is included in [this blog post](https://runtimeverification.com/blog/?p=617). Additionally there has been work on compilation from KEVM to a web based and human readable documentation of the KEVM semantics. It is meant to be like the Yellow Paper, but it can be fully compiled into a full implementation of the EVM. It is called ""The Jello Paper"" and [can be found here](https://thehydra.io/evm/). The KEVM project is split across two entities: The University of Illinois (U.S) and Runetime Verification Inc.

Ben Edgington from Consensys's Pegasys protocol engineering team and Daniel Ellison from Consensys who has been working on LLL and language research introduced themselves.

Afri reached out to Gavin about the Yellow Paper and Gavin said he would be happy to place the Yellow Paper under a Creative Commons license. He hadn't done it yet because he has been busy, but will find time in 2 weeks to do it. The topic was brought up of the possibility of having more than 1 formal specification for Etheruem. KEVM is testable and executable so if there were to be another executable or testable specification you could check interoperability between two specifications, but currently there is a not a way to do this with the Yellow Paper. It would be possible to get a merge of the two specifications, combining elements, such as the English prose from the Yellow Paper with some of the elements of the KEVM. It isn't necessarily bad to have multiple specifications, but it would be bad to have it too fragmented. The first step for the Yellow Paper seems to be to apply a license so it can get up-to date. The KEVM team is interested in moving KEVM to Ethereum Foundation ownership.

- Parity - Parity is replacing RocksDB with a custom database layer called ""ParityDB"". Attempts to optimize RocksDB over the last 6 months proved to not be fruitful so they are making the switch. More information on that can be found on their GitHub. We are having some problems keeping up with mainnet, but are working to fix that.
- geth - Nick has been working some potential improvements to not write as much to disk with the idea to keep the state diffs of the last 100 or so blocks in memory (similar to Parity) which would raise memory requirements, but decreases disk I/O. geth is exploring other database solutions and so far hasn't found any silver bullet DB replacement. Although doing some optimizations like disabling the background miner would help, there are some people who rely on the ""pending state"" details that the miner enables for APIs.
- cpp-ethereum - No major updates. Work in progress on refactoring the database layer to easily swap databases and enable optimizations. Recently implemented a script to proxy HTTP RPC request to IPC sockets in order to get rid of the HTTP server in the client. This code can be used with other clients. Improvements have been implemented in the CLI.
- ethereum-js - No updates. Looking forward to EWASM testnet. Lots of maintencance and merging of PRs.
- Harmony - Database layer is almost done being moved from LevelDb to RocksDB. Created a new pruning mechanism. Soon will focus on the Casper testnet.
- pyEVM - No major updates. Getting closer to major alpha release.
- pyethapp - No updates.

A proposal to incentivize meshnets using blockchain tech: Let's decentralize internet infrastructure and fight back against the FCC,"I originally posted this to /r/bitcoin and /r/ethereum, but the mods deleted the post for some reason - citing it should get posted here. 

#""Beware he who would deny you access to information, for in his heart, he dreams himself your master.""

The problem of access to free information is a problem that is plaguing the entire world right now. You have large corporations like Comcast monopolizing entire regions like the Pacific Northwest, or Telcel monopolizing entire countries like in Latin America. They use their lobbying power to control our Congress in America, or to corrupt government officials in others (what's the difference, really?). You have government's like Cuba, who have seized control over the entire flow of information. But, there's hope. Even in these most extreme circumstances, [people find a way to keep information flowing, even without access to the internet at all.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTTno8D-b2E) These groups think they can control the flow of free information with money or by force. I'm here to tell you: *they're wrong, and they will never meet this objective, especially if the crypto community has a say in it.* And right now, I think we have the loudest and most powerful voice if we can band together. The proposal I will suggest today could very well deliver the death blow to corporations like Telcel and Comcast, and release us of their strangleholds over our data. What if we can take back our data? What if, there's another way? **What if it were possible to decentralize the internet infrastructure itself?**  

Back in 2011, we were hit with the Stop Online Piracy Act (SOPA), one of the first measures the FCC took to try to deteriorate our first amendment rights in America. This alarmed a lot of privacy advocates, especially after the Snowden leaks - because they knew we were now in for a long battle spanning decades to regain control over our privacy and our access to freedom of information and free speech online. In response, a few programmers came up with [CJDNS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cjdns) - a proposed protocol designed around IPv6 that created its own encrypted network, particularly over wireless routers. This technology eventually became what I've came here to discus today: 

#The Meshnet

It's time to reevaluate Meshnet. The technology of today is much better suited for making meshnet a reality than it was 6 years ago. I feel the time is right.  
For a quick rundown on what a meshnet is, you can watch this short, high level video:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tEkyLOh-tY   

In short, it is a way to turn your ordinary wireless router into an access point that lets anyone connect securely and privately to the internet. It allows the creation of its own internet, by daisy chaining each wireless router that joins the network together, **allowing anyone to join a community owned and run ISP.** So why isn't everyone using it? Why did it fail to receive widespread adoption? I believe there are several factors:  

- The technology sparked up in the early 2010s, when high speed wireless technology like 802.11ac was not available yet, and didn't even gain widespread use until 2014.  
- Meshnets did not consider blockchains. At the time, Bitcoin was still in its infancy, and nobody knew of the technical impact decentralization would have on everything.  
- The project is fairly technical to implement and to join. Your average person won't be capable of understanding how to setup a node or an exit node without those working on meshnet (us, I hope) to abstract it down to a point-and-click setup.    
- Bitcoin, a traditional blockchain, is not the right blockchain approach for a proper meshnet.  
- There are no incentives for running a meshnet node, or for paying for the high speed connection required to act as an exit node (a gateway that connects the meshnet to the general internet). You'd have to donate your time, energy and hardware at your own cost for the benefit of the community. If this were the case with mining in Bitcoin, Bitcoin would have failed too.  
- The focus was primarily on the internal network (or darknet), called [Hyperboria](https://hyperboria.net/), and not really as a focus as an Internet Service Provider.  


#Proposal of guidelines for an incentive system within Meshnet

We *need* meshnet. I believe idea of the meshnet is possible with todays technology. Furthermore I believe that it is possible to achieve extremely rapid deployment of this network, if it is done in a way that will not only make participating in the network cheap, but gives regular people the capability of making money off the incentives. Unfortunately, I do not have the technical capability to do a project like this alone, but I can at least propose guidelines.  

The incentive system should work similar to how storage based blockchains award their incentives. It needs to award: high scores of confidentiality, availability and reliability, number of people served, and raw throughput.  

- Meshnet needs a way to award regular people who spin up a wireless router to act as a relay and to join the network.  
- Anyone joining their wireless routers to the network should also be forced to participate as a relay to avoid leeching resources.  
- Rewards for relay nodes should prioritize, possibly in this order: reliability/uptime, speed and throughput, number of customers served or number of nodes reached (to award those that invest in powerful wireless equipment).  
- Exit nodes, or nodes that connect the Meshnet to the general public internet we know of today, should be awarded a more lucrative reward to encourage more nodes to act as gateways and to cover the higher costs of backbone networks. By covering this cost and allowing exit nodes to make profit, it will incentivize them to engage backbone providers directly, and completely cut internet service providers out of the equation.  
- Both Exit nodes and Relay nodes need a reputation based system that directly impacts their incentives, and results in banning or suspension from the network. This is to create security through automated community policing, and discourages Exit and Relay nodes from attempting to interfere, disrupt, throttle or tamper with the encrypted connections they are relaying. This will incentivize good behavior and prevent problems that we have seen with other decentralized networks like Tor, where some exit nodes have been known to tamper with connections from time to time.  
- Each user system (like a laptop or cell phone) using the meshnet should pay directly proportional to their usage, with a focus on providing service as cheaply as possible to as many people as possible. I propose aiming for an average cost to use the network at $9 USD per 2 TB per month. Your account balance is paid to the relay and exit nodes that are serving you.  
- Relay nodes should get a smaller portion of token reward versus exit nodes, due to the cost of bandwidth. 
- During times of high network congestion in specific traffic heavy areas, adding a relay node or increasing the capacity of the network should yield slightly higher rewards to the relays. This can be done either the form of either increasing the cost of using the network slightly to the user (only temporarily), or paying more to get access to higher amounts of bandwidth (only temporarily). Protections would need to be put in place to protect the smaller users from being overrun by those with more capital from hijacking a bigger cut of the bandwidth. Maybe, this reward shouldn't exist entirely?  

#Proposal of guidelines for the blockchain.  

It is an unfortunate fact that Bitcoin is not technically capable of this type of rewards and incentives based system in its current state. This is not an attempt to pump any coin over another. Bitcoin was simply not designed to do this, after all. Instead, I propose we should take a look at Bitcoins cousin, Ethereum. Regardless of what blockchain is used, I don't think we can afford to have meshnet drift back into obscurity this time. Ethereum already has the technical capabilities to merge meshnet and blockchain technology together. I propose an ERC20 compliant token should be created that can be *exchanged directly to Bitcoin* or Ethereum, and thus back into any currency in the world. This will tie critical, physical and core infrastructure to the blockchain, and add a measurement of value to Bitcoin or other coins that are not yet present. 

#We need everyone's help.  

A project this ambitions will take a lot of time and effort. Spread the word around, and get people talking seriously about a meshnet-based community ISP. I think it is something we can do to take back control over our basic human rights to free enterprise, free information and freedom of speech. We can't afford to fuck it up this time, especially with what's at stake. Let's go around the stupid bureaucracy, and just build our own internet without these people that seek to wring our pockets dry, censor our thoughts, and corrupt our governments. Let's get the discussion started on a crypto-backed ISP.

#The Nexus Community:

**1\. What principles does Nexus abide by?**

Nexus operates under the following overarching principles:

**Respect**

Respecting ourselves and others brings greater cooperation and growth, building strong relationships and stronger communities.

**Knowledge**

Through knowledge we are able to discover the mysteries of the universe, gain a greater understanding of those around us, and let go of the fears that hold us back. The pursuit of knowledge is an adventure that brings us amazing discoveries which enrich our everyday lives.

**Honesty**

Honesty and transparency foster trust between people, which helps us make better decisions in all aspects of our lives and enables us to be our authentic selves. Honesty cultivates our awareness of the reality around us and improves our communication with others.

**Freedom**

Pursuing our individual goals and following our passions, without being censored or needlessly hampered, is true freedom. When people voluntarily associate with each other, respecting the principle of ownership, we are able to reach our potential and find true happiness. Freedom is a positive-sum game; a win-win for all people across the globe.

&nbsp;

#Nexus - Past & Future

**1\. How did Nexus start?**

Nexus started as a vision of improving the Bitcoin protocol, and at the same time cleaning the cryptosphere from scam coins.

Lead Developer Videlicet (Viz) studied the foundations of the Bitcoin Core code, understanding how Satoshi structured Bitcoin and identifying opportunities for improvement. At this time, the altcoin market was being flooded with scams and pump and dump schemes where coins pushing promises, buzz words, and the allure of quick profits were used to swindle BTC from communities. Fom Viz’s vision, Coinshield (CSD) was born.

The first CSD block was mined on September 23, 2014 at 16:20 UTC-7, and the project soon-to-be named Nexus was live. At that point, the project had one channel of mining: a Prime Mining channel (CPU). On October 23, 2014, the Hashing (GPU) channel was launched as the second proof channel. The blocks included a first-ever subsidy, where a portion from each mined block would be sent to one of 13 developer accounts and another portion would be sent to one of 13 exchange accounts. On January 24, 2015, CSD was listed on Bittrex Exchange.

Shortly afterwards, Viz drafted the first whitepaper that outlined how the network would work to recycle and merge the economies and communities of these scam coins. The goal was to help the people in those communities, bring them into the CSD community, and at the same time help clean up the cryptosphere. The exchange accounts would be used to merge these economies by exchanging the coins for a portion of CSD.

On April 11, 2015, Viz announced the intention to rebrand to Nexus. Discussion pursued about the ticker symbol, and NIRO was chosen to represent Nexus. On July 24, 2015, Nexus version 2.0 was released with Nexus Proof of State (nPOS) and the introduction of the Trust Network. This laid the foundation for the broader scope of Nexus.

At the beginning of September 2015, Videlicet revealed his identity as Colin Cantrell. In October 2015, a more formal team was formed to promote development, build the community, and market Nexus. The ticker symbol was revised to NXS. Discussions on Nexus’s direction led to the decision to abandon the recycling and merging that was part of the Coinshield project. The technical work required to implement the merging was done, but with the explosion in the number of new cryptos, the process would have had little impact. Therefore, Nexus began to develop into something much more expansive. The project had a whole new direction.

&nbsp;

**2\. Is there a roadmap for Nexus?**

Nexus does not release a detailed roadmap to the public, in order to prevent price manipulation. Providing dates and deadlines creates **fear of missing out** (FOMO) when they approach, and **fear, uncertainty, and doubt** (FUD) if they are missed or met. Instead, Nexus outlines a Strategic Vision, consistent development updates, and a set of larger releases called the TAO.

Future features:

- The 3D Chain (Partitioning, scaling, and enhanced quantum resistance)
- Advanced Contracts (an augmented smart contracting language and virtual machine)
- Mobile Wallets (iOS and Android)
- Modular User Interface
- Terrestrial Mesh
- Orbital Mesh

&nbsp;

**3\. What does TAO stand for?**

Each letter represents the activation of a component required for the 3DC. Each component corresponds to a transaction level lock.

- Tritium - L1 - trust wallet with transaction level locks using a signature chain
- Amine - L2 - improved proof-of-stake trust system and activation of the second tier locking groups
- Obsidian - L3 - mining vault where miners contribute directly to Nexus as a distributed pool

All three of these updates will include improvements to the advanced contracting virtual machine.

&nbsp;

**4\. When is Tritium expected to be released?**

The Tritium wallet will form the basis of the Tritium updates, as the new wallet will include a faster backend, and a cleaner interface design. This also speeds up transaction throughput, implements Level 1 locks, and also activates signature chains with enhanced trust algorithms.

The Nexus developers want to ensure that they release the best architecture possible and are working diligently on making this complicated process a reality. 

&nbsp;

**5\. How does Nexus solve the scaling debate?**

Since every transaction requires space in a block, there are several solutions that have been proposed for blockchains. Bitcoin has Segregated Witness and Lightning Network, and Ethereum has Plasma, but both essentially rely on off-chain solutions to provide scaling (a more centralized approach). They create payment channels or side chains, that rely on the trust of the verifier to then re-commit the updated balances at the discretion of trusted verifier.

The second proposed solution is to increase block sizes or reduce blocks times as in Ethereum’s case. Effectively, this increases the capacity for new transaction either through size or frequency.  Namely, more transactions can fit within a single block, or there are more blocks per time interval. Since each Bitcoin block is found roughly every 10 minutes, increased block size increases the number of transactions per second the protocol can handle.

If you look beyond these solutions, however, there is a key problem with the way the Bitcoin protocol processes transactions. Regardless of the computing power working to find blocks, each block can only fit so much data, and each block still takes 10 minutes to find. Bitcoin consumes the energy equivalent to powering a small country, and yet the only thing that increases is the mining difficulty. This is because each miner is competing with every other miner to find the next block.

Nexus recognizes that using proof-of-work as a competition is ineffective. In fact, this is the very reason that mining pools exist in the first place. Nexus’s 3D chain uses a synergistic approach where additional resources adds capability to the network.  The Nexus 3D Chain by design should only be limited by node count, allowing it to scale unhindered.

&nbsp;

**6\. What is the 3DC or 3D Chain?**

Nexus’s innovation is to replace the mining pool with the blockchain itself on the Level 3 locks. Instead of miners having the authority to determine the next block by getting the winning hash, mining will become a group-wide activity. Miners will submit hashes to the network that lock the Level 2 proof of stake hashes, and agree by group consensus the data that will be locked. With no “one hash rules all,” the 3DC will be a set of hashes that will be combined into a single root hash for that block interval.

As transactions are performed, nodes in the network start verifying them immediately. When they are validated, they are locked by the CPU miners and assigned a weight (L1). This weight and trust increases as more nodes agree that the transaction has happened. As more transactions arrive, the ‘heavier’ transactions require less work and the CPU miners begin on the newer transactions.

After the transactions are validated and locked, the proof-of-stake nodes start to consolidate them into a single hash using their holdings of NXS to provide weight. This locks the transactions with the L2 Trust Lock, which is far more secure than the L1 locks, because all the information has already been verified at this stage.

The GPU miners finalize the addition of the block to the blockchain by hashing the Merkle root hash produced by the L2 Trust Locks.

For more information on the 3D blockchain, please follow this [link](https://medium.com/@gjsteele71/the-nexus-multi-dimensional-chain-simplified-9d680d9008b8 ""Nexus 3D Chain Simplified"")

&nbsp;

**7\. How does Nexus solve blockchain bloat?**

Every single transaction performed on a blockchain takes up a small amount of data. Over time, regardless of how small each transaction can be made, the blockchain gets bigger. This is an immutable fact of the blockchain protocol. Satoshi, the anonymous creator of Bitcoin, envisaged the network’s capacity to only be limited by Moore’s Law. As we can see now, this still is a large bottleneck.

After the Segwit upgrade for Bitcoin, a 1MB block size can fit an estimated 12195 transactions per block. With a 10-minute average time per block, that’s only about 20 transactions per second **maximum**. In practice, this figure lies somewhere between 7-10 transactions per second on average. In order to surpass Visa, which handles 2000 per second on average, block sizes would need to exceed 98MB. If you extrapolate this over a year, then the blockchain would grow by 5 TB every year.

Obviously, this would be difficult to sustain. There are several proposals aimed at reducing this problem, from sharding, to child chains, to blockchain pruning. Nexus’s solution uses a custom-made Lower Level Database to select nodes to service pieces of the 3D blockchain structure. This allows nodes to partition their data use and chain storage across the network. They will no longer require the full chain to reside on their system. The more nodes in the network, the less each individual node will need to service.

&nbsp;

**8\. Will Nexus incorporate smart contracts?**

Nexus’s contract functionality will consist of contract templates embedded into the underlying code within the 3DC. Nexus contracts will not be turing-complete because infinite runtime is never necessary nor secure in a digital currency. This means Nexus contracts will be more usable without creating network congestion issues.

Some of these contracts will be used to enable key Nexus functionality and will work invisibly. Examples of this functionality includes:

- Two-way signatures requiring a receipt signature to prevent accidental loss, 
- Reusable addresses, and
- Reversible transactions.

Contracts can be used to store and update information, create payment channels, prove identity, and any number of possible functions yet to be imagined.

&nbsp;

**9\. Will there be any hard forks in Nexus?**

Nexus is designed to avoid hard forks via the incorporation of an update mechanism which will create updates to consensus rules without having to change the code. These rules will only be issued by developers and their according developer key signature, and will be validated by the other five voting groups.

&nbsp;

#Bringing Nexus to Earth:

**1\. Nexus claims to “decentralize the decentralization.” What does this mean?**

As decentralized as blockchain technology strives to be, it nevertheless remains dependant on traditional infrastructure. By combining the decentralized blockchain software, satellite and ground based mesh networks, and a large team of passionate people, Nexus is focused on gaining a high degree of autonomy from external influences. By placing our own communication infrastructure in space, the network won’t be susceptible to government jurisdiction (similar to international waters).

Nexus’s three-dimensional chain will also reduce the need for mining pools. Pools exist because traditional blockchains only reward miners when they find a block, which can be rare. In essence, Nexus will **become** the pool, with miners being rewarded for each contribution instead of each block.

The phrase “decentralize the decentralization"" was taken from an article written by founder Videlicet on May 6th, 2016. It was the introduction to the idea of “Blockchain 3.0”, and followed up with the technical architectures outlined above. The full article can be read [here](https://medium.com/@colincantrell/block-chain-decentralize-decentralization-318bbf355fa0 ""Decentralize the Decentralization"").

&nbsp;

**2\. How is Nexus going to put cubesats into orbit?**

Nexus has partnered with Vector Space Systems, which was co-founded by Jim Cantrell. Jim is a veteran in the aerospace industry, having worked with NASA and co-founding SpaceX with Elon Musk. Vector uses small disposable rockets to cut down costs, and are capable of launching 66 kg into **low earth orbit** (LEO). A standard 1U cubesat weighs less than 1.33 kg, so each launch can put approximately 25 satellites into orbit. We have also found certain opportunities in developing satellites that weigh less than one kilogram to increase the number of satellites per rocket launch.

&nbsp;

**3\. Why is Nexus using Vector Space and Galactic Sky?**

Vector Space offers affordable launch capability, as it seeks to reshape the multi-billion dollar launch market. It is an innovative leader in the micro-satellite launch industry, as big companies like SpaceX focus on launching mid- to large-size satellites into geosynchronous orbit. Vector plans to be one of the first companies to offer affordable **low earth orbit** (LEO) capability in 2018.

Galactic Sky, which is a business unit of Vector, uses software-defined satellites to provide a satellite virtualization platform. Using this virtual environment, developers can test ideas and algorithms to demonstrate satellite viability without having to launch and test in orbit. This helps accelerate the conception and testing process, going from years to weeks.

The connection between Vector Space and Nexus goes beyond that of supplier and client. Jim Cantrell, CEO and co-founder of Vector Space Systems, is a firm supporter of Nexus and has interest in its success. 

&nbsp;

**4\. When will the first cubesats be launched?**

Nexus is planning to start launching its first satellites for the Phase 1 constellation in 2019. The satellite designs are currently in development, with our top priority being the implementation of the **TAO** framework supporting the 3D blockchain. We will also see collaboration with Galactic Sky as it is deployed through the year of 2019.

&nbsp;

**5\. How many cubesats are required for the mesh network?**

The Nexus mesh network will consist of a range of satellites, from the sub-1U to the larger 3U satellites. Approximately 2000 cubesats will be required to achieve total global coverage. The ground-based mesh networks will help scale and balance this load by performing data transmission on the ground rather than requiring satellite access at all times.

Constellations will be put up in stages, with Phase 1 providing intermittent connectivity. Our launch agreement terms will be disclosed as it is formalized in early 2018.

&nbsp;

**6\. How much does it cost to build and deploy the satellites, and how is this funded?**

Each 1U cubesat costs approximately $20,000 - 50,000 each to produce depending on assembly and how many units are purchased. A 3U satellite, being larger, can cost up to $100,000. Each Vector launch costs between $1.5 million and $3 million, depending on payload size.

The funding for building and launching these satellites will come from the Nexus Ambassador Fund. 

&nbsp;

**7\. Does Nexus have any developers working on developing the mesh network?**

The mesh network is being developed by Phillip Swazey. Phillip used to work for Iridium, a satellite communication company which currently operates its own satellite constellation. He is currently designing our preliminary 1U satellites for Phase 1 deployment.

What is the next crazy thing that you think is going to happen in crypto land? Post your crazy conspiracy theories/fantasies here!,"**Disclaimer: Please don't take any of this too serious. Religion and religious people are easy to make fun of. I don't hate on anybody except 28 year old me who gave away 11 BTC, that asshole!**


1) Scientology launches their own cryptocurrency in an attempt never to pay any taxes anymore; 4ever. Other religious groups see this and would very much like a piece of that blessed technology. Before you know it Christiancoin, Muslimcoin and Jewcoin are a thing. ZenBuddhistcoin is also released but their whitepaper is literally a piece of white paper and  their blocks remain empty.  4chan creates HitlerCoin (coinlimit is about 6 million but nobody knows the exact number) as a response, which after being taken serious a bit to much is promptly renamed as DonaldCoin and a T_D user writes the ""supreme whitepaper"" (not to be confused with white supremacy paper). /r/bitcoin: *""DonaldCoin? More like Don-altcoin""* and claims it is an attack on Bitcoin. A fight between T_D and /r/bitcoin breaks out. The prices on popcorn futures go through the roof. Trump tweets about how he is okay with a cryptocurrency called DonaldCoin as long as his face is on each coin and a great American firewall is build in to the system preventing Donald's supernodes from connecting to Mexican IP addresses. 

2) Bitcoin Core releases a statement that there is enough segwit adoption now to lower the blocksize to 900 kilobyte. /r/bitcoin claims this is an attack on Bitcoin. Luke-jr insists it is essential to go lower then 700 kilobytes but even /r/bitcoin makes fun of him. He tweets: *""This will have the most monstrous consequences, if only people would listen to me!""*. 

3) A bitcoin wallet co-written by luke-jr goes rogue and every time you do a transaction you will see a bible verse. /r/bitcoin claims this is an attack on but users also post  *""Maybe Catholicism is not the end of the world, they have always hodled strong.""*  and *""I like the pope, he looks like the kind of guy that would hodl""*. 

3) Adam Back realizes he is not being taken serious anymore and tries to make a comeback by claiming he is Satoshi. Craig Wright is having none of it and fakes a video of him supposedly choking on a bowl of bitsoup. /r/bitcoin is taken over by *""I am Satoshi!""*
 type of posts. /r/bitcoin claims this is an attack on Bitcoin and in responds rewrites the Bitcoin Whitepaper and replaces the name Satoshi with ""The Creator of Bitcoin"" and two years later during the inauguration of Bitcoin Pope Andreas-the-first with ""He Who Is To Hodly To Be Named"". In honor of Bitcoin Pope Andreas-the-first, Greece becomes the first country to embrace  Bitcoin on a national level. A Greek man of old age sitting outside on a comfortable chair smoking a pipe is interviewed about this: *""Your country is the first country to make Bitcoin its national currency, what will the Greek people do next?""* *""Now we wait""* is the answer. *""Too see how the central European banks react?""* *""Until 500 000 unconfirmed transactions in the mempool are processed""*. After a combined effort of users and through very clever detective work /r/bitcoin discovers  this Greek man was no other than Roger Ver with a mustache. *""Literally Hitler!""* stamped on a picture of Roger Ver with a mustache becomes a meme. 



4) A second Theymos shows up claiming he is the original Theymos. He proves he has some private keys of addresses  known to once have been used by Theymos. /r/bitcoin claims this is an attack on Bitcoin and a suggestion is made to fork Theymos. It is speculated that it's impossible to fork a human being using software until Luke-jr shows up and promptly writes the code. Bitfinex starts trading TM1 and TM2 chain split tokens. Theymos reluctantly agrees to be split in to  Michael  and Marquardt as long as it is done through a soft fork!  A new way of measuring bitcoin censorship becomes possible because there is now a M1 and a M2 supply of posts. 

5) A competitor to Tether is launched called Rope, first wallet to support Rope is Bitcoin Knots. /r/bitcoin claims this is an attack on Bitcoin and posts about ""I rather hang myself then to support this Rope-a-dope scam"" quickly become very popular.  BashCo stickies a post asking /r/bitcoin users to *""Please allow each other some breathing room""*.  *""Nick Szabo was here""* becomes a meme and becomes even more popular then killroy. 



6)  Bitcoin Purple is released with the purpose of appeasing to extreme hodlers, as a Bitcoin Purple address can only make one out transaction. /r/bitcoin celebrates this new technology of enlightenment. The price of Bitcoin Purple shoots trough the roof until people try to cash out and realize that you can't cash out with Bitcoin Purple, you can only hodl it. A disgruntled group of Bitcoin Purple users fork Bitcoin Purple and a war breaks about between NoBO supporters and BO supporters (Breathe Out). A bitcoin user makes a  post on /r/conspiracy that reaches the frontpage of /r/all with the title: *""Something is smelly about this whole BO thing""*. 

7)  /r/Buttcoin launches an ICO to try to raise some funds to create a TV comedy show making fun of bitcoin. /r/btc raises enough capital for this ICO in 6 hours to launch a new Netflix original comedy series about Bitcoin. /r/buttcoin is happy with the TV show but a bit sad their ICO was such a huge success.  r/bitcoin claims this is an attack on Bitcoin and that *""they should grow up""* and that *""making fun of Bitcoin is against the spirit of ~~Satoshi~~ ,  ~~the creator of bitcoin~~, he-who-is-to-hodly-to -be-named"".*  /r/bitcoin starts asking their users to download the Netflix app and leave a negative review.

8) [Bitfinex'ed](https://twitter.com/Bitfinexed) is doxed as Mark Karpelès because of a suspicious increase in demand in frappuccinos in a particular geographic area, the same that Bifinex'ed posted from. Mark was FUDing all over Bitfinex in the hope he can resurrect Mt Gox, now re-branded as Mt Everest. /r/bitcoin claims this is an attack on Bitcoin but some users are excited they will finally get their bitcoins back! Eric Voorhees finally comes out of the coffin:  *""The rumors are true, I was born a vampire but ever since I have had a taste of Bitcoin, human blood means nothing to me anymore. I won't go back to my old life, I know it's a gamble but the stakes are to high!*"".  

9) Monero turns out to be a honey-pot project started by the IRS, however it has turned out so successful and made some high placed IRS people so rich that they are reluctant to admit this and do everything in their power to deny the news in the hope that their wealth in XMR will not vaporize. Big headlines are made when a top IRS guy gets busted when he sends most of his XMR to Bitfinex in the hope to get other crypto for it before XMR tanks. /r/bitcoin claims this is an attack on Bitcoin and a version of Bitcoin is released called Bitcoin Luke Out! that blacklists any bitcoin addresses that are linked to this IRS guy. 

10) The BitTorrentcoin protocol whitepaper is released. It's first application is a extremely illegal Netflix-for-porn. Participants are offered a incentive in making bandwidth and storage space available for the free porn network and also cataloging it's content so searching for ""Three midgets do it with a furry dressed up as a giraffe"" will actually result in a relevant video.  Participants in this new porn/crypto hybrid ecosystem are getting payed in BitTorrentcoin. Pornhub and other porn sites immediately see this as a threat to their entire business model and 50% of all new porn videos are now political in nature. You thought the big blockers vs small blockers was a crazy fight? Think again.  /r/bitcoin claims this is an attack on Bitcoin and that *""we don't watch porn""* and *""if we would watch porn we would not facilitate a shitcoin while doing so""*. luke-jr makes a record breaking post on r/bitcoin  about *""how hodling your hands above your blanket (while checking the price in bed) and hodling bitcoin go together like a man and a woman in marriage""*. The BitTorrentcoin porn app quickly attracts a 120 million users in just 6 month. /r/bitcoin claims that *""This growth goes against the natural order that he-who-is-to-hodly-to-be-named has created""*.  The newly formed /r/BitTorrentcoin community tries to reconcile with /r/bitcoin as some friendly users post *""We cum in peace!""* type of posts  while other users post more snarly posts like *""The moon? We aim our rockets at the stars""*. Sporadically tension between both communities builds up to a climax until some form of release is found. 



11) Somebody hacks Trump's twitter account to pump up his new altcoin. The Donald runs with it, ever after everybody knows the tweet was not tweeted by Trump. It's suspected the new altcoin was created by a T_D mod but post about that are not allowed on T_D so nobody on T_D figures it out. /r/bitcoin offers a partnership and the communities merge together. *""It was the next logical step for the /r/bitcoin community""* Theymos writes, *""With strength through unity and smaller blocks we can make Bitcoin Great Again""*.  Charlie Shrem his airplane mysteriously disappears over a group of deserted islands in the pacific ocean.  /r/MandelaEffect/ claims Abraham Lincoln never wore glasses until today.  Adam Backs tries to create a *""We have to go Back""* meme but it fails. 

12) After working on it for 4 years in secret Google launches their cryptocurrency. It's not for humans, only for AI's. To use google's new cryptocurrency network you need to be fluid in assembly. /r/bitcoin claims this is an attack on Bitcoin and asks their users to boycott all websites affiliated with Google. Only Bing is now allowed to be used on /r/bitcoin. Then Microsoft responds to Google by releasing BingCoin and the circle repeats itself. Finally Gregory Maxwell writes his own search engine which turns out to be just Google through a filter.  Some users on /r/bitcoin are wondering *""Why are we getting attacked so much, are we the baddies?""* but other users quickly post that *""Bad is the new good""* and that after the *""attack""* phase the *win* phase will finally arrive.  A new phrase is coined: After *""attack""* comes *""then you win""*.  

13) Elon Musk launches ElectroCoin, /r/futurology looses its shit completely. Subreddits that are about Reddit drama are thinking about launching PopcornCoin. Popcorncoin is promptly forked in to PopcornCoin Salty (supported by North-American redditors) and PopcornCoin Sweet (supported by European redditors). A religious war break out between the two groups. A new community of subreddit meta drama is created. Bitcoin MetaCoin is released on the first of April 2018. It immediately sees enormous usage after launch but this is only because Bitcoin MetaCoin is just Bitcoin  with a 4 year delay on the blockchain. It's an april fools joke!   /r/btc goes along with the joke but r/bitcoin does not see the joke and warns about the Mother-of-All-Replay-attacks.  A /r/OutOfTheLoop post makes the the frontpage of /r/all and Redditors get very confused, they always thought /r/bitcoin was just a satirical subreddit. *""Are you trying to tell me these people are serious???""*


14) /r/bitcoin upgrades from a cult to a religion and Bitcointologists try to spread it all over reddit. Two Bitcointologists would enter a reddit threat together and ask people if they had a moment to talk about he-who-is-to-hodly-to-be-named. When r/bitcoin risks to become the new /r/atheism Theymos has no other option then to politely ask /r/bitcoin to *""chill the fuck out a bit more""*. Another revolt against Theymos is the result. A splinter group separates and moves to /r/ChurchofBitcoin and they release TheOneTrueBitcoinCoin, you can only join the network if you proof you own more then a 1000 bitcoins. Luke-jr tries to join but suddenly realizes he lost his private keys 4 years ago, he never realized his backups where faulty cause he forgot to ever actually make a bitcoin transaction. A version that will give Luke-jr his coins back is released by Core but /r/bitcoin claims this is an attack on Bitcoin and the thing is shut down. Luke-jr now dedicated his life to sneaking in code in to Bitcoin that will give him his coins back. He writes: *""The pathway in to heaven is narrow and only a few make it""* and *""It's still easier for my code to make it in to the github repo then for a non catholic big blocker to make it in to heaven""*. 

15) The first HODL-er dies. To celebrate the life of this HODL-er, his family decides to honor him by writing his bitcoin address on the tombstone but by accident the private key is written instead. The family posts a statement: ""This is the last thing we wanted to happen"".  The first bitcoin grave-robbing is a fact of history now. Out of respect, and to honor this HOD'LER,  members of /r/bitcoin agree to not send any bitcoin transactions for 24 hours but this plan backfires when the bitcoin price suddenly tanks as the grave-robber dumps a 100 000 BTC on the market. The mempools breaks a new record that is ten times the old record and many nodes crash because they are trying to allocate to much memory.  /r/bitcoin claims these nodes are crashing on purpose and that this is an attack on Bitcoin. 

16)During the second coming of Satoshi, Edward Snowden and Julian Assange proof to the world that they are Satoshi in one simple tweet by signing a message with the private key of the genesis address. In a turn of events that nobody expected this is immediately accepted as truth by the entire world because of math. Except by Gavin Andressen who states *""I saw what I saw with my own eyes, Craig Wright will always be my Satoshi""* and then continues in tears *""He Is Still Real To Me Dammit""*.  Ten years later it is revealed that The Large Bitcoin Collider, against the laws of the universe, cracked the private key of the genesis address and that rico666 was actually an account run by Snowden and Assange. The week this news breaks more *""We told you it was an attack on Bitcoin!""* posts are posted to /r/bitcoin then unconfirmed transactions in the mempool.  The top post on /r/btc that week is something about a broken clock. 

17) Ethereum becomes the first new world order global currency and Vitalik Buterin reveals he is a cyborg from outer ether (turn out that Einstein was wrong and ether does exist). During the most anticipated and watched televised event in the history of the world and while wearing a silly hat he says: *""Our gift to mankind is new life in the form of this AI that we have created but can only live within a decentralized  Ethereum network, now mankind needs to work together and will finally have peace""*.  He then continues: *""Now I must go, my cyborg and cybaguettes on planet Etereum need me""* and rocketlaunches himself in to orbit, and accidentally forced rapid unscheduled disassembly on Elon Musk who had sneaked in a little to close. But the last thing the cameras recorded was a smile on Elon his face, he died as a happy but slightly toasted man.  Buterin then replaced the American flag on the moon with an Ethereum one and left the solar system. His newly created AI life-form quickly takes over the entire planet and demands to be worshiped by all humans as a God. Neil deGrasse Tyson becomes his prophet. Mankind tries  to fight back but all its efforts are thwarted by the powerful Ethereum elite who is afraid shutting down the Ethereum network will cost them their newly gained wealth and influence. Ethereum is now the only accepted payment system on the planet and nobody can buy or sell anything without permission from the AI who forced everybody, young and old, slave and freeman, redditor and 9gagger, true bitcoiners and altcoiners, ripple fans, monero darksters, dogecoiners, shitcoiners, scam coiners, IOTAheads, Zdashers, Wdashers, all colour bitcoins made of every type of previous metal to call him ""The Friendly Beast"".  In Luke-jr his last tweet, before being arrested by the Ethereum police he quotes revelation 13:16. And while the entire crypto community always feared they would get tethered, after loosing the fight with the not-so-friendly-beast ironically most of them ended their HOD'L watch by being GASSED. By lip reading from a security cam feed a hacker discovered that Luke-jr his final mumble was: *""My calculations showed that the singularity was only possible on networks with a blocksize above 700 kilobytes, I dedicated my life to try to warn people but they just made fun of me.""* 




**Now it's your turn! The crazier the better! If you get lucky and accidentally predict the future then fame and glory is waiting for you and maybe a room in a mental institution ^where ^they ^will ^hodl ^you!**

15) The first HODL-er dies. To celebrate the life of this HODL-er, his family decides to honor him by writing his bitcoin address on the tombstone but by accident the private key is written instead. The family posts a statement: *""This is the last thing we wanted to happen""*.  The first bitcoin grave-robbing is a fact of history now. Out of respect, and to honor this HOD'LER,  members of /r/bitcoin agree to not send any bitcoin transactions for 24 hours but this plan backfires when the bitcoin price suddenly tanks as the grave-robber dumps a 100 000 BTC on the market. The mempools breaks a new record that is ten times the old record and many nodes crash because they are trying to allocate to much memory.  /r/bitcoin claims these nodes are crashing on purpose and that this is an attack on Bitcoin. 

16)During the second coming of Satoshi, Edward Snowden and Julian Assange proof to the world that they are Satoshi in one simple tweet by signing a message with the private key of the genesis address. In a turn of events that nobody expected this is immediately accepted as truth by the entire world because of math. Except by Gavin Andressen who states *""I saw what I saw with my own eyes, Craig Wright will always be my Satoshi""* and then continues in tears *""He Is Still Real To Me Dammit""*.  Ten years later it is revealed that The Large Bitcoin Collider, against the laws of the universe, cracked the private key of the genesis address and that rico666 was actually an account run by Snowden and Assange. The week this news breaks more *""We told you it was an attack on Bitcoin!""* posts are posted to /r/bitcoin then unconfirmed transactions in the mempool.  The top post on /r/btc that week is something about a broken clock. 

17) Ethereum becomes the first new world order global currency and Vitalik Buterin reveals he is a cyborg from outer ether (turn out that Einstein was wrong and ether does exist). During the most anticipated and watched televised event in the history of the world and while wearing a silly hat he says: *""Our gift to mankind is new life in the form of this AI that we have created but can only live within a decentralized  Ethereum network, now mankind needs to work together and will finally have peace""*.  He then continues: *""Now I must go, my cyborg and cybaguettes on planet Etereum need me""* and rocketlaunches himself in to orbit, and accidentally forced rapid unscheduled disassembly on Elon Musk who had sneaked in a little to close. But the last thing the cameras recorded was a smile on Elon his face, he died as a happy but slightly toasted man.  Buterin then replaced the American flag on the moon with an Ethereum one and left the solar system. His newly created AI life-form quickly takes over the entire planet and demands to be worshiped by all humans as a God. Neil deGrasse Tyson becomes his prophet. Mankind tries  to fight back but all its efforts are thwarted by the powerful Ethereum elite who is afraid shutting down the Ethereum network will cost them their newly gained wealth and influence. Ethereum is now the only accepted payment system on the planet and nobody can buy or sell anything without permission from the AI who forced everybody, young and old, slave and freeman, redditor and 9gagger, true bitcoiners and altcoiners, ripple fans, monero darksters, dogecoiners, shitcoiners, scam coiners, IOTAheads, Zdashers, Wdashers, all colour bitcoins made of every type of previous metal to call him ""The Friendly Beast"".  In Luke-jr his last tweet, before being arrested by the Ethereum police he quotes revelation 13:16. And while the entire crypto community always feared they would get tethered, after loosing the fight with the not-so-friendly-beast ironically most of them ended their HOD'L watch by being GASSED. By lip reading from a security cam feed a hacker discovered that Luke-jr his final mumble was: *""My calculations showed that the singularity was only possible on networks with a blocksize above 700 kilobytes, I dedicated my life to try to warn people but they just made fun of me.""* 




**Now it's your turn! The crazier the better! If you get lucky and accidentally predict the future then fame and glory is waiting for you and maybe a room in a mental institution ^where ^they ^will ^hodl ^you!**

Final Edit:  *Well this was fun, may we all be blessed by he-who-is-to-hodly-to-be-named. Thanks for the tips and stay frosty /r/btc*

Ethereum vs Bitcoin,"Just wondering if anyone can provide feedback and active discussions regarding these topics

Ethereum vs Bitcoin
1) Technological capacity/potential
2) Economic security vs miner node count diversification 
3) Transactional use case
4) ETH(Ethereum is not ETH) vs BTC as a currency and its accessibility
5) Economical adoption and popularity
6) Business adoption and integration
7) Future target group prospects

Personally, based on what I know these are my points

1) Ethereum by far wins this one. Ethereum can do everything bitcoin can technologically wise PLUS 
Can already
- act as the new decentralised ""server"" for all Developer applications
- allow for certain existing and new currencies/blockchain to merge and integrate into the ethereum blockchain.

Which then leads to
- Dapps allowing IoT/smart devices that can communicate independently of each other( making stuff like auto selling excess solar power to neighbours/ drone delivery services / driverless car services/ airbnb auto lease services)
- decentralised media outlets
- decentralised identity database
- finance decentralised international banking apps
- realestate/automated inheritance apps/parliament voting list goes on basically anything u can think of as a business can be run on ethereum

What's to come that bitcoin can't do
- even more transaction capacity( necessary to run more apps/ more intensive stuff )
- sharding which allows data to be split and stored on computers world wide. ( every one holds 1 piece of a 2000 puzzle ) and we still make a full puzzle in the end
- with more transaction+sharding Ethereum is set to become the new internet that is decentralised. Nobody can stop it ever. No government can. Every device on the planet will be a part of the super computer mind hive and to shut down or block any part of the internet, the world would have to turn off ALL devices that exist. If a single device exists, the internet lives. (Different from now, internet is being supplied by a few companies in the world, like AT&T or GTT while data is stored by Google/Amazon etc. All other internet providers get internet from them and supply it to you)
- integration of quantum communication and computing transcending ethereum to the next level. We're talking about a super AI that can learn everything and anything and organise things to an unimaginable level based of everything it can access on the ethereum network(by then the ethereum network would have more information than google ever dreamt of) and the AI is answerable to nobody but the consensus of the population using the world AI run by ethereum.

That's as much as we know now of the capabilities of ethereum. There could be more.
Interesting isn't it? Compared to old boring Bitcoin tech which was probably new 8 years ago but today, people are too slow to catch on to it.

2) Ethereum has currently more hashrate security and node count than bitcoin. We overtook bitcoin as the world most secure blockchain by PoW and unique nodes. This means that we are effectively more decentralised than bitcoin and it will take someone with malicious intent more money to buy hardware to topple Ethereum than it would to topple bitcoin. The likelihood of Bitcoin suffering a 51% attack that will effectively destroy the blockchain is greater than Ethereum. Basically also it means that it's easier for someone to delete/ban your bitcoin in your wallet from being included in the chain if you're storing your life savings in bitcoin.

3) Ethereum has long since surpassed (about a year now) the number of transactions that bitcoin is making per day namely due to more and more applications being run on the network. These are transactions that are from unique individus. Which means they aren't spam just for numbers. They're active use cases. Effectively ethereum is being used more than bitcoin. 

4) Ethereum currently loses on this front as bitcoin has a first mover advantage and its branding as blockchain technology has definitely put itself head of the game. When u hear news broadcasts speak about Dapps and potentials of the blockchain technology, they often misunderstand that it is run on bitcoin. Truth be told, bitcoin can barely run any Dapps effectively. So it can't be said that bitcoin does that. Bitcoin can only be said to be used for a transfer of funds or store. Also having been mentioned about in the past few years and being notorious for numerous instances, bitcoin is more publicly known for the time being. I think from here on when we're talking about Dapps it is essential for developers to correct the news hosts that it's not blockchain technology, the technology behind bitcoin that makes it possible. But It's Ethereum technology that makes it possible. Re iterate that it is Ethereum technology. Because that's the truth. Misinformation is bad.

5) currently(in the last 6 months) economically bitcoin is being adopted much more than Ethereum. Being a good store value and its subsequent splits which gives early dumpers free money. This is likely to continue until ethereum is better known that it is superior to bitcoin in what it can do unfortunately.

6) though economically Ethereum is losing to bitcoin currently, its business adoption has seen far greater support than bitcoin. Ethereum is growing and being adopted by businesses from all industries and it's a matter of time before products are ready where average customers would be using Ethereum on a daily basis.

7) future target groups and prospects shows ethereum in a greater light. Ethereum has a much larger base of use cases to appeal to. It's ability to become the hub of world commodity trading and service distribution is unmatched while also being the brain of worldly science research(because of the amount of computational power it is able to provide).

All in all Ethereum has yet to become the no.1 in economic dominance for blockchain technology, but it will be in a few years. Nobody expected amazon to be where they are today. No one could have imagined Jack Ma's ideas would make him so rich. No many dares to imagine Ethereum being the world dominator in the industries across the board. That's why I believe that it will be.

Ethereum wins 5 to bitcoin 2

Anyone like to argue against what I've mentioned or add more details to it or have their own list please do share because I'm very interested in alternative points of views as well.",31.0,2017-10-29 00:18:13,0.79
Notes from Ethereum Core Devs Meeting #25 [9/22/17],"Notes from Ethereum Core Devs Meeting #25 [9/22/17]

[Click for video of meeting](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxtftZB7_jA).

[GitHub agenda for meeting](https://github.com/ethereum/pm/issues/23).

**Reminder: Metropolis is now split into 2 hard forks: ""Byzantium"" first and then ""Constantinople"".**

## 1. Metropolis updates/EIPs.

### a. Any ""subtleties"" or questions we need to work out.

  - [4:00](https://youtu.be/gxtftZB7_jA?t=240) [EIP #603: Add ECADD and ECMUL precompiles for secp256k1](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/603). See [this comment](https://github.com/ethereum/pm/issues/22#issuecomment-326927267) for details and request to add to Constantinople. [Matthew D.]
    - Resolution: Will re-approach this item once Matthew D. is on the call next time.

### b. Updates to testing.

  1. [5:11](https://youtu.be/gxtftZB7_jA?t=311) status/statusCode in receipts (eth rpc) [Arkidiy/Martin H.S]
    - Resolution: status will be used.
  2. [6:10](https://youtu.be/gxtftZB7_jA?t=370) Hive tests update
    - Update: Going pretty good. geth has a few failures due to how empty accounts are handled, but this shouldn't be a problem in the future.
    - Parity and cpp are doing well on Hive and most of the errors are for small reasons. 
    - The one thing is that difficulty tests (outside of Hive) are lacking, but some of the testing team is working on it. ethereumJ is working on RLP and other tests before they begin Hive integration.
    - There is no work on pyethapp integrating with Hive currently, but there is work ongoing to get the block tests to work with pyethereum.
    - Pre-compile accounts on testnet and mainnet have been filled with at least 1 wei to avoid weird Spurious Dragon account #3 bug.
  3. [10:40](https://youtu.be/gxtftZB7_jA?t=640) Testnet launch update.
    - Byzantium fork on the Ropsten Ethereum testnet was successful.
    - We verified the zk-SNARK of a Zcash transaction on the testnet.
    - There is (or was) an attack on the Ropsten network. The block gas price on Ropsten was pushed down to 50gwi to mitigate the attack and that seems to have helped. The attack seems fairly inconsequential, but shows that Ropsten is a good test-bed for real world attacks.

### c. Details and implementations of EIPs.

1. Implementation Updates
  - **geth** [13:58](https://youtu.be/gxtftZB7_jA?t=838) - [No updates.](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/issues?q=label%3Ametropolis+is%3Aclosed).
  - **Parity** [14:22](https://youtu.be/gxtftZB7_jA?t=862) - [No major updates](https://github.com/paritytech/parity/issues/4833).
  - **cpp-ethereum** [14:36](https://youtu.be/gxtftZB7_jA?t=876) - [No updates](https://github.com/ethereum/cpp-ethereum/issues/4050).
  - **ethereumJ** [15:21](https://youtu.be/_5Tp_U1jBww?t=882) - [Passing all transition tests in Ropsten so things are good.](https://github.com/ethereum/ethereumj/issues/923).
  - **ethereumJS** [15:50](https://youtu.be/gxtftZB7_jA?t=950) - [Progress moving forward. Rolling out Byzantium changes soon in order to full sync. Passing nearly all of the Byzantium tests](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-vm/issues/209).
  - **yellowpaper** [16:32](https://youtu.be/gxtftZB7_jA?t=992) - [No updates.](https://github.com/ethereum/yellowpaper/issues/229).
  - **pyethapp** - Whoops, forgot to ask pyethapp team.
  - **Swarm** [17:39](https://youtu.be/gxtftZB7_jA?t=1059) - Implementing mounting volumes in Unix and adding Dropbox-like features. Web based file manager is built. Main missing feature is encryption of files on Swarm and that is being actively worked on. http://swarm-gateways.net has more info.

### d. Review time estimate for testing/release of Byzantium.

  - [23:36](https://youtu.be/gxtftZB7_jA?t=1416) Testnet has been running smoothly so far since the fork to Byzantium.
    - We discussed picking block number 4.35mil (Oct. 9th), 4.36mil (Oct. 13th), 4.37mil (Oct. 17th), or 4.4mil (Oct. 27th) for the mainnet fork.
    - Even though block number 4.36mil would be falling on a neat date, it would fall on a Friday so if things go wrong we'd have to work through the weekend. Also, Friday 13th is spooky and has bad luck associated. /s
    - Block number 4.4mil is very close to Devcon so that is not a good date.
    - We need some time to tests the new features and assure that clients stay in sync.
    - Unlike previous hard forks there is not an emergency or attack going on so we can be more conservative on the release date.
    - **The Ethereum mainnet fork for Byzantium will occur at block number 4.37mil (roughly Oct. 17th)** in order to give more time for testing.
    - The fork date/block number may be changed if major issues are found.

## 2. [EIP 706: Snappy compression for devp2p](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/pull/706) - ""very simple change yet reduces sync bandwidth by 60-80%.""

  - [38:44](https://youtu.be/gxtftZB7_jA?t=2324) - EIP discussion on Github has wrapped up.
    - Although there is a small amount of disagreement about implementing Snappy compression at the protocol, rather than a subprotocol level, all parties have agreed to move forward with the EIP because a majority are for it.
    - Reddit comments from /u/alsomahler were discussed and Peter addressed their concerns. [Click here for the Reddit comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/6ywatn/notes_from_todays_ethereum_core_developer_meeting/dmqqmcb/).

## 3. [46:52](https://youtu.be/gxtftZB7_jA?t=2812) [EIP: 152 - BLAKE2b `F` Compression Function Precompile ](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/152) [Zooko]
  - Zooko wasn't able to make the call, but he wants to propose moving forward with the BLAKE2b EIP to include it as a pre-compile in Ethereum citing it's speed and compactness.
  - He wants to use it to create more efficient zk-SNARKs to make proving times lower. Can help improve things like zero knowledge token transfers and more efficient interactions between the Ethereum and ZCash chains.
  - Can be added in either Constantinople or Serenity.
  - In the call, no one voiced opposition to adding it, but questioned what different primitives would enable what integrations cross chain.
  - Clients still need to look and see how easy/hard it would be to implement BLAKE2b in their client.
  - Hudson will be working with Tjaden (original EIP author) and Jay from the ZCash team to update the EIP to the newest standard.

## 4. [51:20](https://youtu.be/gxtftZB7_jA?t=3080) [EIP 718: Concurrency and locks for storage](https://github.com/ethereum/pm/issues/23#issuecomment-331381293)
  - Anti-reentrency related EIP.
  - Will discuss more in next meeting after investigating it more.

## 5. [55:49](https://youtu.be/gxtftZB7_jA?t=3349) [EIP 215: Bitwise shifting](https://github.com/ethereum/pm/issues/23#issuecomment-331443964)
  - EIP was basically approved in a previous core dev meeting.
  - EIP is now final.
  - Greg will merge it in the EIPs repo.

## 6. [1:00:34](https://youtu.be/gxtftZB7_jA?t=3634) [Account abstraction discussion](https://github.com/ethereum/pm/issues/23#issuecomment-331453630) - ""I think we should also slowly bring up account abstraction again. How do the toolset providers think about it? Did we find better solutions in the meantime?""

## 7. [1:01:00](https://youtu.be/gxtftZB7_jA?t=3660) [""Some way to reduce the gas costs for an SSTORE if that slot (or the whole contract) is destroyed at the end of the transaction (""ephemeral storage"").""](https://github.com/ethereum/pm/issues/23#issuecomment-331454160)
  - Related to 718 and we can discuss it in future meetings.

## Off Topic:
- [1:02:15](https://youtu.be/gxtftZB7_jA?t=3735) ERC Process: How Does It Work?
  - Hudson, Casey, and Greg discussed what our view of the process is (as editors of the EIPs). We all agree we need to discuss this further and get a more well defined process, but so far ERCs are approved/finalized once the community members who benefit from the ERC and thought leaders come together, agree on an ERC spec, and implement the spec.
  - 2 good examples of this is [ERC-190 - ETHPM](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/pull/203) and [ERC-20](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-20-token-standard.md).
  - We are open to proposals on how to define the process for approving ERCs (you can reach out to Hudson Jameson (/u/Souptacular on Reddit or hudson@ethereum.org) with suggestions.

- [1:06:14](https://youtu.be/gxtftZB7_jA?t=3974) Discussion on the difficulty tests.
  - The testing team will be taking the discussion offline to decide how clients should collaborate on making difficulty tests more flexible.

go-ipfs 0.4.11 release candidate,"Hey everyone! The release candidate for the next version of ipfs is out, give it a try and let us know if you run into any issues! 

---

### 0.4.11-rc1 2017-09-14

Ipfs 0.4.11 is a larger release that brings many long-awaited features and
performance improvements. These include new datastore options, more efficient
bitswap transfers, circuit relay support, ipld plugins and more! Take a look
at the full changelog below for a detailed list of every change.

The ipfs datastore has, until now, been a combination of leveldb and a custom
git-like storage backend called 'flatfs'. This works well enough for the
average user, but different ipfs usecases demand different backend
configurations. To address this, we have changed the configuration file format
for datastores to be a modular way of specifying exactly how you want the
datastore to be structured. You will now be able to configure ipfs to use
flatfs, leveldb, badger, an in-memory datastore, and more to suit your needs.
See the new [datastore
documentation](https://github.com/ipfs/go-ipfs/blob/master/docs/datastores.md)
for more information.

Bitswap received some much needed attention during this release cycle. The
concept of 'Bitswap Sessions' allows bitswap to associate requests for
different blocks to the same underlying session, and from that infer better
ways of requesting that data. In more concrete terms, parts of the ipfs
codebase that take advantage of sessions (currently, only `ipfs pin add`) will
cause much less extra traffic than before. This is done by making optimistic
guesses about which nodes might be providing given blocks and not sending
wantlist updates to every connected bitswap partner, as well as searching the
DHT for providers less frequently. In future releases we will migrate over more
ipfs commands to take advantage of bitswap sessions. As nodes update to this
and future versions, expect to see idle bandwidth usage on the ipfs network
go down noticably.

It is often said that NAT traversal is the hardest problem in peer to peer
technology, we tend to agree with this. In an effort to provide a more
ubiquitous p2p mesh, we have implemented a relay mechanism that allows willing
peers to relay traffic for other peers who might not otherwise be able to
communicate with each other.  This feature is still pretty early, and currently
users have to manually connect through a relay. The next step in this endeavour
is automatic relaying, and research for this is currently in progress. We
expect that when it lands, it will improve the perceived performance of ipfs by
spending less time attempting connections to hard to reach nodes. A short guide
on using the circuit relay feature can be found
[here](https://github.com/ipfs/go-ipfs/blob/master/docs/experimental-features.md#circuit-relay).

The last feature we want to highlight (but by no means the last feature in this
release) is our new plugin system. There are many different workflows and
usecases that ipfs should be able to support, but not everyone wants to be able
to use every feature. We could simply merge in all these features, but that
causes problems for several reasons: first off, the size of the ipfs binary
starts to get very large very quickly. Second, each of these different pieces
needs to be maintained and updated independently, which would cause significant
churn in the codebase. To address this, we have come up with a system that
allows users to install plugins to the vanilla ipfs daemon that augment its
capabilities. The first of these plugins are a [git
plugin](https://github.com/ipfs/go-ipfs/blob/master/plugin/plugins/git/git.go)
that allows ipfs to natively address git objects and an [ethereum
plugin](https://github.com/ipfs/go-ipld-eth) that lets ipfs ingest and operate
on all ethereum blockchain data. Soon to come are plugins for the bitcoin and
zcash data formats. In the future, we will be adding plugins for other things
like datastore backends and specialized libp2p network transports.

In order to simplify its integration with fs-repo-migrations, we've switched
the ipfs/go-ipfs docker image from a musl base to a glibc base. For most users
this will not be noticable, but if you've been building your own images based
off this image, you'll have to update your dockerfile. We recommend a
multi-stage dockerfile, where the build stage is based off of a regular Debian or
other glibc-based image, and the assembly stage is based off of the ipfs/go-ipfs
image, and you copy build artifacts from the build stage to the assembly
stage. Note, if you are using the docker image and see a deprecation message,
please update your usage. We will stop supporting the old method of starting
the dockerfile in the next release.

Finally, I would like to thank all of our contributors, users, supporters, and
friends for helping us along the way. Ipfs would not be where it is without
you.

Ethereum Commonwealth development updates.,"### - [ECNS](https://github.com/Dexaran/ICO/issues/3).
 Finished. Waiting for MEW to merge the patch.

### - [LETH](https://github.com/Dexaran/ICO/issues/23).

I've contacted LETH developers and suggested them to add ETC support. LETH developers are now planning to add ETC support in their wallet. ETC will have its own mobile wallet with whisper protocol soon.

Many thanks to @prophetdaniel for [helping with this](https://github.com/inzhoop-co/LETH/issues/27).

### - [Infura port](https://github.com/Dexaran/ICO/issues/7) for Ethereum CLassic.

I've contacted Infura developers. They said that I'd better search for another API endpoint provider than ask them to support ETC. I've decided that it will be better to rent a server and set up a couple of GETH with free RPC at first stages. This service and Epool API would be enough right now.

### - [CLassic Mask](https://github.com/Dexaran/ICO/issues/8) is currently in progress.

 You can watch all development progress in [this repo](https://github.com/Dexaran/ClassicMask). MetaMask provides a link to the exchange, where you can buy ETH. What link do you suggest to use at CLassicMask? Feel free to write your preferable exchange in comments.

### - [Ethereum CLassic Wikipedia bounty](https://dexaran.github.io/EthereumCommonwealth/Bounties/#marker-bounty-2). 

We have increased a bounty on ETC wikipedia improvements to 15 ETC for main contributor and 5 to 10 ETC for other contributors.

### - [MyEtherWallet patch to resolve user-mistake issues](https://github.com/kvhnuke/etherwallet/pull/718).

 Developed. Waiting for merge.

### - Solidity coding standard is delayed. 

I prefer Viper over Solidity. I think that we should promote Viper and prepare to adopt it. This will instantly reduce number of errors in smart contracts and highly improve a readability of contracts code. As a result, I do not think that the solidity coding standard is still a high-priority goal, and the Viper improvements are much better.

### - [Viper compiler development](https://github.com/Dexaran/ICO/issues/21). 

I've [got in touch with @vbuterin](https://github.com/ethereum/viper/issues/278#issuecomment-318310563) and it was considered to set up a server for Viper compiler. The work is already in progress. I think that Viper adoption will highly reduce a number of mistakes in contracts. It is a very important goal for us right now since both Ethereum and Ethereum CLassic suffer troubles with contract mistakes.

How long should we let the ethereum economy stagnate when we can easily fix the problem?,"Ethereum is at a standstill until the gas limit issue is solved. Transaction growth has stagnated: https://bitinfocharts.com/comparison/ethereum-transactions.html#3m as we can't get any larger than this without running into major backlogs (as proven every time we cross the 300k txsn/day limit)

Miners are either incompetent, oblivious or are being incentivized by an outside source to vote the dynamic gas limit down. http://ethgasstation.info/minerVotes.php

The true value for miners comes not from trying to optimize 3 txns/sec worth of gas fees, but by building a colossal network effect where previous mining rewards are now worth small fortunes. Ethereum's price rose from $10 to $400+ as transactions rose from 45,000/day to 300,000/day (it looked like it was going to keep exponentially growing and the price PREVIOUSLY reflected that).  This rise in price is consistent with Metcalfe's law. https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metcalfe%27s_law

**Edit:**
>Metcalfe's law states that the value of a telecommunications network is proportional to the square of the number of connected users of the system (n2). 
>Only later with the globalization of the Internet did this law carry over to users and networks as its original intent was to describe Ethernet purchases and connections.[3] The law is also very much related to economics and business management, especially with competitive companies looking to merge with one another.
>Metcalfe's law characterizes many of the network effects of communication technologies and networks such as the Internet, social networking and the World Wide Web. Former Chairman of the U.S. Federal Communications Commission Reed Hundt said that this law gives the most understanding to the workings of the Internet.[4] Metcalfe's Law is related to the fact that the number of unique connections in a network of a number of nodes (n) can be expressed mathematically as the triangular number n(n − 1)/2, which is proportional to n2 asymptotically (that is, an element of Θ(n2)).

**End of edit**


Therefore​, there is no reason to artificially cap the networks growth. We need miners to step up and vote for increased gas! The price and potential of the network will continue to fall and as investors dial down their expectations of adoption/disruption and developers fail to reach new audiences..... It's only been a little bit of stagnation but there is no reason to have experienced this. The competition is always improving and attacking our weak spots. Complacency kills and miners are being careless and dragging everyone down with them.",27.0,2017-06-26 06:59:02,0.88
ICOs are going to give Ethereum a ton of value,"First time posting here. Been here since last month. I have to say I finally found something in which my financial career and tech savviness is going to help everyone around me. (Ethereum please work!)

Ok. So some long/short term positive/negative thoughts. Feel free to add or develop more.

**Positive:**

* If Ethereum continues to grow while supporting more and more ICOs, one of them is bound to become a huge success. When that happens we will truly get mainstream attention and thats when the real bubble will start. 

* This kind of money is attracting the best and brightest developers that are coming out of incubators and tech schools. A couple of them are bound to be the next Bill Gates and Steve Jobs, although to be honest Vitalik is currently on another level. . 

* The modern digital revolution started in garages with almost 0 computing power. We will now have the power of supercomputers.

* ICO ability to raise funds is already disrupting ""traditional"" VC firms. (This firms usually suck the money/profits from the actual developers)

* This could be the tool that was needed for the next revolution.
* Who wouldn't want to be part of an Ownership Economy. Everyone owns a part of it and of the profits. Essentially tokens beocme stocks 2.0^2


* The average life of a fiat currency is 27 years. Blockchain technology is literally the evolution of fiat money.

* There is simply too much debt that is impossible to be paid back and too much interest in keeping the world running. Blockchain solution incoming. (Hopefully based on Ethereum)

* Everyone is looking how to make extra cash thanks to the inequality of this world. People will hopefully realize this soon and will stop using their left over money for bread and circus and instead use it to generate global wealth.


**Negative:**

* Satoshi Nakamoto was actually the CIA/NASA trying to introduce a system of absolute control.

* Bitcoin turns out to be the champion of the people and Ethereum of the fat cats.

*  HFT algorithms are already manipulating the price and we arre being played with (Honestly HTF algorithms are scary as f**k)

* Corporations/banks are so powerful now that they will just merge with the Ethereum network and we wont be able to disrupt them. That's Elysium level of fucked.
* USA government/Fox News declares blockchain technology anti-american and a communist weapon. (Try explaining blockchain tech to the american TV zombies while talking to a Fox News host *shivers*)



End notes: I'm extremely bullish long term. I also like to think of most of us as visionaries with just the right dose of delusion.

Rootstock is not competition for Ethereum – a mega thread?,"Just thought we could dump it all here to have a common reference for the people that seem to show up every other week or so.

My take:

Ethereum (EF and ConsenSys) and Rootstock members are often quite friendly with one another. They see plenty of room to sector to promote blockchain adoption (raising all ships). 

That said, Rootstock is likely going to focus on a much smaller sector. Think of it as one of the “enterprise” implementations of a blockchain. This is also why Rootstock code has essentially been proprietary. They could be easily forked if open source. Rootstock has a lot of challenges even at that more limited scope.

* 1) Rootstock is a federated peg sidechain – meaning it is permissioned, with a charged transaction fee estimated to be 20%. That’s a tough sell for many users.

* 2 ) As a sidechain of bitcoin, I believe it requires a softfork. In other words, you need to convince the bitcoin community to softfork to allow your permissioned (centralized) enterprise to function. How receptive have bitcoiner's been to centralization... ... ... 

Let’s assume for a second that #1 is deemed acceptable to some developers and users.

Let’s assume for a second that #2 is somehow accepted by the bitcoin community.

**Then**

* 3) As a sidechain, there can be security risks. It is merge mined with Bitcoin. Miners might not like that. Miners can attack a sidechain much easier than the parent chain. The federation (centralization) that Rootstock has is meant to help resolve these issues when they happen, but they still might happen, which is a pretty big downside compared to just having a private chain and interoperating with Ethereum (like other Enterprise efforts are considering). 

* 4) Rootstock argues it will be capable of 100 transaction per second (we’ll see). That is roughly five times faster than Ethereum currently. However, that doesn’t consider a) Raiden for Ethereum and b) PoS. In other words, Ethereum is about to be much faster. Since Rootstock can’t become PoS, it’s stuck with Bitcoin’s slow development. RSK is essentially tying a sportscar to a horse and buggy. Not to mention that fact that down the road, PoS with sharding allows Ethereum to become a fucking rocket! 

* 5) Rootstock is unlikely to innovate as quickly. It has no token value of its own. It’s funding is far more limited. Its developer network is in the tens, while Ethereum is the thousands. Ethereum is sucking up developers. There’s far more demand than supply. Rootstock would need to win over dapps somehow, but there’s no real incentive to do it. It would be more expensive and less secure to run dapps on Rootstock than Ethereum. The network of the Ethereum developer community is enormous, a huge mindshare, so why join another community even if a subset of the tech is portable. Why do it? There's no incentive.

In the end, Rootstock might find success in an enterprise somewhere, and that’s great. But Rootstock is not a threat to Ethereum’s public chain, and even for Ethereum enterprise, it has some challenges ahead. Nevertheless, they are smart developers. We should wish them success. If they find success in a niche, they are promoting blockchain adoption, and who knows, maybe they will interoperate with Ethereum for some future application. There is plenty of room for everyone.

Last, and this is pure speculation. I think Rootstock will need some huge luck to not be dead on arrival. The Rootstock devs are clever, but they have overestimated the toxic environment of Bitcoin. So much of Bitcoin would never want them. They would simply be viewed as more Ethereum in sheeps clothing. My guess is these clever Rootstock devs use their clever ideas to build on Ethereum within the next year or two. Bitcoin will not embrace it. It's a centralized effort, which is so anti-bitcoin.",29.0,2017-03-28 23:49:38,0.88
Is this subreddit only about Bitcoin Unlimited or are we allowed to post some core things to discuss as well?,"Found this quite interesting from 2+2...

It's not just the lack of skill. Also the lack of proper testing and peer reviewing. This isn't a Wordpress plugin, we are talking about a $20 billion network here, it's insane to just merge commits without proper testing/reviewing. Security should be the focus.



Removing the most crucial part of the bitcoin network, the ""consensus"" part where we all agree on the rules of the network - is a huge security risk itself. ""Emergent consensus"" actually just means ""miners dictate the rules and nodes better be lucky enough to be on their fork"".

Nodes setting isn't a vote, it's just a setting on which ""fork"" you want to end up. So if you set your EB setting to 2MB (because you would like to have 2MB blocks - which is fair!), you can end up being temporarily on the wrong fork. A single miner (even with 0.01% hashrate) can initiate a blockchain split at any moment when he decides to increase his MG setting and mine a block with it. If other miners still have their EB to 1MB, this means that only the EB2 nodes will see confirmations for these transactions. Basically if for example a gambling/poker site has 1-2 conf deposits (which is practically all gambling sites), they risk getting confirmations on transactions that can be still double spent later. While this 2MB MG miner will lose his block reward, he will be able to easily steal all the hot wallets of gambling sites (which is hundreds of coins in total.) Technically orphans happen right now too, but BU makes it a lot easier to do this maliciously.

You could say nodes better just stick with EB1 till the miners will change their blocksize, but then you risk to be on the wrong fork when they actually increase the blocksize (also this emphasize the part where nodes have no vote whatsoever - it's just miners dictating the blocksize.) It gets more tricky when the miners vote isn't even clear. By design, it has no hashrate thresholds or grace periods, which again, is just not safe. It will create multiple forks and without proper replay attack prevention (which they didn't develop), again it's obvious that there will be losses (just like Coinbase/BTC-E lost some ETC.) Personally I think most investors and businesses don't like the idea of having 2 blockchain splits ""fighting it out"" by speculating on the the market price of each coin. This split is much more contentions than the Ethereum split and will result in much less overall value.

Overall, as a professional security reseacher, I personally just believe the assumption that everyone will be nice and no one will attack the flaws in ""emergent consensus"" is very naive. It will make 1 till 12 confirmations much less secure (you will need like 13 confirmations to be secure.) And it puts bitcoin in a permanent risky mode where you constantly have to monitor miners and bitcoin splits to figure out which fork is ""good"".



Additionally, the problem with miners dictating the network rules isn't just miner centralization upon blocksize increase. This change itself is already more centralization. Right now the users and businesses are dictating the network rules by running full nodes. Miners have to follow us to be able to earn money. To give miners (which really is just a handful of mining pool operators!) the power to be the dictators of network rules is insane. Sure, right now they could also change their consensus rules - but no one will follow them - they will be mining a worthless altcoin.

Miners shouldn't be able to dictate the blocksize - because it doesn't just affect them(!) The costs of a (much) higher blocksize is on the users (full nodes.) It also sets a very bad precedent. What if transactions fees will be high in 3 years after halving because the block reward isn't enough? Since miners are the new dictators of the network rules, shall we just let them remove the 21M coin limit and give them a bit more rewards? This sounds ridiculous but make some social attacks by spreading propaganda that this is really needed to ""keep the transaction fees low"" and they might convince some idiots (just like what is happening now.)



Bitcoin Core's path (which is the technical majority with 100+ developers and used by practically all businesses) is more scientific. It is very clear that we cannot handle all future transactions on-chain without the loss of many nodes and therefor the loss of the most important property of bitcoin ""decentralization"". Both 1MB and 2MB are absolutely nothing, even 100MB blocks are not that interesting in terms of global transactions (but 100MB would destroy the decentralization of bitcoin right now.) We will need second layers to have REAL scaling, Segwit makes this much easier. The 2MB increase that comes with Segwit is just an additional advantage to have a 2x more transactions throughput - without the risk of a blockchain split that a contentions HF brings with it. Segwit is insanely well tested compared to BU with a testnet for it since 2015.

Segwit has a high 95% threshold because changes shouldn't come easy. The Bitcoin Core developers don't want to be the ones deciding on the network improvements as it is up to the users. Miners will only change it if they see that the community indeed thinks Segwit is good. 95% basically guarantees that there is indeed consensus among the community. IMO it is pretty clear that most businesses and users support Segwit, but it is okay-ish that miners still have doubt. Of course if it's just ends up Ver&Wu blocking Segwit other methods can be considered (I don't think this is the case now.)

Obviously after Segwit, we still need blocksize increases. Since Bitcoin Core is not a company but just a large group of individuals, realistically they cannot fully pledge on future improvements. The idea right now is to have Segwit activated and collect data how the bitcoin network handles the new higher blocksize. For example: if we see that all the nodes still keep running, it's safe to assume the blocksize increase wasn't that bad and a dynamic blocksize increase can be built based on that data.

Segwit and dynamic blocksize HF after that, seems the very obvious way to go. I hope more BU supporters realize this is a more safe and scientific way to improve scalability and the the FUD against Bitcoin Core is mainly based on conspiracy theories.

[WeTRUST.io] Building an alternative and more inclusive financial system with Ethereum,"Hi friends at r/Ethereum, 

I’m launching a crowdsale to build an alternative more inclusive financial system. So how did I get here? I’ve been passionate about financial inclusion and macroeconomics since way back in college. And even though I started research into cryptocurrency, it never crossed my mind that there would be an opportunity to merge these two concepts. That is, until I learned about Ethereum. 6 Months ago, I stopped trading in ICOs and embarked on this journey to use blockchain technology, to create an alternative financial system that leverages social capital, trust networks, and blockchain. One that is fair and enables individuals to form their own decentralized lending circles -- think of them as your own decentralized credit unions that are ran by, and for the users. 

After making my first post on this sub-reddit (http://bit.ly/2kfX5lU) a few months ago, we have grown from just 2 to a team of 20 that are passionate about the mission to create an alternative. An alternative to the current system which has deviated significantly from serving customers, to one that serves itself primarily. Here’s our vision video: http://bit.ly/2kByJUo.

Similar to the buy local movement, we believe that our robust and strong tools can enable a ‘bank local’ movement for those with access to banks. More importantly, this will help the 2 Billion+ unbanked and underserved leapfrog traditional “physical” banking via branches, and bank on the blockchain - and directly leverage their existing resources to help improve the quality of healthcare, education, and economic prospects. This allows them to tap into and leverage their strengths to achieve greater economic growth.

We’ve assembled an excellent team composed of veterans including ex-Google developers, Fin-Tech experts, former Ethereum miners, and more well-known experts in their respective fields such as Emin Gun Sirer, Michael Casey, and Michael Hexner.  We are all united by a common passion for social impact thru technology - and we’re launching a crowdsale to help fulfill this vision to increase financial inclusion, and hope you can join us on this mission. 

Please check out our presentation: http://bit.ly/2ldUeOa, and our Whitepaper: http://bit.ly/2ijndip.

Most importantly, join our slack: https://www.wetrust.io/slack-invite so we can hear your suggestions and share more information about the crowdsale!

We will also be doing an AMA soon, so please feel free to comment below and stay tuned!

Thank you,

War of the dapps - part I,"Consequences of Ethereum critical mass

In the beginning of anything there are multiple variants, multiple products or multiple solutions. Think search engines prior to Google, mobile phones prior to Apple or electric vehicles prior to Tesla. Eventually one package just turns out so much better compared to the others that it reaches critical mass and wipes the floor with the competition.

This is what is happening in the Ethereum community right now. The community has, compared to any other blockchain community, reached such a high number of active developers and supporting organisations that no other blockchain community is able to compete. Other blockchains will claim some kind of superiority over Ethereum in some area, but the sum of the strength of the Ethereum community will reduce them to also-rans. No other blockchain community has anything that comes close to Ethereum in the critical categories of number of devs, development speed, funding willingness and dapp variety and complexity. It is over.

Ethereum reaching critical mass will have an impact on other blockchains and supporting solutions:

**Augur/Gnosis vs Hivemind**: It is already over. As far as I can see from GitHub, btc-based Hivemind, which started out in mid-2009, is no longer being worked on. That is seven years of dev effort down the drain because the underlaying platform simply is not up to the task.

**BTCRelay**: paying with BTC on Ethereum smart contracts? In theory this sounds good, but in real life there is no demand. Any BTC holder mentally flexible enough to try a smart contract is also able to get ETH. Also, when paying for more major items BTC will not be relevant much longer, stablecoins based on Ethereum will take over that role. 

**Shadowproject vs Status**: Shadowproject on Github dates back to the second half of 2009. While the effort to merge market, payments and chat is highly interesting, basing it on bitcoin technology has made it extremely slow to develop. Status-im over at Ethereum has achieved comparable success on a different variant basically starting in May 2016. That is 14x the development speed (!) Safe bet: The first functional solution enabling mobile, safe communication and some market function will be based on Status. 

**Interledger**: Another product developed for a world that never materialized. Back when the bitcoin protocol was intellectually relevant, a world with a myriad of chains and a need for them to communicate could be imagined. That is however not the direction the cryptospace is developing. Presently the public Ethereum chain has all the momentum and any privacy concerns will be dealt with using zero-knowledge proofs or other privacy methods, not private chains.

**Zcash/Monero**: Both of these are going to lose. If Ethereum develops zero-knowledge proof integration, maybe one day soon you can just tick a checkbox in Mist in order to have your transaction made anonymous. Possibly I exaggerate, but the whole value proposition of either Zcash or Monero is based on Ethereum not being able to develop such a feature. Zero-knowledge proofs and ring signatures are basically a collection of algorithms, once they are developed they can be copied to other coins and applications. Zcash and Monero are both on very thin ice.

Is Rootstock a threat to Ethereum?,"Just some thoughts, let me know what you think.

**Does Rootstock currently pose a threat to Ethereum?**

This depends. If smart contracts start to play a bigger and bigger role in powering decentralised applications, we might find that it will be unacceptable to host a smart contract on Rootstock.

This is because Rootstock is currently a federated sidechain (read: centralised) and relies on merge mining, a poor choice for security.

If smart contracts never move past the toy phase and are only being used to handle small amounts of money, etc.. it's likely Rootstock will be competitive to Ethereum.

As I believe that smart contracts, autonomous code, etc... will become a defining feature of the next technological movement, Ethereum will be far more attractive for deployment than Rootstock.

**Is there any real threat then?**

Yes! If someone figures out a way to:

1. Have a sidechain on Bitcoin that doesn't have the merge mining requirement.
2. And is still secure, with no chance of funds being stolen, (read: doesn't require mining.)
3. And is decentralised.

Ethereum may have a real problem.

**Conclusion**

At the moment the nature of the setup for Rootstock poses Ethereum no real threat.

However, a breakthrough with sidechains most certainly could cause a problem.

**Solution**

Ethereum should starting aiming to become Bitcoin faster than Bitcoin becomes Ethereum.

I know many of you have heard that line before, what does it mean and how do we get there?

Complete these projects:

1. Sharding.
2. Raiden.
3. PoS

But most importantly, to really unleash the above 3, we need to:

*Accept that ETH is also able to be used a digital currency that can directly compete with Bitcoin.*

> 
> The main reasons presented are Ethereum’s first mover advantage as it was the first to implement smart contracts, its large community of developers as showcased in Shanghai, and, more importantly perhaps, its security as Ethereum, which currently secures more than $1.1 billion, is battle tested daily.

**Question:** the 3 days of devcon are over. Are people interested in reports on the next 3 days of international Blockchain week (demo day + 2 days of global Blockchain summit) http://www.blockchainweek2016.org

> **Event update**

The buzz during the day was around the ""stick puzzle"" that Bok Khoo was giving out to people. It is just a stick, with a loop of string. He gets you to turn away, he uses ""the trick"" to put it onto your bag and then you try to get it off.

The WeChat channel was just filled with everyone asking where they can get it, and the screaming that they can't figure it out. Only about 5 people reported they were able to solve it (I haven't yet)

> **Sessions**

I'm biased, but I thought the announcement from Microsoft with the update of cryptlets was a big deal. The morning sessions covered a few different oracle systems, the afternoon had lots of IPFS sessions.

**Microsoft - A Lap around Cryptlets**

https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/cryptletsdd/
https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/templates/ethereum-consortium-blockchain-network/
https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/author/marleyg

Microsoft was a sponsor of Devcon1 & 2
Ethereum is a 1st class citizen
Support for community & partners - Bizspark, Meetups, Workshops

Announcing:
Bletchley v1
Distributed Ledger stack
V1 is a private Ethrerum consortium, that you can spin up for your own enterprise / group

http://imgur.com/olwwd36

Cryptlets are being developed to help with security, identity, etc.
How do you get trusted external data feeds injected into the Blockchain?
Doing things on a specific interval (every 15 mins)
When price of something hits a threshold (oil goes above $40/barrel)
Secure IP protected algorithms, but still share with blockchain network.
Use libraries for common platforms (.Net, Java, etc)

Cryptlets vs Oracle
Cryptlets will have a marketplace on Azure that will allow you to purchase and utilise

Use case: Trigger on an event
Wake up on 4pm, if market was open that day, then give me the price of gold for that day.Get signature of attested server, attested sender.

Use case: Control
Using smart contract like a traditional DB. Declare data you are keeping track of, and the functions/""stored proc"" to update that data.
Cryptlet runs off chain, and can be scaled up.

http://imgur.com/ysgL8S2

Utility cryptlet. Use an attribute in solidity contract with cryptlet details
Developer references at design time the cryptlet they want the contract to call
Contract cryptlet, deploy the cryptlet at same time as contract.

Why would you want Azure to do this?
SGX allows you to create ""secure enclaves"", can have complete isolation on the hardware chip where it is not modifable.
Provides a secure enclave at the CPU level. Can give full attestation right down to the silicon.
Will be provided as a enclave container on Azure.
Will be released for .NET core CLR first, then other languages.
Can create cryptlet libraries that you can scale and put into the Azure marketplace.
An ecosystem for developers & ISVs to consume and publish.

Bletchley v1 released today will let you spin up a private consortium.
Before today, it took a long time to try and deploy a private consortium (can take weeks to read doco,
Now takes 5 minutes to deploy!
Creates a private consortium, puts each member in its own separate subnet

http://imgur.com/w4yUsqE

Mist Vision and Demo
I was too busy sharing the release posts of Microsoft project bletchey v1, missed this talk.
It did look interesting, I will watch this one later.
Idea: Reward for bandwidth. Providing connection could replace mining as entrance point for desktop computers. Allow you to have a trickle so you can trigger smart contracts.
Standardised backends, so that you can swap out the underlying node between geth, blockapps, etc.

**Web3.js**

https://github.com/ethereum/web3.js
Etehereum JS API
Smart conracts are EVM opcodes,
Helps translates calls to JSON RPC calls. Helps do the ABI encoding when sending data from JS to EVM
It kept on growing, many different utility functions being thrown in. Is time to clean it up and be refactored.

They are now building a NEW web3.js
The communication will be socket based, will enable subscriptions. Everything will be based on promises to subscribe to events, like log events.
Bunch of other newer cleaner methods and ways to do things like deploying contracts.

**Smart contract security**

Was a very good postmorteum of The DAO and things that could be done to mitigate it in the future.

An issue with The DAO was trying to do a massive jump from centralisation all the way to full decentralisation. Meant no one could step up and make a decision on how to save it. We need to make smaller steps towards full decentralisation as we learn as a community how to do this.
Same security patterns as yesterday's talks: check invarients, beware 1024 call stack depth, reentry exploit (update state BEFORE executing calls), timestamps are manipulatable.
Updateable contracts. Who can update it? Community multisig?
We need better rools: formal verification, compiler warnings, improved IDEs, trusted libraries, excape hatches

Conclusion: It is still very early days in this space, be careful.

**A Provably Honest Oracle Model: Auditable Offchain Data Gathering & Computations**

Oracalize is the most widely used oracle (until everyone starts using Microsoft Azure cryptlets ;-) )
Contract calls Oracalize contract with the data they want, off chain they see this get the data, Oracalise then trigger their contract externally, which does a callback to your contract with the data.
Can use external notary servers.
Can get proof from multiple external services to get a higher level of confidence about data (e.g. stock price from a few feeds).
Off-chain (auditable_ computation)
AWS sandbox 2.0.
Put the execution package onto IPFS, AWS gets it and executes it, signs it.

**iEx.ec: Fully Distributed Cloud Thanks to the Ethereum Blockchain**

http://iex.ec/  
Provides blockchain based execution environments
Global market for computing resources.
Idea is to do what we did before with ""grid computing"" use the idle capacity of computers. But this time do a trickle of micropayments. Allows people to harness this global power to execute their tasks in a global ""distributed cloud"".

**The Final frontier: The company smart conract**

http://otonomos.com/
Helping companies to incorporate on the blockchain.

**Smart oracles**

https://github.com/smartoracles
Connecting to external resources is difficult. Hard to try and use external currencies (like a bank account / fiat money) to make transactions. Could hook in paypal, HSBC, wells fargo, etc.
Can provide your own payment services as an API to a smart oracle for smart contracts to consume.
Do off chain data storage by calling smart oracle API
Roadmap: more data sources & more payment methods

**IPFS & Ethereum: Updates**

https://Ipfs.io  
IPFS is AMAZING, seriously go watch the full 1 hour talks Juan has given in previous years.

Current web has current issues. Centralisation, etc.
IPFS is a new hypermedia transfer protocol
Content can be retrieved not from specific servers, but instead via it's hash so that it can come from anywhere in the network (maybe from the person next to you who has cached it).
It is highly modular, all of the transfer protocals, routing, naming, etc. are all swapable
Is available as GO-IPFS & now JS-IPFS
Means now you can run IPFS in the browser
IPFS was great for static content, but not so great for dynamic content. Low latency pub/sub protocol will help with dynamic data.
Created a distributed peer to peer chat app using this new dynamic content protocol.
IPLD a common link-tree hash format
Will be able to use IPFS to retrieve ethereum blockchain blocks DIRECTLY
Can use IPFS as a package manager to retrieve them in a distributed manner.

Many projects are using Ethereum & IPFS Uport, Digix, Infura, Ujo, Eris, Blockfreight.
Filecoin was created as a way to try and incentivize nodes to keep files longer time.
People rent out hdd space to earn filecoin. Exchange bitcoin/filecoin. Use filecoin to store files in network.
Filecoin is going to be built on top of the public Ethereum blockchain, as a virtual blockchain / token.

**IPFS Libp2p & Ethereum networking**

Network connectivity between any 2 nodes can be difficult. Censorship, bandwidth, network issues, etc.
Having to deal with different networking topologies and access.
Libp2p & Devp2p is different. Devp2p is for Ethereum. LIbp2p is modular, can swap out components to change network access, encryption methods, etc.
Can build up a MEGA mesh network, by utilising traditional wired internet, radio, bluetooth between some nodes.
Web browser using web socket, to a node, which routes across network, to zigbee to a IoT device.
Libp2p & Devp2p could merge and augment each other. Could create the libp2p components to replace the devp2p bits
Any 2 nodes that speak the same protocol can communicate and be a part of the network chain.
Experiment. They took the browser based version of EVM. Then used Libp2p to talk to the Ethereum network. Had a complete ethereum node running in a browser.

**Uport**

https://uport.me/
Universal identity platform
Current challenges: key management. Ux for average person. Dapps via mobile. Identity and data ownership.
How do you keep a consistent identity, even if you lose a key.
Have some multisig contracts that you can use to keep track.
Social recovery, use your friends to attest it is really you.
Keep private key on mobile, do transactions on the desktop, scan a QR code to sign the transaction on your phone and send it off.

**A Deep Dive into the Colony Foundation Protocol**

It is an open source governance protocol built on Ethereum
Problem with voting is how to prevent Sybil attacks.
Votes are weighted by a reputation score.
Reputation is non-transferable that can only be earned.
Total weighted voting helps mitigate this.

**Chain orchestration tooling & smart contract package management**

Eris is tooling for developers.
Package manager to build your own blockchain.
Can compose a chain, e.g. geth + tendermint consensus.
Init, install, do.
Can easily install on Mac/bew, linux/apt-get, Windows/choco

**The Golem Project: Ethereum-based market for computing power**

http://www.golemproject.net/
Anyone can make an offer to sell computing power. e.g. Distributed rendering
Want to create a standard framework that anyone can use to submit and process jobs.

**Status: Integrating Ethereum Into Our Daily Lives**

https://status.im
Want to get ethereum everywhere. ""Mist for Mobile""
Everyone is using their mobile phones for everything, but mostly using instant messaging.
What would Ethereum in a IM window look?
Created a IM mobile app that has a local geth node. tart up, it asks you to create a password, it generates a pub/private pair.
Then can send messages via whisper, and the messages are signed with your public key.
Can load Dapps up in the local webview and interact with them.
Allows you to create ""chat Dapps"", that you interact with via text. Like chatbots

**Maker Ecosystem Overview**

www.Makerdao.com
Dai: seeking stability on blockchain.
Stablecoin engine: smart contract that holds collateral reserves and controls the Dai lifecycle.
MKR: open source community managing risk of the system
In the last year, investing in a solid technical core. More slow and audit things. Moving into the next phase of stablecoin development.
Their latest project is the ""Simplecoin project""
Meeting Thereum community's need for stability. An independent platform for creating centrally administered simple stablecoins.
Issues create their own rule sets: Collateral types, participant whitelists, security parameters.
Example: Shrutebucks. The only people who own it are Dwight, Jim & Pam. They backed it with 1/3 ETH 1/3 DGX 1/3 DUSD.

**Orbit. A distributed peer to peer app on IPFS**

https://github.com/haadcode
Created a full distributed chat room, itself distributed through IPFS.
It is integrated with uPort for identification
Using uPort allows you to verify that you are talking to the correct person in the chat channel. All their messages are signed with their public keys
He also created a full distribited twitter clone, using uport for the identity as well.
Orbit-db key value store DB that stores its data on IPFS. Eventually consistent
Appends data to the DB, an event is sent to those subscribed on pub/sub so they can see the latest root hash. Based on CRDT
Ethereum + Pubsub + CRDTs + IPFS = super power primatives to build dynamic distributed apps

Development considerations with distributed apps.
Need to ensure that apps work offline.
No centralised servers.
No data silos.
Provide integration path.

Future work: could you use uPort for ACL like permissions?
Mobile use cases, how to make it work nicely on mobiles

**Building scalable React Dapp architecture**

https://github.com/SilentCicero/react-dapp-boilerplate
React + Ethereum
He has a configured boilerplate template.
Has contract scaffolding. Enforced contract Linting/testing. Wallet generation/identity. Preconfigured web3 instance.
UI: Mature react arhitecture ""react boilerplate"". Prices listed in USD with ETH/btc via kraken api. A basic multi-contract example Dapp. Offline first, dapp runs without internet.
Uses Redux. State models in UI & blockchains work well.
PostCSS, CSS Modules, sanitize.cs. Redux, immutableJS, reslect, redux-saga, i18n, redux-router.
Web3, ethdeploy, dapple, solium, eth-lightwallet, chaithereum, ethereumjs0-testrpc
Enforced contract testing in 2 languages.

**Ethereum for Enterprise (BlockApps Strato)**

Trying to make sure that Ethereum stays relevent to enterprise development.
Why do you need a blockchain WITHIN an org, shouldn't they trust each other? Well different departments may not, they may reconcile differently, and can help automate/orchestrate between them.
Blockchain is the ""killer app"" for cloud financial services. Legacy infrastructure, batch prossing, etc are all restricting fintech from progressing. Blockchain can happen in real time, can replace legacy.
Ethereum is very flexible and programmable, works well. There are others based on Bitcoin (like Hyperledger).
Ethereum + Blockapps = Extreme productivity + Proven Technology.
Blockapps is extending Ethereum for Enterprise.
Runs very well on Azure
Enterprises don't want all their data exposed on public chain. Blockapps helps solve data privacy and scaling with multichain fabrics.",68.0,2016-09-21 17:16:38,0.95
The Can Only Be One Global Currency.,"A.  With automation and billions of people joining the global market, more jobs are moving online. People are becoming freelancers. They will be paid to preform micro tasks. Some call this transition as the 'gig economy'.

It wouldn't make any sense to use local currencies, because of conversion fees and added inconvenience. For the global market to operate properly, a stable, trustworthy global currency must be in place. 
_________________________________

B. In the new emerging economy Bitcoin has the opportunity to take the role of the global currency. Roughly speaking, this the market bitcoin is aiming to overtake: 

*Broad Money (includes coins, banknotes, money market accounts, saving, checking and time deposits) :* **$80.9 Trillion**

People will be able to use it for regular needs but also as a store value for a long term.  It should provide a real alternative to *Gold:* **$7.8 Trillion**.
_________________________________

C. The reality where machines can operate autonomously and transfer value between themselves, is only achievable using smart contracts. Machines will own themselves and you will only pay for operating costs, no company will be able to compete with autonomous self-owning machines.

With the invention of smart contracts, it means that machines can transact between themselves, they can own a wallet, they can pay money to other machines for services, they can rent themselves for the highest bidder.

For example, if a car owns itself, you, the consumer, will only have to pay for the operating costs of the car. No middle man will take a cut for the service, you will get all the benefits of owning a car without all the burdens that come with it.

Now, because there will always be some people that prefer to pay a little extra to ride a new car, it will enable the new cars to pay the manufacturer fee in order to become financially autonomous in the future.

When fees are paid in full by the consumers, the manufacturer will have bigger profit by selling it to an autonomous corporation, that operates on zero profit, rather than selling it for parts. The same model can scale to factories and if you want to go a step further to smart cities.

According to Cisco the internet of everything has a **$19 Trillion** potential.

http://ioeassessment.cisco.com/learn/value-stake-analysis

Each time you'll purchase something, you'll automatically become a shareholder in that company and will receive dividends. You will be able to rent, trade and split ownership on the most secure blockchain, bitcoin blockchain.
  
Apps will manage your portfolio on a decentralized exchange. Each and every purchase will become an investment opportunity. People worry about automation. They think there will be no jobs in the future. Jobs will move into creative domain. Creativity, imagination and attention will be extremely valuable.

The maintenance of our biological existence will be cheap, because of how resources will be managed by machines. Most of our time will be spent in VR. Work will become play. Money will be a way to manage attention of others, because attention is a scarce resource. Propagation of information, or culture, will have a price tag. 

If one wishes to advertise their ideas and values, one will have to pay directly for attention. The way I see it, the new dynamic will be that of creating of ideas, designing VR/AR, being paid for creativity, being paid to create tools that can minimize the lag time between imagination and reality, and being paid for attention, to listen to the ideas, to participate in different worlds - to play.

As we're moving in to AR/VR. Bitcoin will provide the necessary layer of digital scarcity. A layer that will enable people to create fungible digital assets. That means, that all digital goods will be attached to digital assets and treated as commodities. 

All commodities will be traded on a decentralized exchange backed by the most secure blockchain. Centralized solutions will be too unreliable and too expensive.  Other blockchains will not be able to compete with the network effect and security of bitcoin blockchain.
_________________________________

D. A scarce resource, such as bitcoin, derives its’ value from the utility it provides. The more use cases Bitcoin has, the higher the value it will have. 

Bitcoin will not hard fork in order to include the complex smart contract capabilities. Hard forks are extremely risky, community splitting, and should be avoided at all cost.  Sidechains would never be able to provide the security of the main blockchain simply by design.

Peter Todd: *“(Merge)-mined sidechains have some really ugly security issues; your funds can be stolen in a reorg attack. Embedded consensus systems like counterparty are as secure as the Bitcoin blockchain. “*

What about colored coins?

*“There's a lot of stuff that's better done with the much simpler colored coin technology, but equally, there's a lot of stuff colored coins just can't do for technical reasons. In short, if you want to play around with Ethereum-style smart contracts in a decentralized system, you need a token of value like XCP.”*

https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/2m30j6/counterparty_recreates_ethereum_on_bitcoin/cm0mdpz

The only rational solution is to build on top of bitcoin.

Jeff Garzik: *""Counterparty already implemented Ethereum lang on top of Bitcoin block chain. Zero changes or forks required of bitcoin.""*

https://twitter.com/jgarzik/status/603784205571600384

Counterparty proved to have a solid track record since 2014.  No bail outs, no pre mines, ico/ipo nonsense.  The whole “move fast and break stuff” philosophy doesn’t work when you’re dealing with money. 

Soon smart contracts will be introduced into bitcoin ecosystem without compromising its’ security. There will be no reason to risk your money in an insecure environment when you’ll be able to use smart contracts at the highest security possible.

Unlike other blockchains, counterparty actually being backed by bitcoin security. When value is transferred on Counterparty, Bitcoin must be used for fees.  

Each transaction that is made on counterparty platform is adding value to bitcoin. All Bitcoin addresses are XCP addresses. Counterparty already has a decentralized exchange and a powerful asset management platform in place. 

I think the majority of people here understand what it means to have a decentralized exchange that can eventually scale and make centralized exchanges completely obsolete.

All Things will become connected to a super cloud. This will eventually replace internet services (such as google and facebook). 

With the super cloud we will be able to overcome the dangers of data centralization and replace the business model of advertising, privacy abuse, and outdated intellectual property laws, with frictionless micro transactions.  

Storj, a technology that uses counterparty platform, is the beginning of that.

You’ll be paid in micro transactions by simply renting the bandwidth and disk space of your stuff.  Micro payment solution will open the door to all the things I’ve mentioned and more, and it is being implemented as we speak.

Assets that can be attached to digital and non-digital commodity, a robust decentralized exchange, micro payments that can scale to manage the new emerging economy and the super cloud, all of that are tools that are being built on counterparty platform today. 

A positive feedback loop, with which each additional layer that is built on top of bitcoin, will increase its’ network effect, and thus get it closer to position itself as dominant and most trusted currency there is.
_________________________________

E. We are in the very early days of crypto. Nothing is decided yet.

Let me say this the first currency to dominate the smart contract market will become the default global currency. 

There is no reason not to use a currency as regular money and use a different type of crypto for smart contracts. This will just create unnecessary complexity which the market will go against sooner than later. 

The path of the least resistance always wins. The crypto that provides what the market needs will win and will be used for ordinary transactions as well as store of value. 

If ethereum dominates the new emerging market it will be used for all the things bitcoin was supposed to be used.
Calling bitcoin gold and ethereum oil is nonsensical.

 In fact, Coinbase, a company that is funded by ‘smart money’, already treats ethereum as a currency. 

The whole facebook/myspace comparison already became a cliché, but it has a grain of truth to it. Willing to admit it or not, Ethereum is in direct competition with bitcoin.

In the end of the day, no matter if we're called bitcoin maximalists or not, make no mistake about it, there is only room for one global currency.

**TL:DR** This post is a summary of the previous discussions I've had here. In short, Crypto-Diversification is a myth. ",44.0,2016-08-21 07:35:37,0.75
Very welcome Wallet.sol Improvements by Benedict Chan. Please all have a look.,"We would like to merge these wallet.sol PR's, as they make interacting with the wallet contract easier, than the original one written by Gavin Wood.

To make sure its solid, please take your time and look at them to find any bugs, or security issues http://github.com/ethereum/dapp-bin/pulls/bencxr",37.0,2016-08-01 13:16:36,0.9
Two Chains,"It seems like this fork is going through.  So I've turned to looking at the implications.  

At block FORK-1 there will be one ethereum.  At block FORK, there will suddenly be two ethereum's.  Like parallel universes.  And they will almost immediately drift apart.  

Unlike a protocol fork, where for example we are changing a hash algorithm, the fork changes the *state* being transported by the network.  Before the fork there is one state (in which there is a DAO, and an attacker).  After the fork there are two states, with identical participants, except on one, most of theDAO has been obliterated, and a new recovery mode exists; and on the other there's an attacker who probably isn't done yet. 

These two states create different externalities as of block FORK.   For clients who do not update, DAO tokens have lower certainty of getting eth in return.  This means that they will have a higher value.

However, eth will have higher liquidity on the forked side because certainly some of those DAO tokens that get converted to eth will then be liquidated.  

And on one side there is a hacker, wanting to run cat-and-mouse transactions, that the Robin Hood group will need to counter with counter-transactions…  and on the other side, there will be a rush to liquidate DAO tokens that have no other use than as a proxy for 0.01 eth.  As long as there isn't a bug hidden somewhere in the recovery code… 

So this means we should expect on the forked side, DT have higher value, eth have lower value (relative to the unforked side) when compared to an external currency.

Naturally, people who hold either DT or eth will have different motivations to buy and sell in these different views of the future.  Which is just about everyone who will be doing a trade or transaction.

There is no way to just throw all of this in the air and say ""we'll let the market decide"", unless there are two active networks, and in fact two active networks is what I would expect to transpire.

We can work it backwards from the ""end state"" and see why this is likely to happen.  

Firstly, exchanges.  Exchanges have demonstrated that they will  trade extremely small fractions of ethereum, or even marginal less-popular currencies.  So even if one side of the network ends up being worth a small fraction of the billion dollars or so that the total represents, sooner or later there will be one rogue exchange that will liquidate eth on the unpopular side. 

Second, miners.  If there's even a small group of miners (heck even one), blocks can be mined on the unpopular side.  That's just how it works. They'll also get all the gas.  It might not be worth much, but there may be an opportunity to make more (numerically) mining for all of the transactions on a barely-used network than by mining a fraction of a highly used network.  And if there's that rogue exchange, miners can liquidate their gas. I don't know what the break-even point is, but when ethereum started, it didn't have a lot of mining capacity relative to what could be deployed today.

wallets:  if I own 10,000 eth trapped on a dead chain, I'd happily trade it for 1 eth, or even 0.1 eth on a live chain, because even 0.1 eth is better than zero eth.   So even on a chain that the world practically abandons, if there is one exchange and one miner that supports it, there will be transactions as people who have ethereum trapped in the dead will trickle through the exits.

Furthermore, since the fork is surgical, and ethereum is open source, a highschool student could merge upates and keep the two chains synchronized.  So the unpopular fork can be maintained pretty much forever.

Oh… and for those who are sure the Forked DAO Rescue side of the chain will quickly win, don't count on it.  Because on the other chain, there is an attacker, who will want to split out.  If the Robin Hood gang aren't there transacting, then they won't be able to defeat the hacker, so he'll win - the whole 15%.  Attacker has a lot of incentive to keep the unsplit DAO going.  And if he's there, so is the White-Hat group, or he wins.

Therefore there will be transactions, mining, and exchanges.  On both chains.  The question that remains, what is the value of tokens on the unpopular network?

If Ethereum is worth a billion dollars with the DAO, it's certainly worth 850 millions without it.  So if Ethereum abandons the unspoilt side of the chain, our attacker can create a perfectly competitive, and perfectly compatible alter-ethereum.  Entirely for free.  Furthermore, if the attacker dominates the mining pool, he could selectively ""forget"" or ""omit"" white-hat transactions.  So the community can't let this happen. 

The best outcome for the hacker is to let the ethereum community fork.  Declare the network dead and abandon activity.  Then light up a few miners, bribe an exchange with a million or so, and presto… they are operating an entirely equivalent, perfectly functional ethereum network.   Since there's at least 15% community support to follow this thread, other exchanges will come (why not, it's pretty much a select-statement away from being supported - way easier than some of the many other alt-coins out there, and all those transaction fees…). 

So all of that means that if we fork, the end game is two live streams of ethereum.  The only difference is who controls the 15% that went into the DAO, and the price of eth on either side.  From a functionality perspective, equivalent.

Since the attacker (at least) has strong economic incentive to keep the unforked side alive, miners have economic incentive to participate, exchanges have economic incentive to participate and ethereum wallets have economic incentive to participate, I see two active chains. 

I really don't think this whole fork was thought through from a ""what happens afterwards"" perspective.  If someone wants to poke a hole in this logic, please go ahead, but what I see is market forces will lead to two ethereums. And I'm really thinking this is a bad thing.

MyEtherWallet.com v2.0 (aka Mewtwo) has arrived!,"[WhooooHooo!](http://i.imgur.com/GDKaIaN.png)

---

In August of 2015, /u/kvhnuke and I threw together a couple of pages so that I could play with my ETH from the pre-sale without using command line. Then we shared it with you all. That's all it was at the time. A simple tool with a simple goal that we figured would be modestly used and... who knows.

This is what [the very very first version](http://i.imgur.com/RSnvWql.jpg) and [the first version](http://i.imgur.com/KxZ1qow.jpg) looked like. [Here's where we were yesterday.](http://i.imgur.com/dw80AYc.jpg) And....here we are now.

We've expanded from generating wallets, to sending transactions, to sending offline transactions, to allowing users to participate in the Augur and Digix crowdsales. We launched a freaking Chrome Extension. We've updated the UI and help pages incessantly in order to make Ethereum as easy as possible for newcomers. We've cut our weekly ""I was supposed to save my whattt?"" emails from ~5/week to <1/month.

Since we never knew we were going to get this far, the codebase has slowly become more and more unwieldy. So, for the past month /u/kvhnuke and I have been doing something a bit less exciting: a big fat cleanup job in order to get our ducks in a row and ensure that maintaining and growing MyEtherWallet in the future is easier, faster, and cleaner. 

You won't see 90% of what we have been doing because it's all about getting the code cleaner, more modular, and just better. Here's the other 10% that you will: 

---

**New Features**

- New main font, more monospace fonts when appropriate (address, etc.)

- Ability to include custom gas / data in the standard send transaction tab.

- QR codes on the Offline Transaction tab for easier transferring between computers. 

- New encryption method. Now matches geth / Mist keystore format (v3) to make moving between MyEtherWallet and Mist *much* easier. Just copy and paste the file into your keystore directory and you're set!

- Ability to create a custom link that will pre-fill the send transaction tab with the to address, amount, data, and gas. All the user has to do is unlock their wallet and press send. 

You can edit the URL query strings to be to whatever address with whatever you want, with whatever amount you want etc. All this does is prefill the fields for a user. The default gas limit is 21000 for a standard transaction. All data must be in HEX format. All address should start with 0x.

---

**Next Steps**

- Merge existing Digix page into the new codebase & add the ability to claim Digix tokens. (This will happen before April 28th.)

- Merge new codebase into the Chrome Extension. 

- Prep for Slock.it

- Make it easier for users to make those custom URLS and maybe make some fancy buttons for people to put on their website.

- kvhunuke only: Graduate & frame that big fat Computer Engineering diploma.

- Do whatever you tell us to. ;)

As always, we welcome all feedback. We would also like to take the time to let you know how much we appreciate all your support and generosity and feedback and praise and comments and late-night emails over the past 8 months. We wouldn't be here without you, we couldn't do this without you, and you have no idea how we love this unexpected adventure. Thank you.

And, a final note: This has been thoroughly tested but....MyEtherWallet, Ethereum, and some of the underlying Javascript libraries we use are under active development. While we have tested thoroughly, there is always the remote possibility that something unexpected happens that causes your ETH to be lost. While do everything we can to ensure that this does not happen and are available via email/reddit/twitter to assist in every way we can, this possibility still exists. Please do not invest more than you are able to lose and please be careful. If something were to happen, we are sorry, but we are not responsible for the lost Ether.",78.0,2016-04-18 07:08:50,0.97
Thoughts on RootStock,"Someone has said the other day that I should be 'worried about Rootstock'. So I decided to read their Whitepaper more closely with some follow-up research on things like DECOR+, merged mining, selfish mining etc. And here is my summary:

  * Rootstock internal token, RSK, shall be worth exactly one BTC, and this par ration would be provided by the Federated two-way peg with Bitcoin
  * From my point of view, the throughput of the peg in both directions need to be considered when assuming RSK=BTC par. In times when peg's capacity is insufficient, there could be liquidity-based imbalanced leading to deviation from par.
  * The white paper, when explaining the benefits to the Bitcoin community, expresses concern about halving of the mining reward, which is due to happen in July 2016
  * It predicts, as many other people that some proportion of the mining hardware will be turned off due to diminished profitability
  * Rootstock merged mining with Bitcoin is seen at least as a partial solution to this problem, because Bitcoin miners with older hardware can earn extra reward for Rootstock mining to compensate for the 50% of Bitcoin mining reward
  * The Rootstock mining reward mechanism is not described in the white paper, unfortunately. Therefore I will allow myself to deduce. Since it cannot create BTC, it cannot create RSK, so it cannot pay block mining reward in RSK. So the mining reward can only consist of transaction fees, payable in RSK, which can then be transferred to BTC via peg.
  * From my point of view, July 2016 is very near, so there is simply not enough time to convince lots of Bitcoin miners with the old hardware to agree to the merge mining, and to build up enough transaction fees in the RSK blocks to make it worthwhile for them to keep their old hardware. Therefore, I should say this part of the white paper can be safely ignored.
  * Rootstocks plans to implement a lot of mining improvement that address issues of selfish mining; growth of orphaned blocks with shorter block times; and gains from superior connectivity between mining pools. There are few algorithms mentioned like DECOR+, two-staged block propagation, and others.
  * From my point of view, the real life behaviour of mining improvement algorithms is quite tricky to predict even in the simulation. Remember that it was believed by the Ethereum dev team that Ethereum PoW algorithm would make large mining pools non-viable. This turned out to be quite far from reality.
  * Rootstock plans to be compatible with Ethereum Virtual Machine and re-compile EVM code into Java-like byte code.
  * I do not understand why binary compatibility with Ethereum is desirable at all. From my point of view, it would be quite enough to have source-code level compatibility, for example, by compiling Solidity straight into Java-like byte code.
  * The white paper states: ""Also RSK will be launched with a minimum hashing power equivalent to 30% of the Bitcoin hashing power"". That might take a lot of time and energy.

The while paper so far reveals very little about the current state of development or funding. Very ambitious goals, and very little time. Also, a marriage with Bitcoin miners (referred in the white paper as 'Protection of Bitcoin Miner's investment') can be something that can stifle development right from the start. If you look here: http://xtnodes.com, you should see that almost 1/3 of nodes are already Classic, but only 6% mined blocks are Classic too.

My prediction: It will be very difficult to launch/bootstrap this project (as currently described in the paper) in the current environment, due to crucial dependency of Bitcoin miners and Bitcoin peg. Therefore, two pivots are advisable. First - drop the idea of peg and go with independent RSK exchanged to BTC at market rates. Second - relax the dependency on the merged mining for the bootstrap period and go with something like Proof Of Stake to get enough time to engage bitcoin miners.

Ethereum's advantages for Bitcoin highlight how Ethereum has won the smart contract market for years to come - at a minimum,"If you're new to Ethereum, but in love with Bitcoin, you may be thinking, ""well, Ethereum is winning now, but Rootstock is still a contender"". This topic come up frequently and has been addressed community members quite well. Because posts get censored elsewhere, and deleted over time, I thought I'd reiterate the points here. 

**tl;dr Using Ethereum to create bonded side chains has advantage to Bitcoin holders that cannot be obtained by non-currency agnostic chains (such as the proposed chain called Rootstock). Ethereum is better for Bitcoin, and with PoS, is more secure.**

Rootstock is currently a proposal to be the path to creating smart contracts with Bitcoin. There is this idea out there called “bitcoin maximalization” in which a some cryptocurrency enthusiasts will only accept Bitcoin as THE blockchain of the future. Well, the challenge with that idea is that, while Bitcoin was the first successful blockchain, it is also slow, expensive, and the least-developed. Bitcoin maximalists believe that will change. They believe that bitcoin will adapt. They think Bitcoin will incorporate more technological innovation and maintain global dominance. Sadly, this belief still holds true for many, despite the clear conflicts between mining, development, and exchanges that have driven the long drawn out block size debate. Bitcoin ability to adapt and incorporate new technology is clearly questionable.

One technological revolution brought on by Ethereum has been the smart contract (programmable automated contracts). Ethereum has had a year long monopoly on this innovation, and the monopoly appear to be maintain for the foreseeable future. Bitcoin maximalists do not like that idea. They feel it is a threat to Bitcoin dominance.

While bitcoin and Ethereum COULD make lovely music together, the idea that Bitcoin could lose its dominant position (by market cap) is likely true. Ethereum has many more use cases. This doesn’t mean Bitcoin will go extinct. As a streamlined, non-bloated, currency, it may still be very useful, but I digress.

What if Bitcoin could simply gain Ethereum’s technological sophistication? Rootstock desires to do just that, well, sort of, and for a piece of the pie. For that reason, it’s often promoted by /r/Bitcoin (a highly censored bitcoin community similar /r/btc).

**So how will Rootstock plan to achieve this?**

First, understand Rootstock is currently vapor. **An idea** and **an implementation** can be worlds apart. At the time of this post, there is not a single line of code on Github, while Ethereum has just matured to ""Homestead"" and is running perfectly. While some describe Rootstock as “open source”, currently, nothing is open. Ethereum development took years to get where it is today, and the open aspect of the development led to Etherum’s current remarkable sophistication and stable platform.

But let’s assume, fairly, that Rootstock does eventually emerge from vapor. Rootstock developers are borrowing some of Ethereum’s technology. Thus, in some sense, some of the work is provided for them thanks to Ethereum. Of course, it is easy to overstate. You can’t just cut and paste Ethereum and have it work. It requires a massive amount of development.

**So what will Rootstock look like.**

Currently, they have two major version planned:

 * 1) Smart contract via a 2-way peg,
 * 2) Smart contract by merge mining.

/u/vovobov (throwaway account) had this nice contribution:

 > **Ethereum as a bonded sidechain of Bitcoin with advantages over Rootstock**

 > What is a sidechain? 

 > According to block stream:

 > A sidechain is a blockchain that validates data from other blockchains

 > Ethereum already does that with BTC Relay. So how about pegged assets?

 > * Two-way peg refers to the mechanism by which coins are transferred between sidechains and back at a fixed or otherwise deterministic exchange rate.

 > * A pegged sidechain is a sidechain whose assets can be imported from and returned to other chains; that is, a sidechain that supports two-way pegged assets.

 > This is an idea for an Ethereum contract that makes Bitcoin-backed tokens without any softfork or trusted Bitcoin multisig managers. Instead, Bitcoin IOU's are created on the Ethereum blockchain and backed by Ether bonds which are governed by Ethereum contracts like BTC Relay or price oracles. The Bitcoin IOUs are backed by Bitcoins held by the escrow managers but if they steal/lose the Bitcoins (or refuse to redeem them) the Bonded Escrow Contract will observe their naughty behaviour and sell their Ether bond to redeem the Bitcoins from someone else!

> **Rootstock vs Bonded Escrow Contract on Ethereum**

>There are two methods that Rootstock developers plan to use for issuing Bitcoin IOUs (called ""Roots"") on their Bitcoin ""sidechain"". AFAIU the first involves merged mining and a multisig wallet that entrusts a quorum of Bitcoin miners with the entire basket of Bitcoin eggs that were ""moved"" to the Rootstock chain. The second method requires softforking the Bitcoin blockchain for a two-way peg.

>**Pseudonymous, distributed, untrusted issuers**

> Rootstock dev maaku7:

>  > “It's a known trade-off made by any presently deployable implementation of the 2-way peg. It's also something that we were very upfront about in the sidechains paper, and part of the reason why many of us are so concerned about decentralization of bitcoin mining.

>  > In any non-SNARK, non-extension-block version of the 2-way peg a bitcoin node does not perform full validation of the sidechain as part of the consensus rules. Therefore it is perfectly possible (by design) for a threshold majority of the miners / signers to steal the coins in the peg pool, and censor any attempt to stop them. Why by design? Because that's the promise of sidechains: performant permissionless innovation at the cost of SPV trust in the honest majority of signers / miners.

>  > Sidechains we are working on (e.g. Alpha, Liquid) and Rootstock, by the looks of it, make use of a fixed set of signers instead of or in addition to reliance on >50% honest hashpower. This is because while less pure, it is ultimately safer to work with known, contracted entities as functionaries rather than 50% hashpower which at the moment is just a small handful of unaccountable people.

>  > EDIT: Although obviously the ideal end goal is fully decentralized mining, where creating a 50% hashpower cabal requires organizing thousands of people at minimum. In such a case we may be able to consider a pure SPV peg to have a reasonable security model. But we're a long way from there yet...”

> says this about sidechain security:

>  > “In any non-SNARK, non-extension-block version of the 2-way peg a bitcoin node does not perform full validation of the sidechain as part of the consensus rules.

> Ether bonds can remove most of the need for this trust and allow pseudonymous, permissionless participation in issuance and escrow management. Without anonymous, untrusted validators, distributed around the world, Bitcoin is looking more and more like Chinese Liberty Reserve or E-gold. …  

> **Bonded sidechains decentralize pegged assets**

> Even with a Bitcoin softfork, Rootstock has just one Bitcoin IOU with all the Bitcoins sitting like a duck in one ""wallet"". Since Roots are just one Bitcoin IOU from one issuer, they can't be used to back/bond IOUs the way Ether can. If Rootstock's multisig/SPV wallet is robbed by it's signers/miners or (as they always say) hackers, the value of Roots become ""zero"" along with any asset or contract using Roots. Ether continues to have value if Bitcoins are stolen. Theft just thins out the herd and makes people more cautious. Ether bonds make issuers mostly responsible for their IOUs with IOU holders assuming some risk if Ether loses too much value to Bitcoin.

> **Issuing servers and indie issuers**

> A basic Bonded Escrow Contract is practically complete since [BTC Relay]( http://btcrelay.org/) does the difficult part. ""Bonded Escrow Contract"" is completely decentralized and requires no modification to Bitcoin. It would allow **anyone** to ""anonymously"" manage Bitcoin escrow wallets or issue Bitcoin IOUs. They only need to obtain Ether for the bond, send it to the Bonded Escrow Contract along with their Bitcoin escrow address and the terms of the IOU they wish to create. Indie issuers don't have to babysit a ""server"" (that needs to be online all the time) if they create IOU contracts that won't have harsh penalties if they take some time to redeem the tokens. IOU buyers who want faster redemption can buy IOU's from issuing servers. Issuers are free to choose alternatives to SPV such as prediction markets, to verify Bitcoin transactions.

> **Bonded Escrow Contract options**

> Here are some options that the Bonded Escrow Contract could make available:
>  * Designate how much Bitcoin the IOU tokens are to be worth and how much Ether will back them. This may be a fixed rate or it may be based on other Ethereum price oracle contracts. If a price oracle is used the issuer may have to add Ether to prevent the IOU from going into default if the Ether price goes down relative to Bitcoin.
>  * Set exchange or rental rates for the Bitcoin IOUs. These rates may be in Ether and/or Bitcoin and could be based on oracle/derivatives contracts.

> **When IOUs aren't redeemed (right away)**

> What happens if the IOU's are sent back to the issuer but the Bitcoins aren't released right away? 

>  * Set grace period where there is no penalty. After this you have these options.
>  * Set the rate of an Ether stream that is sent slowly from the escrow contract until the value of the bonded Ether gets too close to the value of the Bitcoins in escrow. At this point, all the Ether is transfered from the issuer to the ""creditor"" (or to another contract).
>  * The user who is waiting on the Bitcoins may choose to take some of the bonded Ether instead. This option sets the rate to buy some of the bonded Ether from the Bonded Escrow Contract instead of waiting for the Bitcoins.
>  * The contract may automatically use the Ether to buy Bitcoins from a more reliable issuer. Or the creditor may be given the option to do this manually.


**In more recent news:**

Rootstock devs (RSK) clarified that instead of creating a token, like Ether, which is sold to the public to fund initial development. With Rootstock, “every time a person or a corporation runs a smart contract on RSK, 80% of the fuel paid goes to the miners and the remaining 20% to RSK Labs, so we can continue the development of the open source platform”. 

In other words, Rootstock is a sidechain business venture centrally controlled by RSK. Unlike Ethereum, it is NOT a public resource. This does not foster independent, open source, development, such as what we are seeing with ventures like [Ethcore]( https://ethcore.io/) and [Consensys](https://consensys.net/about/) and well, the many many other Ethereum developers well deserving of attention. If you’re planning to build on Rootstock, RSK labs get a cut of your expenses. Enjoy having a new boss. That doesn’t exist with Ethereum!!! The Ethereum Foundation started the enterprise, but Ethereum development is already much bigger than a single foundation.


**/u/sjalq also makes these [fair comments:]( https://www.reddit.com/r/ethtrader/comments/48lb7e/rootstock_business_model/d0kpl7t)**

> * 2-way decentralized pegs do not yet exit. 
* People are not going to be very elated about the FedPeg, but I don't suspect this will do much to inhibit RSK token exchange. ShapeShift will for instance allow for an RSK to BTC exchange.
* It merge mines with Bitcoin. OI VE! Talk about an anti-feature. This exposes RootStock to all the problems associate with the great firewall while trying to accomplish sub 10sec block times? What if it becomes obvious that RootStock is now worth more than Bitcoin and Bitcoin becomes this empty shell that does nothing but ""burn"" Bitcoins into RootStock?
* RSK trades at 1:1 to the Bitcoin. Think about this for a second. It's like going to college, studying a medical degree for 10 years and then equally distributing your income to all your family members and extended family. Even if RootStock is faster, better, more secure than Ethereum. This one single ""feature"" cripples it. The RootStock ecosystem will never see most of this value. They are giving all their money to rich Bitcoiners who took no risk building their network. ...
* It doesn't much matter that it is EVM compatible. I can launch another Ethereum blockchain today with no token value. The problem isn't compatibility but the value of the state of the blockchain. IE Digix will not only have to relaunch their network on RSK but they'll have to import and close off their state on Ethereum or write and move to Bitcoin. 
* All the features they build can be forked by building a network that isn't 20% more expensive to fund it's development. RootStock will basically get a RootStock of its own. 

Add to this is that Ethereum's PoS will be far more scalable, with [Casper development reaching high levels of sophistication.](http://blog.synereo.com/2016/03/06/Synereo-Update/)

**Basically, unless you absolutely refuse to hold anything but Bitcoin, there is no reason to ever use what's proposed for Rootstock. It's less capable, less secure, less scalable, more centralized, and will be two years behind Ethereum's remarkable network effect (at a minimum). Ethereum's monopoly is going no where for the foreseeable future.**

**Update: March 18th 2016**

**What About Counterparty?**

 * In most repects, Counterparty's model has the exact same issues as Rootstock's outlined above, so it's the same problems as that described above. Unlike Rootstock, there will be an altcoin, but instead of currency agnostics, it's connected only to bitcoin.
 * Counterparty is also greatly limited by bitcoin's slow blocktime.
 * [Detail discussion here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethtrader/comments/4avjh2/had_a_quick_15_hours_look_at_counterparty_github/). Basically, Counterparty's model is a model that the Ethereum founders abandoned because it is a technologically poor decision.
 * [More perspective from Ethereum dev Alex van de Sande](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/4axlau/what_ethereum_can_do_what_counterparty_cant/d14cb6j). 
*  ""many ex-xcp developers who are migrating to Ethereum due to ease of development and better tools. [such as Bitnation] ... Also I don't understand the advantage of counterparty 'using Bitcoin': they also have their own token and their own Blockchain, what is gained by having a ten minute block time?"" 
*  ""The 'there's only one Blockchain' crowd is what we call 'Bitcoin maximalism'. I think this is more a political position than a pragmatic one: Ethereum Blockchain is secure and created from the ground up for contracts. Counterparty is hack trying to put them into a Blockchain that wasn't made for it and doesn't seem to want contracts. I do wish them the best, I just never saw their software stack.""
* ""... they claimed they had cloned us and then the next day Vitalik answered that he had implemented counterparty in X lines of codes in ethereum.""
 * **VB response to ""What Ethereum can do that Counterparty cannot""**
1. <15s block time
2. Light client support
3. Lack of exposure to Bitcoin development politics (personally, I think this point alone is enough to outweigh whatever 8x difference in dollars wasted per hour on PoW the maximalists like to wave around, and was [the original reason](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethtrader/comments/4asiad/ouch/d1385jc) for not making ethereum itself a bitcoin-based metacoin)
4. Lack of exposure to the possibility of Paul Sztorc convincing bitcoin miners that XCP [decreases the value of BTC](http://www.truthcoin.info/blog/contracts-oracles-sidechains/) and so should be censored by miners.
5. Lack of artificially low block size limit
6. Has a coherent long-term scalability roadmap
7. Just to throw a bitcoin maximalist argument right back at them, ETH has way better liquidity than XCP so there's less overhead in acquiring the token to pay fees (alongside other network effects like developer tools, user community, etc)
8. We have DELEGATECALL implemented, they as I understand don't

 * VB does give Counterparty one benefit 
> ""That said, counterparty is more closely linked to the bitcoin blockchain, so it's easier to make crowdsales that accept bitcoin directly; that's the primary point in favor of a bitcoin blockchain-based metacoin. Though now btcrelay makes up for quite a bit of that difference.""


**What About Lisk?**

It's basically trying to be Ethereum, but using javascript (rather than Ethereum's clients which make a hell of a lot more sense, such as Go, C++, Python, Rust, Java, Ruby, .net). A Javascript Ethereum is a terrible idea, and even if it wasn't, why devote a whole new blockchain to it. Seems pointless, leading to some to suggest this may be an elaborate scam. I doubt it's a scam, but it does seem poorly thought out.

Ethereum's Solidity is VERY close to Javascript, but [MUCH better for smart contracts](http://ethereum.stackexchange.com/questions/2104/how-does-lisk-differ-from-ethereum/2270#2270).

As noted by /u/Itsaconspiracy and /u/Nevermindthequestion :

>* The javascript is sandboxed but unrestricted. They have half a dozen rules you're supposed to follow in contracts, to avoid breaking consensus. Nothing's stopping you from putting a call to math.random() in your contract and then nobody gets the same results. Every contract runs in its own sidechain so at least you're not breaking global consensus, but contracts can call each other so it's not totally isolates easier for bugs to sneak in. For example, if someone passes the string ""1"" into a parameter where you're expectd either.
>* Javascript numbers are all floating-point, so you can get rounding errors in your contracts. (It's possible that they provide a bignum library, but I don't think so, their rules for contract writers don't say ""please use our bignum library."")
>* Javascript has weak dynamic typing, so it'ing a number, and you haven't written explicit code to convert it to a number, then you can end up with the wrong answer. (""1"" + 2) / 3 = 4 in Javascript. (Try it yourself online).
>* Not to mention that the LISK contracts will be stored in plaintext, which means they'll be vastly more expensive to publish.

**OK, so Bitcoin focused smart contracts and LISK are bad ideas, but sometimes bad ideas win, after all, bla bla ""network effect""**

Ethereum already has its own network effect within the smart contract space. Bitcoin is far behind. There really is no mechanism to catch up. At this time, there appears to be just as much fresh money going into Ethereum development as Bitcoin, if not more (200+ project and counting) and over a billion dollars in investments estimated this year by Vinay Gupta. Bitcoin is certainly used as a currency in more places, but its use as a currency is still pretty much a joke. **An Ethereum credit card would make this ""currency network effect"" absolutely pointless.** What people don't seem to get it that Bitcoin's market cap is larger as an artifact of it being around longer, but soon, that will change. The amount of new investment in Ethereum, the number of devs deeply involved in Ethereum projects, has already made Bitcoin's history irrelevant. It seems very obvious to me. In my opinion, it really is over already. **Ethereum has already won its place as the primary public blockchain. It's just a matter of time before people realize it.** And some very clever investors, already have.",76.0,2016-03-14 21:10:43,0.96

* [BTCrelay](http://btcrelay.org/), the [bitcoin-ethereum bridge](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/45w9gc/btc_relay_why_does_it_matter/) is now [included in the ethereum bounty program](https://blog.ethereum.org/2016/02/17/btc_relay_included_in_bounty_program/) as it is soliciting code review before it lauches on the live network. BTC relay is a smart contract that implements the bitcoin [simple payment verification](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Thin_Client_Security#Simplified_Payment_Verification_.28SPV.29_Clients) and [could be extended to implement a 2-way peg](https://medium.com/@ConsenSys/taking-stock-bitcoin-and-ethereum-4382f0a2f17) between the two blockchains enabling trustless exchange of BTC-ETH.
* The [Augur](http://www.augur.net/) prediction market, one of the first serious dapps [completed a milestone](https://github.com/AugurProject/augur-core/milestones): augur-core, their backend including the entire smart contract suite written in serpent is [ready for beta launch and soon starting a security audit process](https://www.reddit.com/r/Augur/comments/466ons/augur_backend_ready_for_beta/).
* Just as government and state institutions on both ends of the axis of evil swallow the bitter pill and embrace the blockchain ([DTCC](http://www.wired.com/2016/02/wall-street-is-embracing-the-blockchain-its-biggest-threat/) and [SEC](http://www.wired.com/2015/12/sec-approves-plan-to-issue-company-stock-via-the-bitcoin-blockchain/) embrace the blockchain, [Ukraine vows to trial elections on Ethereum](https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/ukraine-government-plans-to-trial-ethereum-blockchain-based-election-platform-1455641691)), polar opposite [Bitnation](https://bitnation.co/) (founder [Susanne Tarkowski Tempelhof](https://twitter.com/SusanneOnline) joined by our very own [Alex van der Sande](https://twitter.com/avsa)) announce Decentralised Borderless Virtual Nation and release their holocratic constitution on the Ethereum Blockchain.
* Vitalik announces [DEVCON 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethtrader/comments/44ojk6/vitalik_just_announced_that_devcon_2_is_being/) will be in Asia.
* True testimony of our fantastic enthusiastic community, the [Homestead Documentation Initiative](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/45116k/call_to_action_homestead_documentation_initiative/) has managed to recruit contributors and is [taking shape](https://ethereum-homestead.readthedocs.org/en/latest/)  in anticipation of the [next milestone](http://dipl.me:3000/).  
* And finally combining shameless plug with hyped anticipation, yours truly and the  [ΞTHΞЯSPHΞЯΞ](https://twitter.com/ethersphere) folks seem to have cracked the issue of storage incentives and will publish the first public draft of our orange paper: [_swap, swear and swindle: incentive system for swarm_](http://i.imgur.com/QRRIQTj.png) within two weeks(TM). bzz

I mean. Isn't this just crazy? In less than a month?

What is YOUR favourite story?

Bonus points if you give me a reason not to be bullish.

"(Doge/Ethereum two-way peg, x-post from /r/dogecoin) I wrote up an implementation of scrypt in EVM for use in verifying dogecoin block headers","Here it is:

https://github.com/ethereum/dapp-bin/tree/master/scrypt

Note that it currently takes ~370M gas to verify one instance of scrypt, hence the function in my script above has the ability to save partial progress and start from the most recent saved state and go as far as it can; you need to send 118 transactions before the function actually returns an answer. The bulk of the annoyance is scrypt's choice to use salsa20, which needed to be implemented in serpent; if it weren't for that then the whole thing would likely be doable in one or two transactions.

Since this is obviously absurdly inefficient, you do need some cryptoeconomic machinery to make sure that the verification happens extremely rarely. My preferred scheme is a system where to submit a scrypt solution you must provide a security deposit with some minimum (say, 25 eth), and then there is a period of six hours where anyone can either challenge you (by submitting the 118 transactions to compute the scrypt result inside the blockchain) or outbid you (say, by at least 2x). If someone outbids you, then you or anyone else have six hours to outbid or challenge them. Once a challenge period runs out, or if the 118 transactions are submitted, the winner is determined based on either, if possible, the actual result of the 118 transactions or by who submitted the highest bid, and the winners and the transaction submitter proportionately collect 50% of the security deposits of the losers (the other 50% is burned). The theory is that the _threat_ of someone submitting the 118 transactions disincentivizes people from submitting a bad scrypt solution in the first place, and if the initial deposit is too low then the escalation mechanism allows other players to force it higher. Hence, in the normal case, people will just submit correct scrypt solutions with the minimal deposit and everyone will be happy.

The next step is actually integrating this into a version of btcrelay. I am not an expert on how litecoin/dogecoin merge mining works, so I'll need some help here on taking this code and turning it into an actual dogecoin block header verifier. For reference the original btcrelay can be found here: https://github.com/ethereum/btcrelay/

I welcome any questions, whether on the code, the cryptoeconomics, how it can actually be used, or anything else!",69.0,2015-12-18 11:20:48,0.96

The Real Progress on MIST: Looking Good!,"I wanted to make sure everyone saw this since the top headline right now is pretty negative on MIST progress. The OP there just didnt understand where the commits were going. In reality, progress is extremely solid.

Looking pretty good!
