Digital ownership in the AI era,"Chat GPT probably changed the world. The genie is out of the box now. AI is mainstream. 

With this rise, you can create art, music, writings and everything in between. 

There are multiple artists complaining that thier work gets referenced but not paid by GPT.  

Is this where digital ownership capabilities shine? 
What if artists would put their creations on chain and they would get payed a small amount when their work gets referenced / used for generating a result.  

Apps would become sort of ""frontends"" and Ethereum + other crypto projects (e.g.: file storage) would become a ""common"" backend. 

In that way, all one's my posts, photos, stories, tweets become self custoded and one gets payed.

No one knows what will happen in 10 years time but I don‚Äôt see why people will start shifting from CeFi to DeFi completely.

The whole reason people used CeFi in the first place was convenience and low fees as opposed the ultra high Ethereum gas fees.

However, these two issues are almost fully resolved making a shift mass shift towards DeFi a much more logical decision than staying on these lying, corrupt centralized platforms.

Many DeFi platforms are becoming much more intuitive and easier to operate so that gets rid of the first issue.

The second issue, gas, is almost completely irrelevant now with L2s becoming more and more popular.

Not only are the older L2s getting better, but even some of newer ones like Mantle are showing hyper-scaling abilities in efforts to to make the Ethereum ecosystem more streamlines. Not only that but Ethereum based decentralized organizations invested a lot into it.  
Taking all of this into consideration, there‚Äôs really no excuse to choosing CeFi over DeFi especially after the various scandals that happened in the CeFi world.

The fact that centralized platforms hold this much power in a space centered around decentralization is a problem. This isn‚Äôt what Vitalik or Satoshi envisioned.,"The entire reason cryptocurrencies were created to begin with because of centralized institutions like banks and governments taking control through financial means.

These centralized exchanges and other CeFi platforms aren‚Äôt any different.

They have full control over our hard earned funds and can legally do whatever they want with them. This is not to mention that they‚Äôre regulatory compliant meaning the government can basically tell them what to do.

How did it come this far? Ethereum and its dApps are a thing for a reason.

Why use a centralized exchange when DEXs are a thing especially when you take into consideration that they come with many more perks.

The ‚ÄúDeFi is expensive‚Äù arguments had long been dead with the advent of L2s and other scaling solutions.

The OGs like Arbitrum and Optimism are there for a reason. And now you got Ethereum based organizations like BitDAO investing hundreds of millions of dollars into scaling solutions which resulted in their most recent L2 launch Mantle with hyperscalability features for dApps and Web3 tech.

I‚Äôd hate to see all of this R&D money being wasted while we invest more into centralized exchanges.

Why dont we take advantage of all of this tech and the fact that L2s have become way more powerful, and start investing in DeFi instead??

Some critics say blockchain games aren't fun to play because they focus on monetization too much,"Why do you play or do you avoid blockchain games? What is there to like or dislike?  
I've been wondering since there are not as enough players as there should be, how can crypto gaming ecosystems become more resilient?  


Some critics say blockchain games aren't fun to play because they focus on monetization too much. Would you agree with that?  


That is certainly true for some of the first-generation blockchain games, where developers were clearly more concerned with the crypto-earning aspect than with actual gameplay value.  


Since then, developers have realized that maintaining a sustainable blockchain gaming ecosystem necessitates more than just the ability to earn, it necessitates an engaging core game design and gameplay mechanics that can keep players hooked and spending time on the game, in addition to a simple desire to earn.  


I played numerous of these games because I'm a huge fan of video games and I'm always eager to try something new, there are only a few that made me entertained, Splinterlands, WAM tournaments and Axie but only at the beginning.   


Some pay-to-win games are based on unsustainable tokenomics. Another common criticism leveled at the earlier generation of play-to-earn games is that they attract players based on ""Ponzinomics,"" in which the earnings of players who joined the game earlier are dependent on the ability to sell NFTs or tokens to new players.  


How do devs expect them to have more GameFi players when most people are not familiar with basic crypto terms?",155.0,2022-11-21 16:08:17,0.89

**Frequently Asked Questions**

**Where's the best place to buy ETH?**

There are many centralized exchanges that support Ethereum. If you live in the US, the most popular exchanges are Coinbase, Gemeni and Kraken. Coinbase users can use Coinbase Pro for lower fees.

**How can I stake my ETH?**

The best way to stake your ETH: by running your own validator.

* Running your own validator requires a modern computer and 32 ETH. Visit /r/ethstaker for more details

**Why are Ethereum transaction fees so high?**

Like most blockchains, Ethereum fees are determined by supply-and-demand. The large demand to use Ethereum has pushed transaction fees quite high (however, fees were just a few cents only 2 years ago). Fees are especially high during market volatility, and during NFT drops.

**What is being done to lower Ethereum transaction fees?**

Ethereum fees are reduced by using layer-2 rollups. Rollups are scaling solutions that allow for significantly cheaper transactions, while still maintaining Ethereum's security.

Additionally, data shards will make rollups even cheaper.

While rollups are cutting-edge technology being actively developed, a number are already live on Ethereum mainnet. Visit [l2beat.com](https://l2beat.com/) to learn more about rollups.

**What's the best wallet for Ethereum?**

The most popular tool for using decentralized applications is Metamask. However, for security reasons, we recommend using a hardware wallet such as a Trezor or Ledger.

Staked ETH2,"What are your thoughts on having ETH2 still staked on Coinbase? Should I wrap it and sell it and then buy back into ETH and move to my Trezor? The price difference to wrap and sell plus the fee would be about an automatic 4% loss, which I guess really isn't too big of a deal when looking at how far ETH has fallen this year in the bear market. Still, has held up reasonable well compared to the past. Should I just forget about the 4% loss to do this and get off the exchange ASAP? It's the only thing left on Coinbase besides my little bit of ALGO, which I'm about to move as well.",44.0,2022-11-20 21:49:20,0.92
Is validator uptime actually a vulnerability signal?,"Hear me out before burning me at the stake here. There are many assumptions taken in this post (OS, clients, fallback clients, etc.) and even more edge-cases that refute my thoughts. This post is intended to shed light on a general case that may apply to many validators, if not most, given it would seem to affect vanilla validator configurations.  

&#x200B;

Validator uptime is a publicly discernable attribute through missed-attestations, and as anybody running a validator should know, critical node maintenance like security updates oftentimes require a system restart that would result in publicly viewable downtime. If I was a malicious actor that wanted to attempt to gain access to validator keys by compromising these nodes, then this uptime metric could provide me a fast and easy ""short list"" of validators that *likely* have not gone through this maintenance effort. I could even rank my list depending on how long the validator has been online, targeting nodes that *potentially* have not been restarted in months (or years) with the assumption that security exploits are more effective on these nodes..

&#x200B;

Missing a few attestations is relatively painless from a financial perspective. If a node operator is hellbent on not performing maintenance on their system for whatever reason, would it make sense to ""pay"" a few cents each month and create a script that would cut network activity to the node for a few hours at the end of every month? If it were me, I think I would pay this low cost to avoid being placed on the malicious actors short list. Then again, if it were me, I would just update my node instead...",55.0,2022-11-20 16:21:18,0.95

Who verifies the data coming from first party oracles?,"
I have been reading up on API3 and if I am not mistaken one of their distinguishing features that sets it apart from Chain.Link is the idea of 1st party oracles. Which I understand to mean the owner of the data, originate the data themselves unto the blockchain.

My question is, who verifies such 1st oracle service? Like what is stopping such 1st oracle service to collude with some other players to modify, or even delay publication of data in such a way to be beneficial to the party they are colluding with?

My understanding is this is difficult, in theory, to do with 3rd party oracles like Chain.Link since the data are independently sought and then aggregated",31.0,2022-11-19 14:15:47,0.88

How to handle moving your assets from a hacked metamask wallet,"Hey everyone, sorry but this will be a long post:
I recently got my Metamask wallet hacked for some reason, and I would like some help on figuring out how it was hacked , and how to move my tokens to a new wallet.
I'm kind of experienced in the crypto world, so I wouldn't make mistakes like sharing my passphrase or putting it in my PC, clicking on phishy links, etc. I even looked up my MM permissions on revoke.cash and I had unlimited spend enabled on Uniswap only. Are there any other ways I could have got my wallet hacked? 
2) Thankfully the hacker didn't care much about my tokens( or most likely didn't notice them at all) so I took all my USDC and USDT out from the polygon and arbitrum networks. My issue lies in the Eth mainnet, I mean I don't have much money in tokens there(less than 40$), but I still would like to move them out, even with fees being so high. I also would like to move all my NFTs from pologon to a new wallet. So is there anyway to batch-send tokens and NFTs on ethreum mainnet and polygon?
3) Could you please offer some advice on how to protect myself from MM hacks? I'm really stressed out, like I'm trying to install linux alongside windows to protect myself from viruses and whatnot, and it feels bad getting your hard earned coins robbed. 
4) I have some ETH tokens that I couldn't sell on Uniswap before getting hacked due to low liquidity. Is there anyway to know when a token can be easily tradable on Uniswap? The ones I'm talking about average 3k-5k trading volume a day on Uniswap, which is pretty low I guess. I just don't want to send some eth to my wallet and have it trapped there(cause of the fees) for the hacker to steal.

Do you think the collapse of FTX is good or bad for the blockchain ecosystem?,"Thinking about this in the long-term. A lot of people joined crypto last year and trusted centralized exchanges. The CEX with the biggest political and press backing turned out to be one of the biggest frauds in history. Obviously, this hurts us. The press is having a field day blaming crypto - ""get out while you still can!""  


Thoughts:

\- This is free advertising for the value of decentralization for anyone who is still active

\- This may lead to a renewed push for open and decentralized protocols for next cycle

\- Lots of people who got burned may never return, or not for years

\- It's likely to be ammunition for regulations

Five trends that will push the adoption of blockchain,"I was so freaked out on the ongoing saga that the collapse of FTX is dominating the crypto headlines and has led many to write off the industry for good as billions in investors' funds have evaporated with no hope of regaining what was lost.    
 

According to Alexander Filatov, a co-founder and managing partner of EverX Labs, there are five main trends that will help the blockchain space surpass 1 billion users within the next 6 to 7 years. Have you heard about it?   
 

I didn't doubt that the first of these trends is GameFi, which is obviously a popular sector that emerged during the bull market of 2021 and introduced a way for gamers to earn money doing what they love.   
 

I noticed that this year I spent the most time playing blockchain games, such as WAM tournaments. I think that it's always the most exciting thing for me when it comes to blockchain games, these NFT awards, and the chance to compete with actual players.   
 

Don't you think that one of the most influential sectors that will bring about an accelerated adoption of blockchain technology and Web3 could be Metaverse? What do you think about that?   
 

The second growing trend is an increase in tokenization and NFT utility, the third trend cited by Filatov, as more scalable networks will be required to onboard new users, and the fourth trend, which will likely lead to an influx of money and participants in the crypto economy, is an increase in government intervention and the establishment of regulations related to the use of blockchain-enabled technologies.

Ethereum turns into first profitable blockchain from Top 10 of Crypto Market,"Prior to the Merge update and the continuous reduction in issuance, Ethereum, like any cryptocurrency network on the market, was the ""unprofitable"" blockchain. However, things have changed.   
 

It's important to note that a blockchain's ""profitability"" is not the same as a company's profitability in traditional finance. Technically, subtracting new issuance from fee burns allows us to determine whether or not the network is profitable.   
 

So, as far as I can tell, the blockchain's profitability benefits neither its holders nor new investors. Deflation, on the other hand, has the potential to be a significant speculative growth factor for cryptocurrency in the future.   
 

However, while the rallying Ethereum will benefit investors and traders, dApps users and developers will be forced to make transactions with higher fees and possible network congestion. Unfortunately, during high network loads, Ethereum requires users to pay up to $15 per network operation.   
 

I remember at the beginning it was quite chaos dealing with transactions and gas fees, I started using Metis from the start, and the discovery of L2 solutions was the greatest discovery for me as far as I can tell lol.    
 

Various foundations and projects, however, are constantly working on Ethereum's scalability by offering new mechanisms for processing transactions or alternative Layer 2 networks that take some of the load off the main network, offering higher throughput, shorter processing times, and low fees.",114.0,2022-11-17 15:47:42,0.88

This is actually phase 2 in my long-suffering plan to bring automated strategies to *everyone* and even the playing field out there. I think it's a very necessary gap to close.

My first attempt, [Botchi](https://github.com/neauangle/botchi/), was a monolithic bot suite that *works* but it's complicated to use and its reliance on a GUI makes it terrible for running on a VPS. Plus, the bot designer is *fine* but programming languages really are our best tools to define logical flows. I figured it's better to focus on devs- I wrote a high-level library called [Botiq](https://www.npmjs.com/package/botiq) that makes writing crypto bots pretty easy- and then bridge the gap between developers and end-users with something like The Bot Shed.

Marketplace for Goerli Eth,"Please hear me out.¬†

This has immensely pissed me off to the point where I would pay money for Goerli Eth - obviously hugely discounted from the price of regular eth. As a result I was thinking about setting up a marketplace for Goerli Eth.¬†

Ethereum based DAOs are helping boost adoption and utilize crypto in regions like Africa and Asia. This is exactly what Ethereum was created for,"I remember how Vitalik once mentioned that the main goal behind Ethereum is to help humanity and society become more self reliant and eventually escape the grasps of tyrannical figures and institutions.

And while this still might be far from happening, it is the end goal that all of us as a community are working to eventually achieve.

It will take time but the goal is there.

If fact we‚Äôre already seeing decentralized organizations helping out the people who need self governance the most.

Many people living in certain African and Asian countries are under the full control of corrupt tyrannical governments and institutions and thus, Ethereum and Ethereum-based decentralized projects can be the most effective there.

This is very evident by the fact that the MENA region has registered the highest crypto market growth in 2022. Plus there are some Ethereum based organizations like BitDAO that are funding subdaos like AfricaDAO to help boost adoption in African regions and give the people there a taste of well needed self governance.

This is all very revolutionary, but again, this movement is still in its infancy but it‚Äôs progress nonetheless. Everything needs to start somewhere, right?

All I really care about is seeing Ethereum and all the projects and dApps built on it actually get utilized in the real world.

Future of Crypto?,"Sorry for the somewhat vague title here, but I really am interested what you all think about the future of crypto after this week‚Äôs events?

The downfall of both Terra and FTX is sure to ignite the wrath of regulators on the crypto space.

Like you all, I believe that the underlying technology behind cryptocurrencies can help to solve a myriad of societal problems. At the same time, having worked in the tech industry for two decades, it‚Äôs also clear to me that radical technologies, like the Internet and cryptocurrencies, do not always evolve in an ideal way.

What I‚Äôm particularly curious about is what a future with Crypto, CBDCs, and inevitable regulations will look like. What will be the role of crypto?

I‚Äôve been thinking about this even more recently, and my conclusion is that, barring an effective banning of crypto (which I believe is pretty much impossible at this point), crypto will serve as both a testbed and release valve for fiat policies.

Consider that Bitcoin started in response to the 2008 financial crisis and exploded in popularity due to unpopular fiat policies, particularly Quantitative Easing. It has also served as an independent safe haven for residents of nations dealing with a failed fiat currency. However, it has (so far) not lived up to the promise of a hedge against inflation.

The advent of Ethereum and unlocking of smart contracts is another great example where cryptocurrencies shined and provided a testbed for financial experiments. This would otherwise have been impossible in a strictly fiat world.

What do you think?",43.0,2022-11-14 21:50:11,0.87
ETH2 vs. cbETH,"Hi team,

In the wake of the FTX debacle I felt quite a bit of fear and skepticism around centralized exchanges. Based on that, I no longer wanted to keep my Staked ETH (ETH2) on Coinbase. In order to move it off the exchange I wrapped my staked ETH2 into the new coin created by Coinbase called Wrapped Staked ETH (cbETH) and moved it to my LedgerNanoX. My fear now is that if Coinbase halts trading or goes down for whatever reason then cbETH will go to $0. Does this make sense and should I move my cbETH back  to ETH2 and continue staking because at this point if Coinbase goes down the cbETH won't be worth anything anyway?

&#x200B;

Many thanks,

HexusD

&#x200B;

{{Update}}

&#x200B;

11/16/2022 I wrapped my staked ETH2 into cbETH. From there I was then able to send cbETH to my Ledger and import my Ledger account into MetaMask. This allowed me to bring cbETH onto MetaMask and sync on Uniswap. On Uniswap I converted my cbETH back to ETH and took the 5% hit plus a little gas. This was worth it for me because I am now completely off CEX (Coinbase) and not tied to a coin that isn't pegged to anything (cbETH). Thanks for all the suggestions, WAGMI.

Eth app idea,"I'm planning to possibly build a dapp and am wondering if anyone can help sanity check the idea.

Ultimately I'm building it because I want to see it built, and if someone else steals the idea and builds it that's fine by me. Also, if there are similar projects that already do this please link them so I can investigate.

The core concept of this is essentially a pool/prize, where people can donate money into, and with each donation they can submit a name (string), of a public figure etc.

At the end of some cyclical period. It will tally the string that gets the most 'votes'/'money' put towards it. It will then use some form of consensus algorithm (or possibly another vote,or if nothing else possibly manual trigger by some admin group) ... where the entire pool will be donated to the wallet owner of the name of the string.

The use case is very simple.

It will allow people in democratic countries to lobby (bribe but stfu) politicians in the same way corporations do.

It sets a gigantic monetary reward that every person in power can clearly SEE, and thus gives them PERSONAL financial motivation to do whatever is in their power to meet that goal.

Seeing as no-name scumbag dead projects sometimes get multi-million dollar valuations at their bubble peak; It would be cool if we could just use that as a prize pool to bait/lure the most scummy self-serving republican (or career democrat) politician to... I dunno pass public health care reform in the US not because he cares about people or the country... only because he wants that 20M directly sent to his wallet.",35.0,2022-11-14 09:09:40,0.76

**Frequently Asked Questions**

**Where's the best place to buy ETH?**

There are many centralized exchanges that support Ethereum. If you live in the US, the most popular exchanges are Coinbase, Gemeni and Kraken. Coinbase users can use Coinbase Pro for lower fees.

**How can I stake my ETH?**

The best way to stake your ETH: by running your own validator.

* Running your own validator requires a modern computer and 32 ETH. Visit /r/ethstaker for more details

**Why are Ethereum transaction fees so high?**

Like most blockchains, Ethereum fees are determined by supply-and-demand. The large demand to use Ethereum has pushed transaction fees quite high (however, fees were just a few cents only 2 years ago). Fees are especially high during market volatility, and during NFT drops.

**What is being done to lower Ethereum transaction fees?**

Ethereum fees are reduced by using layer-2 rollups. Rollups are scaling solutions that allow for significantly cheaper transactions, while still maintaining Ethereum's security.

Additionally, data shards will make rollups even cheaper.

While rollups are cutting-edge technology being actively developed, a number are already live on Ethereum mainnet. Visit [l2beat.com](https://l2beat.com/) to learn more about rollups.

**What's the best wallet for Ethereum?**

The most popular tool for using decentralized applications is Metamask. However, for security reasons, we recommend using a hardware wallet such as a Trezor or Ledger.

"Crypto gaming needs to be fun to be successful ‚Äî money doesn't matter, do you agree?","Do you think that most cryptocurrency games today lack the mechanics to keep players interested for even a short period of time?  


I read one interesting article about this and made me think why haven‚Äôt more top-tier games introduced real-world rewards into their games?   


I'm referring to titles in which 99.9% of gamers are not professional esports athletes and receive no monetary compensation for thousands of hours spent playing their favorite games. The possibility of introducing monetary incentives has always been on the table. Why hasn't it been   


Games need to avoid injecting monetary rewards into an experience that is designed to be intrinsically rewarding. The gameplay should be most important because that's the thing that keeps players attracted to the game and entertained. Have you seen how awesome WAM tournaments are? Well, that's the exact reason I'm captivated by that game, it's insane and we need more games that are fun and worth playing.  


The fact is that nobody will invest hundreds of hours in an activity that isn't fun unless it pays a lot of money. And you can only pay out a large sum of money if a large number of users collaborate to create a significant amount of value. This quickly becomes a death spiral for nascent crypto games, as the games are unable to generate enough value to adequately reward players for spending hours inside an unrewarding game loop.  


Instead of starting with economics or haphazardly adding crypto to a working game loop, developers should create games that people want to play. A play-to-earn mechanism could destroy the retention of even a fantastic game with high retention numbers.

A lesson from FTX,"It seems like the most popular takeaway after FTX has been revealed to be insolvent is that self custody is the safest way to go. However, I believe most people are overlooking the biggest concern that could be drawn from it. There were 3 giant centralized exchanges in cryptocurrency: Binance, Coinbase, and FTX. One of them is now on the edge of bankruptcy. There is a huge danger in narrowing that list to two. If a large percentage of people decide to sell after what‚Äôs happened, how can we know that Coinbase and Binance have enough liquidity to facilitate withdrawals? The gains that crypto has seen dwarf the revenue collected by exchanges. 

One of the first things that happened during the Great Depression were mass attempts to withdraw cash from banks who did not have that cash on hand. Stable coins are not a solution. If you can‚Äôt sell them, you can‚Äôt spend them. Tether limited is not a central bank. No matter how much USDT is minted, they cannot create more USD out of thin air.

I‚Äôm not trying to fear monger, but people should be more concerned and should be demanding more transparency for centralized exchanges. Hardware wallets cannot be frozen. But if centralized platforms don‚Äôt have enough cash to pay out to those who want to sell, then it completely undercuts any value proposition for cryptocurrency regardless of whatever the price is or how much your wallet is saying it‚Äôs worth.",605.0,2022-11-12 00:53:26,0.92

Its funny how so many more people are getting scammed on these ‚Äúregulated‚Äù platforms versus unregulated ones.,"DeFi has always been synonymous with ‚Äúscams‚Äù because it‚Äôs unregulated meaning there‚Äôs no central authority that can thoroughly check the legitimacy of a project before it gets listed.

This (at least in theory) should make CeFi much safer than DeFi considering there are standards to be met.

But the reality is that a lot of standards are being completely ignored. Standards that are putting billions of dollars in funds at risk as we‚Äôve seen with FTX most recently.

There‚Äôs no reason for anyone to be using CeFi over DeFi especially when you take into consideration the power of custody and the fact that DeFi is now way more efficient with L2s taking over.  
Fees on L2s like Loopring right now are minimal and other L2s like Polygon have tens of thousands of dApps to choose from. Uniswap alone is boasting huge numbers on Polygon and their zkEVM is making it much easier for developers to build and migrate contracts.

It makes literally zero sense to use CeFi over DeFi.

‚ÄúIts more convenient‚Äù well yeah up until the platform you have your money on ends up drying out your hard earned money and blocks you from accessing them since you already signed away the rights of custody‚Ä¶

"Which L2 protocol do you have the most trust in, and why?","We are all aware that, despite being the leading blockchain for developing decentralized apps, Ethereum is frequently chastised for high gas fees and slow transactions; even if the merger occurred, there are some things that should be done.  


Do you use any tools to help you deal with all of these ETH issues? Last week, I read an online article about Layer 2s, and there are a couple of great solutions, some of which I've tried and some of which I'm currently using, which is the scaling protocol Metis. It helps with all of these issues, such as high gas prices and slow transactions, which are, as previously stated, characteristics of ETH.  


Since I read about these protocols, solutions, and all the needed help with problems we're dealing with using ETH, I'd like to know a little bit more about it from your personal experience.  


Are you satisfied with the Merge after some time has passed? What did you expect, and did it meet your expectations? How do you deal with all of the other ETH issues that every holder/trader faces?  


I should mention that the Metis platform has a variety of use cases, including assisting users in developing their own NFT minting, yield farming, which I've been using as well, and DEX, which is fantastic, so there are some reasons why this platform appears trustworthy to me.

Zero-Knowledge Proofs application in Ethereum,"Ethereum is a public ledger and by its design, it‚Äôs meant to be transparent. However, there is confusion about it being anonymous because many people still believe that the blockchain in general is anonymous, which is false. Anything can be tracked on the ledger, including the details of every transaction and deal you‚Äôve made since you started trading. It may not be a big deal to some, especially to those who don‚Äôt understand that their personal privacy can easily be violated as a result of this. 

People are starting to realize that there is a big privacy gap in crypto. This has been amplified by the disturbing push for the adoption of CBDCs by the government which will give them some level of control over the finances of the general masses. Zero-Knowledge proofs have been cited by many to be revolutionary, especially when it comes to building privacy tools.

ZKPs are encryption schemes in which a party who is a prover proves their case of truth concerning specific data on the other party,a verifier without revealing the information. Here are few of the projects that have worked around the technology to build an important utility- privacy in crypto.  

1. Aztec offers users privacy utilizing layer 2 solutions, specifically the zk rollups system. Users send transaction requests to Aztec and the transactions are then put into a batch, and rolled up with other users' transactions, which can lead to a longer processing time but has privacy baked in at a base layer. 
2. Railgun is a privacy-preserving smart contract wallet developed on Ethereum and uses zk-SNARKs to obfuscate transaction details and make anonymous transactions of any Erc 20 tokens or Erc 721 tokens. Users also get privacy at rest, meaning they can keep a private balance which wasn‚Äôt possible on previous L1 privacy protocols.It works by removing all identifying information from transactions. It‚Äôs similar to a MetaMask or any other wallet, just with privacy preserving zk-SNARKs in place.
3. Zether is a confidential (transaction amounts are hidden) and anonymous (transaction sender and receiver are hidden) payment mechanism on blockchains with an account model like Ethereum. It is implemented as a smart contract called ZSC. One of the major limitations that Zether is known for is that transactions get processed at the end of a current epoch, inferring that it can be quite difficult on a busy network. However, it is quite promising and has everything it takes to be among the major players in private crypto overtime. 

I believe that there are many other ways to keep a private balance on Ethereum. As a privacy maxi, I would love to hear this subreddit‚Äôs thoughts on what‚Äôs out there in this area.  A time will come when privacy will become a big word in crypto and we‚Äôll have the bulk of crypto users keeping their on-chain activities private.",51.0,2022-11-10 09:25:37,0.87

"Decentralised Social Network growing rapidly, without us.","These past weeks have been quite extraordinary. Everyone around me has been talking about decentralisation, except the crypto folks.

The federated social network and microblogging system [Mastodon](https://joinmastodon.org/) has been growing at an incredible rate as users migrate away from Twitter.

We see that it crossed
6,132,414 users today and is growing at over 5k/hour. See here for stats:
https://bitcoinhackers.org/@mastodonusercount

Thousands of new instances are being set up. See also [this](https://mastodon.social/@0xDUDE/109299721722276122).

This is quite phenomenal for a decentralised, federated network running on open source software, where anyone can run their own ~~node~~ instance.

Academics are coordinating to move to mastodon en masse. Journalists too are moving. A lot of effort is going in to this and a lot of experimentation / hands-on improvisation: They are even passing around text files and [google](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1rNfUosPSiMwRbUAbnI3h-7D9grP6ULgS/) [docs] (https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/13No4yxY-oFrN8PigC2jBWXreFCHWwVRTftwP6HcREtA/) full of account names so that people can recreate their twitter networks on mastodon.

This week has seen articles on mastodon in general and on how to get set up in [wired](https://www.wired.com/story/how-to-find-twitter-friends-on-mastodon/), [wired2](https://www.wired.com/story/join-mastodon-twitter-alternative/), [the guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/media/2022/nov/01/mastodon-twitter-elon-musk-takeover), [time](https://time.com/6229230/mastodon-eugen-rochko-interview/), [nytimes](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/11/07/technology/mastodon-twitter-elon-musk.html), [bbc](https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-63534240), [thejournal](https://www.thejournal.ie/what-is-mastodon-and-how-do-i-join-it-ireland-5912976-Nov2022/), [sz](https://www.sueddeutsche.de/wirtschaft/mastodon-twitter-netzwerk-dezentral-1.5574623), and so many more.. 

The trigger for this has been the turmoil at Twitter. But whatever the cause, and whatever you think about Elon Musk making Twitter his personal property, I would have expected this community to be excited about a mass movement to Mastodon, and actively encouraging it / joining in. Surely this community understands that a decentralised social network in which moderation is local/opt-in, in which you can move your account to another node at any time and keep your followers, in which you can run your own node, that this is an extremely valuable thing in itself, and that it opens the space up to so much more development, improvement, and experimentation.

Instead, I find that among my followings, everyone except the crypto crowd is trying to decentralise while this community just shrugs.

It might not be a web3 utopia, but its a lot better than one privately owned network. Here is a chance to move things in the right direction... and yet ..

Why? 
Shouldn't we give it a go? Try it out? 
It's open source. Adding ENS authentication is [one PR away](https://github.com/mastodon/mastodon). Adding IPFS/Swarm support is [one PR away](https://github.com/mastodon/mastodon). We can even [host our own instances](https://docs.joinmastodon.org/user/run-your-own/) to experiment while still being connected to the wider network.

I'd love to see you all over there!

Ethereum's Layer 2 ecosystem is undeniably growing,"Ethereum is notorious for being prohibitively slow and costly. At the height of cryptocurrency's most recent hype cycle, something as simple as exchanging one token for another on the blockchain could have cost upwards of $40.  


It's no surprise that L2 protocols have grown in popularity, so there are layer 2 rollups for those who want to keep their transactions within the Ethereum ecosystem, and there's a reason why Metis and other L2 solutions have become so popular.  


Layer 2 rollups have special systems in place to ensure that transactions aren't spoofed or altered before being sent back to Ethereum's main chain, which is pretty cool.

"If we ever want DeFi to go mainstream, L2s should be a major focus point for everyone.","I‚Äôm saying this because DeFi is notorious for having high gas fees and long waiting times versus the very cheap and fast operations of CeFi.

Of course, with CeFi, you‚Äôre trading custody of your own coins for that speed and cheap gas which is extremely bad for the future of crypto as a whole.

Look at what SBF is pushing for example. It awful.

We NEED more adoption when it comes to DeFi because by the way I see it, if we keep up this pace then CeFi will soon take over.

This is exactly why I think L2s are critical for the future of DeFi as a whole. They are the only way for dApps to scale and thus gain more users daily.

We‚Äôre already starting to see a push in terms of development from L2s. DeFi has become extremely cheaper on them, especially with L2 like Loopring.

Other L2s like Polygon ended up developing an open source zkEVM has proven to be successful with developers using it to build more dApps in a much easier and cheaper way. You can see this with Polygon already having some of the major dApps like Aave, Uniswap, Curve, Aavegotchi, Decentraland, and many more.

We cant expand DeFi to go full mainstream if it remains expensive, and although we‚Äôre seeing A LOT of improvements in that regard, we still need to keep it up.

I think that the upcoming Ethereum updates to the PoS chain will definitely help and give DeFi a boost but ultimately, it is up to the L2s to find new and more advanced way to make DeFi cheaper.",35.0,2022-11-03 13:18:43,0.85

Barclays & other banks are using intrusive AML type calls to veil their market research into crypto & 3rd party custody demand - Just got the weirdest legit ''Fraud Prevention'' call,"I've just had the weirdest, legitimate Barclays call after i tried to deposit money to an exchange - **It was 100% Barclays as well - checked the number & the money has landed on my exchange now**

**Only logical explanation i can think of is that Barclays are now conducting market research on their customers who send money to crypto exchanges in preparation for offering custody services. I'm guessing it'll be packaged in some way to make it more palatable to their wealthy clients, perhaps an ''ISA'' type account or some form of passive fund where Barclays/Copper take custody**

5.5 years of sending money from my bank account to Kraken, I've never had one e-mail or call to verify anything, let alone any fraud prevention calls.

I send a small sum as a test transaction - **lands in on the exchange in minutes**

I send ¬£2000 to the same address 10 mins later **& receive a call IMMEDIATELY**

Some of the questioning was just odd & very intrusive, but has never ever happened before.

The anti-fraud stuff i understand asking **my details & ''where are you sending this & how did you fund it ''** etc but then, proceeded to ask me, **what was basically a market research questionnaire that I was emphatically told was ''necessary to clear the funds'' but in hindsight wasn't at all & the lady backed down & cleared the funds.** 

&#x200B;

* **''So, what crypto coin are you buying...?''** \- excuse me? what relevance does that have? maybe i'm sending it to the exchange so i have liquid cash ready to deploy in future? that is so intrusive. All you need to know is that, yes it is me sending it & i know the account im sending it to....the lady asked me multiple times & **said the funds wouldn't be cleared** until i refused outright & suddenly it wasn't **''necessary''** anymore?

&#x200B;

* **''Do you use a 3rd party to buy crypto''** \- what on earth has this got to do with anything?

&#x200B;

* **''How much research do you conduct before you buy cryptocurrencies?'**' - again, what?

These are all perfectly reasonable questions for a voluntary questionnaire, not a stressful ''fraud prevention'' call because you've locked my funds & wont release until i declare my investment thesis & timings???

The above link makes a lot more sense now in hindsight & I've never been more convinced banks like Barclays are edging closer to becoming a ''trusted'' 3rd party for their customers to gain exposure to crypto, without having to actually custody the assets themselves. **This is HUGE for institutional investors & lo and behold, Barclays now own a large stake in a UK, crypto, custody company. They're currently conducting research to ascertain what level of demand there is for different cryptos & how willing their customers are to use a ''3rd party''**

>A 29-year-old man died Friday morning after being swept away by sea currents on the beach behind Ashford Hospital in County, the Police Bureau said.

>According to a police report, the incident was reported at 9:15 a.m. when authorities were alerted that the man, identified as Nicolai Arcadie Muchgian, had been dragged.

>Rescue personnel managed to rescue his body that no longer showed vital signs, it was reported. 

>According to the authorities, the injured party was a resident of San Juan. 

>Agent Rosario, assigned to the Isla Verde Tourist Precinct, was in charge of the complaint.

The reason gas prices have been declining for the past 4 quarters despite having over 100% gas usage,"####**The Enigma**

One interesting curiosity I've noticed is that **Ethereum gas prices have been falling 20-40% each quarter since EIP-1559 initiated DESPITE gas usage being over the 100% 15M target gas usage.**

This is surprising because normally under EIP-1559, if each block stays exactly at the 100% gas target, gas price will also stay exactly the same.

|**Date**|**Block Time**|**Blocks**|**Gas % used**|**Gas Price (Gwei)**|**Notes**|

|2020 Year|13|6480|67%|60||
|2021 Q1|13|6503|80%|150||
|2021 Q2|13|6463|92%|87||
|2021 Q3|13|6430|99%|67|EIP-1559 introduced|
|2021 Q4|13|6370|**102%**|**117**||
|2022 Q1|13|6454|**101%**|**95**||
|2022 Q2|14|6112|**101%**|**59**||
|2022 Q3|13|6482|**101%**|**21**||
|2022 Oct|12|7157|102%|23|Post-Merge|

####**So why is this happening?**

This counter-intuitive phenomenon can be explained by simple math. After EIP-1559, gas price changes whenever the previous block's gas usage deviates from 15M gas. It increases by 12.5% at 30M gas, and decreases by 12.5% at 0M gas. Any value between the 2 limits affects price proportionally up to 12.5%.

**So what happens if a 30M-gas block were followed by a 0M-gas block?**

    (x+a) * (x-a) = x^2 - a^2
    (1 + 0.125) * (1 - 0.125) = 98.4% => 2.6% price decrease

Thus if a 30M-gas block were followed by a 0M-gas block, the gas price would still fall 2.6% even though the average gas usage stays at 15M gas. The larger the volatility from the 15M-gas target, the larger the negative price pressure.

**In fact, in an extreme theoretical case where there were one full day of 30M-gas blocks followed by another full day of 0M-gas blocks, the gas price on the 3rd day would be 10^50 times smaller despite that the average usage between the 2 days was still 15M gas**. Obviously, validators will not magically be able to process transactions 10^50 times cheaper, so this is completely theoretical.

**Nevertheless, the effect is there, and we have been experiencing a 20-40% decrease in gas prices quarterly since EIP-1559 was introduced in Aug 2021. Though the decrease has slowed down since The Merge.**

A mix of these 2 cases will continue happening until a dynamic market equilibrium is reached:

1. Gas price keeps falling every quarter
1. Daily gas usage rises noticeably above its current 102% average. (Edit: I did some simulations afterwards. Gas usage actually remains around 102-103% of 15M when the price remains stable. So it's actually not as noticeable as I thought.)

------------------------

**Edit**: I thought about it more, and it does seem to either be a bug or a purposeful design flaw.

Let's say you have 3 fee changes of a, b, and c where the sum of all 3 is zero. You have to find a fee formula f(x) where the product, f(a) * f(b) * f(c) = 1.

So I figured out the correct formula is to use any exponential function. For example:

    a + b = -c
    e^a * e^b * e^c = e^a * e^b * e^(-a-b) = 1

I was going to report it, but looks like **someone else** already mentioned it a long time ago: https://ethresear.ch/t/make-eip-1559-more-like-an-amm-curve/9082/2

Guess they never bothered fixing it.

"Ethereum has become extremely sustainable. For reference, YouTube spends 244 TW/yr meanwhile Ethereum PoS spends 0.004% that number.","The reason I chose something like YouTube is because its somewhat tech related in comparison to something like gold mining (which uses up around 240 TW/yr).

In fact, lets mention other tech and Web2 related things like Netflix and the US gaming industry which spend 94 and 34 TW/yr respectively.

Ethereum has come a long way from 112 to 0.01 which is ground breaking progress honestly. This will allow more and more companies and institutions to move into the Web3 space and start building on Ethereum without having to worry anymore about the sustainability issues that the blockchain used to suffer from.

This is major news for mainstream adoption considering that these companies joining the Web3 space will give Ethereum great exposure.

Sure, gas fees will still remain high for now but many projects, dApps, and companies as well are resorting to L2s.

Polygon for example has been a major contributor to the Ethereum ecosystem inviting companies like Facebook, Instagram, Starbucks and many more. And with the zkEVM testnet launched, many devs are finding it easier to build on Ethereum through Polygon.

Think about it, Ethereum still has a lot of upgrades on the way yet we‚Äôre already seeing some mainstream companies and brands building a Web3 presence for themselves on it. Imagine the impact on adoption that the upcoming upgrades will have.

I said it once and I‚Äôll say it again. Going PoS was an extremely smart move of Ethereum to do. It laid the infrastructure for a chain that will withstand the test of time and prove its sustainability and efficiency.",307.0,2022-10-29 18:49:59,0.75

"To quote Mihailo Bjelic: ‚ÄúIf you can't see and verify the code, it's not safe and it's not Ethereum‚Äù","Ethereum is a community led network. The main goal behind Ethereum is for people to be able to self-govern so it should come as a given that anything built on Ethereum and willing to follow its main core and values, should have an open source code.

That‚Äôs it, there are no loopholes. There are no exceptions. There are no if, and, or buts.

An application, network, or rollup that retains the value of Ethereum should retain open source code

Just because a rollup **\*claims\*** to follow EVM equivalence doesn‚Äôt automatically mean that it truly does.

Take ZkSync for example. They are constantly being criticized by the community and especially rivaling developers for the fact that they claim to have ‚Äúthe first ever zkEVM‚Äù when in reality no one even knows if it even works. The code is completely closed source which is a big non amongst developers.

This is actually the main reason behind Mihailo Bjelic‚Äôs tweet (the title of this post).

Mihailo is one of the leading developers at Ethereum scaling solution, Polygon. So it wouldn‚Äôt come as a surprise that there‚Äôs some rivalry between him and the ZkSync team.

However, when confronted about having a closed source zkEVM versus Polygon‚Äôs open source, some ZkSync supporters started coming up with excuses and fork accusations all of which were shut down by what I think is any Ethereum community member could have said. Mihailo stated:

***‚ÄúOpen source code and verifiability are some of the core Ethereum values.***

***Polygon zkEVM (and everything else we build) follows these values.***

***The community needs to demand this from every scaling project. If you can't see and verify the code, it's not safe and it's not Ethereum.‚Äù***  


Regardless of whether it was Polygon, Scroll, Zksync, Loopring, Arbitrum, Optimism, or any other rollup, this statement should be applied.

As I said, there should never be an excuse as to why your code is closed source on Ethereum. This is a network that is led by the community and is constantly getting improved and protected by said community as well.

If this community cannot access your code, you are technically violating everything Ethereum stands for.",158.0,2022-10-25 23:09:00,0.92
We need a function within ETH to timeout transactions that are in pending hell,"So I just dealt with a transaction in pending hell because I made a mistake. In doing research I found 

1. this actually happens to a lot of people. Mostly newer, but at the rate of people running into this. It isn't something you can walk backwards in.
2. the current no timeout system makes it less user-friendly. 

&#x200B;

# Solution:

A simple solution is a timeout function within ETH that you can opt out from. So basically, if a transaction has been in pending hell for a week or 2 (after x blocks) mark it as dropped.

&#x200B;

What could happen is there could be a way to opt out. Like if the transaction says ""no timeout"" then it opts out. On metamask or whatever this can be done mostly on the backend and this gives the user the ability to use some checkbox or whatever if they wanted to opt out of this. 

If you opt out then it should basically do what it does now. 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Beyond this obviously the guides will have to be updated, and people will have to be inform the average transaction after x date will timeout after a week or 2. The person can override the transaction like they do now if they didn't want to wait or they opt out.",29.0,2022-10-25 17:00:45,0.76
Looking for developer feedback on our new no-code blockchain filtering tool!," Hey blockchain fam,

A lot of developers we spoke with pointed out that almost every Web3 project requires meaningful blockchain activity to be ingested into a centralized backend programmatically. This can take a while and be rather tedious.

**Frequently Asked Questions**

**Where's the best place to buy ETH?**

There are many centralized exchanges that support Ethereum. If you live in the US, the most popular exchanges are Coinbase, Gemeni and Kraken. Coinbase users can use Coinbase Pro for lower fees.

**How can I stake my ETH?**

The best way to stake your ETH: by running your own validator.

* Running your own validator requires a modern computer and 32 ETH. Visit /r/ethstaker for more details

**Why are Ethereum transaction fees so high?**

Like most blockchains, Ethereum fees are determined by supply-and-demand. The large demand to use Ethereum has pushed transaction fees quite high (however, fees were just a few cents only 2 years ago). Fees are especially high during market volatility, and during NFT drops.

**What is being done to lower Ethereum transaction fees?**

Ethereum fees are reduced by using layer-2 rollups. Rollups are scaling solutions that allow for significantly cheaper transactions, while still maintaining Ethereum's security.

Additionally, data shards will make rollups even cheaper.

While rollups are cutting-edge technology being actively developed, a number are already live on Ethereum mainnet. Visit [l2beat.com](https://l2beat.com/) to learn more about rollups.

**What's the best wallet for Ethereum?**

The most popular tool for using decentralized applications is Metamask. However, for security reasons, we recommend using a hardware wallet such as a Trezor or Ledger.

Regarding the common(usual) payment method of Ethereum,

1. It doesn't have to be like that at all. The present state is sufficient.
2. It is a desirable, but not urgent issue to do so.
3. It must be so.

the best way to measure and compare different off-chain scaling solutions,"Hey guys!

Recently, I read lots of different articles about scaling solutions and in the next semester, I have the opportunity to make my thesis about this topic.

My first idea about it is that it is easier and more obvious to focus on only off-chain scaling solutions on top of Ethereum. My personal opinion is that it is really hard to define the set of on-chain scaling solutions and the comparison and the measurement will be harder because usually, these different approaches mean different blockchain ecosystems.

My plan is to choose implementations from each different off-chain scaling type (sidechains, validiums, plasma chains, optimistic rollups, zero-knowledge rollups, and state channels) and compare them to each other. The comparison is based on security, decentralization, and scalability examination.

The decentralization examination is based on three metrics Gini coefficient, Shannon entropy, and Nakamoto coefficient. The scalability examination is based on the transaction cost, throughput and latency. Maybe, I could also examine the message and time complexity like in a distributed system. I do not know what will be the best metric for security yet. 

What do you think is the best way to compare different off-chain solutions from security, scalability, and decentralization points of view? And what is your about this kind of paper?

What's the significance of the Fireblocks integration? Fireblocks is a major player in institutional crypto custody. They have over 1500 customers and $100M in ARR. However, most digital asset custody is happening with crypto assets. The market cap for crypto assets is \~$1T. The TASE solution will digitize traditional bonds (non-crypto assets) which represents much larger \~$100T global bond market cap.

We tried tying together some thoughts that have been floating around the community with some original takes into a coherent thesis:

\- To fully enjoy the massive improvements in data capacity ([EIP-4844](https://www.eip4844.com/) and [Sharding](https://ethereum.org/en/upgrades/sharding/)), applications will need a significant increase in computational scalability.

\- The best way to scale computation is rollups. The best kind of rollups for this purpose are application-specific optimistic rollups with interactive dispute resolutions.

\- These designs allow us to explore different execution environments: helping us to tackle deep programmability issues.

\- The design space around execution environments is massive and can help us integrate efficiently with all the infrastructure previously built for web2.

\- Data capacity + computational capacity + improved programmability = a significant increase in the kinds of applications that our industry can support.

The Last Frontier of Crypto Is Getting Out From Under CeFi Offramp Completely,"I think ultimately the key manner in which the US will bully european countries and other G20 countries into compliance with protocol censorship is through the abuse of offramps.

>67% is enough to fork non compliant validators of the network and the minority fork will not be listed on compliant exchanges.  
>  
>The entire ethereum eco system has 0 dex's with fiat on/off ramps. The censorship resistant minority fork would have to rely on bitcoin dex's like hodlhodl, bisq or robosats to onboard new users.

In other posts I have pointed out that this is primarily what they did with Panama Papers, so the Offramp are key

Offramp are how you ban entire tokens, and more importantly it's how you ban entire smart contracts. The US's main strategy in the works seems to be attacking and fragmenting liquidity and blacklisting entire smart contracts, they will primarily abuse offramps and anything without base layer privacy, though I think increasingly the US may not allow monero deposits, EU may not either.

I think BISQ is our prototype for how this all needs to be done. In some sense BISQ isn't really anonymous, it certainly involves banks and KYC. However we are missing the point with the behavior of the US

They do what they do because they are ""Cronys"", they abuse aml/kyc policy to enforce unattainable licensing, to restrict financial freedom for normal citizens (I'll let you infer this politically). 

Crypto's achilles heel is the western legal language surrounding custodianship, and indeed property is 9/10ths the law and most of Western regulatory law is obsessed with custodianship. 

Financial, political, and civil freedom comes from \*being able to access products and smart contracts that Centralized Exchanges will not list, and being able to cash out your profits for hard currency\* 

So they are going to make sure we can't cash out, that's always been their plan, abuse Offramps with Chainalysis & warrantless surveilance, and bully UN countries with threats of Treasury Designation.

I believe ultimately we need something like Strike, something people in developing nations can use to send actual currency to banks in the US and EU, that peer to peer bank transfers between emerging markets and the West need to be normalized.

And we are only becoming more reliant upon them. See Strike for Bitcoin or even things like Alchemy, OpenSea, Binance, AWS, or the APIs.

If the tools are centralized than what good does it do if the base is decentralized? OpenSea can just de-list your NFT or Alchemy can block access to certain dapps. Than why even use a decentralized blockchain if it's not actually ""decentralized""

DeFi isn‚Äôt hard to learn. People simply never had to understand ROIs and APYs. The banks used to do all the work for us.,"DeFi always comes off as ‚Äúcomplicated‚Äù and ‚Äúhard to learn‚Äù but the reality is it‚Äôs not nearly as hard of a concept as traditional finance is. In fact, I‚Äôd argue that it‚Äôs much simpler.

However, we never really needed to understand how finance works in the first place because that has always been the job of the banks and financial institutions. This is how they were able to get away with scamming so many people with hard to pay loans like the notorious student loans and new car loans.

But because there isn‚Äôt any centralized authority to take care of the processes needed to complete DeFi transactions, we need to do everything on our own which means that we need to learn every single detail needed to finish said transactions without f-ing up.

It is extremely important for the Ethereum community to fully understand this because a lot of people (especially the newbies) are very intimidated by DeFi and end up resorting to centralized finance instead, which overall hurts the DeFi space.

DeFi is starting to become more and more user-friendly with many dApps like AAVE and Curve improving the UI and UX.

It‚Äôs also becoming developer-friendly which I think is of major significance for multiple reasons. zkEVMs will be game changers for developers and the one Polygon launched yesterday is proof. Devs can now use their zkEVM to migrate contracts and simply copy paste their code with ease. The fact that it‚Äôs open source also gives it more room for improvement.

And it‚Äôs not just them, other L2s like Loopring and Scroll are also working on launching zkEVMs. In fact ZkSync already has a zkEVM testnet. The only problem with it is that its closed source or simply doesnt exist.  
But regardless, all of this combined effort from these L2s will give developers much better building tools and techniques all of which directly impacts the user experience.  


I hope that with the developers‚Äô jobs becoming easier and simpler, the average user will start seeing a difference in the DeFi space with an increased user experience.

I bet that even a decent number of those who use DeFi still dont fully understand how it works and that will definitely be a problem if we ever want to go mainstream.

The reason these banks and financial institutions became popular and eventually became an integral part of society and the economy is because of the ease of use they provide, and I think DeFi developers should learn from this and work their hardest to make imitate this one way or another even though I know its an extremely hard job to do.",140.0,2022-10-12 08:27:19,0.79
Vitalik‚Äôs view on zkEVM and its impact on Ethereum‚Äôs future as a blockchain:,"I‚Äôve already posted a similar post here although it didn‚Äôt contain as much detail so I‚Äôm expanding on this one and going into further detail

There‚Äôs been a flurry of recent developments in the zero-knowledge sector on Ethereum with some L2s even launching zkEVM testnets which enticed me to rewrite about this subject.

Again, ZK is still incredibly new tech and not many fully understand it (and this is normal considering it‚Äôs a very complicated concept to fully grasp)

Although getting to understand the technology entirely involves complicated coding knowledge and references that not many will understand, I‚Äôll try my best to break down the tech without delving too deep into complex terminology

A couple of months back Vitalik shared his thoughts about zkEVMs and the difference that comes with each level. So let‚Äôs dissect his thoughts into a somehow-brief post so that people on this sub better understand ZK tech and zkEVM:

We need to first understand the different levels that zkEVMs come in and how each level has its own pros and cons

# -Type 1 (fully Ethereum-equivalent):

Type 1 ZK-EVMs strive to be fully and uncompromisingly Ethereum-equivalent.

***The pros:***

Devs don‚Äôt have to double check the code when they migrate contracts. They can literally just copy paste

***The cons:***

Firstly, this creates a sort of laziness for devs because regardless of whether there‚Äôs 100% equivalence or not, a good dev should always double check their work

The second and more important disadvantage is that it is extremely slow compared to other types of zkEVMs. ‚ÄúEthereum was not originally designed around ZK-friendliness, so there are many parts of the Ethereum protocol that take a large amount of computation to ZK-prove. Type 1 aims to replicate Ethereum exactly, and so it has no way of mitigating these inefficiencies‚Äù Vitalik concluded.

# -Type 2 (fully EVM-equivalent):

‚ÄúType 2 ZK-EVMs strive to be exactly EVM-equivalent, but not quite Ethereum-equivalent‚Äù Vitalik said. This basically means that from a developer‚Äôs point of view, a Type 2 zkEVM looks and acts exactly like Ethereum but with underlying minute changes. These changes are there to make the development process much easier and extremely faster than what Type 1 zkEVM would offer.

This is the main difference. Its basically there to solve the main issue of Ethereum being slow and inefficient but not altering the Ethereum code (at least not entirely)

Some major names developing such tech are Polygon and Zksync (although they differ slightly)

Polygon actually just released their zkEVM testnet a couple of hours ago which was one of the reasons that made me revisit this subject.

So now both Polygon and Zksync have zkEVM testnets but I think it‚Äôs known by now that I‚Äôm one to lean more towards Polygo for multiple reasons

First of all, Polygon‚Äôs zkEVM testnet is fully open source meaning that literally anyone can access it and even improve upon it.

Zksync‚Äôs zkEVM, although an impressive feat, is still closed source which I think completely defeats the purpose of a zkEVM in the first place

Another reason is that Polygon‚Äôs zkEVM is at Bytecode-level which is unlike any other zkEVM as of now. To shorten this and not get too technical, a Bytecode-level zkEVM aims to interpret EVM Bytecode. Polygon Hermez is currently bytecode equivalent. They run that bytecode using a custom zkASM of their own. This enables direct compatibility with already existing dApps. Those dApps should be able to run without any sort of problem since they are completely bytecode equivalent (not Ethereum equivalent though). This would be extra work for the nodes to put in to validate and write the block that isn't equivalent but it really shouldn‚Äôt be a problem.

Scroll and Consensys are also working on Bytecode equivalent zkEVMs however they‚Äôre still a work in progress.

***The pros:***

This type of zkEVM is much faster than the first type we talked about. It is more than 99% equivalent with Ethereum so it's safe to say that they are **\*\*almost\*\*** (but not entirely) the same which would make things much easier for devs to work with compared to the next types that I will talk about in a bit

***The cons:***

Remember how I said that this type is more than 99% compatible with Ethereum? Well, that extra 1% is modifications that are there to improve prover time.

The main drawback however is that while these modifications do indeed improve said prover time, they also do not solve every problem. The slowness from having to prove the EVM as-is, with all of the inefficiencies and ZK-unfriendliness inherent to the EVM, still remains.

# -Type 3 (almost EVM-equivalent):

This type is very similar to the previously mentioned type 2 however it sacrifices even more equivalence in order to improve prover times even more

***The pros:***

Faster than the previously mentioned

***The cons:***

A Type 3 ZK-EVM aims to be compatible with **\*\*most\*\*** applications. They require very minimal rewriting for the rest. However, there will always be applications that need to be completely rewritten.

# -Type 4 (high-level-language equivalent)

This type of EVM is arguably the most popular right now.

What it basically means is that it takes a high level coding language (like Vyper or Solidity) and transpile it down to a SNARK-friendly VM.

A close analogy would be finding two languages of similar roots (Spanish and Portuguese) and translating one to another.

Some of the major names that use this type of EVM are Matterlabs, and Starkware.

***The pros:***

Extremely fast prover times.

‚ÄúThere is a lot of overhead that you can avoid by not ZK-proving all the different parts of each EVM execution step, and starting from the higher-level code directly‚Äù as Vitalik noted about this type of EVM

***The cons:***

This type of EVM can‚Äôt compile all sorts of applications. This means that developers will have to rewrite A LOT of smart contracts and code them back from scratch.

I think I‚Äôll end the post here. There are of course many more details to be studied and talked about however I‚Äôm pretty sure that not many would be familiar with the keywords and I personally think that this is more than enough for a normal Ethereum user to get a general idea of what zkEVM is and what it does

Delving deeper into detail would be overkill unless you‚Äôre a developer or want to be one. If that‚Äôs the case then sure knock yourself out and study more about Ethereum, Bytecode, zkEVM, and Solidity

I really hope that this post helps some of you in the community understand and appreciate Ethereum and the various L2s trying to improve the blockchain.

Gary Gensler is not going to save crypto,">Prior to his public service, Gensler worked at Goldman Sachs, where he became a partner in the Mergers & Acquisition department, headed the firm‚Äôs Media Group, led fixed income & currency trading in Asia, and was co-head of Finance, responsible for the firm's worldwide Controllers and Treasury efforts.

[https://www.sec.gov/biography/gary-gensler](https://www.sec.gov/biography/gary-gensler)

There is nothing good about crypto for the banks. It is 100% the competition. Their entire business model relies on crypto being unsuccessful. Thus, this charade that Gensler is somehow going to save crypto is Imo nothing more than the usual psyops that the bankers put out to convince the masses that they have an ally. Gensler is more akin to a trojan horse; but, that would require the SEC to be a crypto-friendly group in the first place.

Its only a matter of time before they strike a firm blow against a significant amount of cryptos. The CFTC continues to say that $ETH and $BTC are commodities; but, the majority of cryptos are up-in-the-air. Gensler and the SEC will eventually set their sights on the banks' competitors.

"If everyone actually went though the hassle of learning about DeFi, we wouldn‚Äôt have CeFi in the first place","Sure, for now, we still need centralized exchanges for on-ramping and off-ramping. But that doesn‚Äôt justify why CeFi TVL is so freaking huge when DeFi is a way more superior means of finance.

CeFi works in a way that is completely opposite to what crypto was created to serve in the first place.

The reason cryptocurrencies became a thing 13 years ago was to get rid of central authority controlling our capital the way they see fit.

By investing in centralized finance, we‚Äôre literally making the concept of crypto irrelevant.

But still, people invest in CeFi anyway because they‚Äôre either too intimidated or too lazy to learn about DeFi in the first place. Sure, there are many complicated things to learn about and mistakes are usually irreversible but once you get the hang of it you have full access to the benefits that DeFi can provide all of which isn‚Äôt available with CeFi.

Then there are people who talk about how CeFi has cheaper fees but I think this argument is slowly becoming more and more irrelevant and redundant simply because L2s are doing a great job scaling the DeFi space and are only getting better day by day.  


Many of the major DeFi applications are resorting to L2s.  
Some of the most popular ones are Polygon, housing over 37,000 dApps with some like AAVE, Curve, Uniswap, and Quickswap.

They‚Äôre all benefiting from all the scaling solutions offered by Polygon.

Overall, DeFi is just superior to CeFi in every shape or form so it doesn‚Äôt make sense for so many people to use CeFi.

The main reason they do so is exactly as mentioned in the title. They don‚Äôt want to go through the hassle of learning even though it ends up paying off incredibly.",30.0,2022-10-08 00:16:26,0.7
"Major universities like Harvard, Oxford, and MIT are entering the Web3 scene through Ethereum DAOs.

This is a major start and could spark into something bigger in the later months and years.

These are the most important and prestigious universities in the world after all and thus have a major impact and influence on other universities.

Harvard Blockchain, Blockchain at Berkeley, Blockchain at Michigan, Berkley RDI, MIT Sloan Blockchain and Oxford Blockchain Society all chose to build their courses on Ethereum through EduDAO all of which is being funded by Bitdao.

The fact that BitDAO, an Ethereum based DAO is funding these educational courses is huge! This is EXACTLY what Vitalik dreamed of in the first place.

Yeah you could technically build anything on Ethereum from memes, to NFTs, to dApps, but Vitalik‚Äôs main priority was for Ethereum to serve us and further us as humans.

If more universities start following suit and this becomes some sort of a trend, mainstream adoption will be closer than we really thought.

Think about it this way. The students learning in these universities will soon become the working members of this society and will be the ones controlling how our society is heading.

I live in a part of the world where staking/rewards on Coinbase and other CEX is not allowed/available.  I'd like to stake it on a DeFi platform and which remains in my custody.

Rising to power and maintaining that power are two completely different yet equally hard tasks. And Ethereum is doing both tasks perfectly,"What helped bring Ethereum to these heights is its exceptional and unparalleled ecosystem. And in my opinion, the thing keeping Ethereum in these heights are L2s

The reason I stress on the importance of L2s is because Ethereum is stuck in a dilemma.

The more successful and popular Ethereum becomes, the more users and activities it will acquire daily. But that in turn will slow down the network which would then make it lose users and activity.

With L2s being introduced, this issue is slowly but surely fading into obscurity day by day.

This is the main reason why the Ethereum development team ended up changing the roadmap to one that focuses a lot of L2s being implemented into the network.

 We‚Äôre already seeing unprecedented development for L2s especially the zero-knowledge sector.

A lot of L2s are focusing on ZK especially ones like Polygon after they started developing their open source zkEVM. Yet they still have other solutions that focus on Optimistic rollups as well.

These L2s have proven to be extremely popular as well considering that the aforementioned Polygon is currently nearing 175 million unique addresses.

Technically speaking, Ethereum will never escape Vitalik‚Äôs trilemma, but practically speaking, L2s will act as an outside extension to help solve this problem.

What L2s will do ensure that Ethereum keeps its high level of decentralization and security while still being fast and cheap.

The main thing pushing people away from DeCi is that you need weeks of research to merely start understanding it. But with CeFi anyone can start right away.,"I‚Äôm a HUGE advocate for using DeFi on Ethereum as I think CeFi has completely opposite fundamentals from what crypto was initially created for, yet a lot of people still use it simply because it‚Äôs much easier.

A lot of people (especially newcomers to Ethereum) feel very intimidated by DeFi and the many things that one would need to learn about before starting that journey.

Impermanent loss, liquidity pools, flash loans, oracles, and everything in between. These are things that some people take weeks and even months to fully learn about and understand, so a lot of these people end up using centralized finance instead because it does the job for them.

That ease of use and user friendliness comes at a cost though and that is loss of custody and control over funds on the platform.

But none the less, this intimidation is definitely standing in the way of DeFi‚Äôs growth.

Another argument would be that CeFi fees are way lower but I think this argument grew irrelevant with time since more and more Ethereum based swaps and DEXs started building on L2s and commit chains.

 We‚Äôve all seen the boost in DeFi that some commit chains like Polygon ended up providing with the inclusion of swaps and DEXs including some like Quickswap, Uniswap, Meshswap, and 1inch.

These swaps and DEXs rival CEXs in terms of speed and affordability but we yet again go back to the problem of user friendliness. And while the ones I mentioned lean more toward the more user friendly experience, most DeFi platforms on the market aren‚Äôt.

You simply can use these platforms before you do a decent amount of research especially when there‚Äôs a lot of money involved.

If we don‚Äôt start seeing new development in the UI sector and user friendly experience from the entirety of the DeFi market, we might not be able to reach any form of mainstream adoption.",39.0,2022-10-01 03:39:16,0.75
Question About Apparent Censorship,"

"PoW vs PoS $225,907,500 Savings So Far","Hello Redditors,

I was reviewing the status of Ethereum today after the merge, it's been 14 days and wanted to see how we are doing.

I was using [https://ultrasound.money/](https://ultrasound.money/) to check on the supply of Ethereum and compare supply before and after merge.

If we were still on PoW we would have produced 180,329 Ethereum. Since we moved to PoS we have produced 8,554 Ethereum instead.

Doing some math using today's prices, say $1300 per Ethereum.

180,329 \* 1300 = $237,027,700 (PoW production of Ethereum)

8,554     \* 1300 = $11,120,200   (PoS   production of Ethereum)

11,120,200  - 237,027,700 = - $225,907,500.

What this tells me is that since the merge, Ethereum would have normally produced an additional $225,907,500 to it's market cap, which is usually collected by miners and maybe sold on exchanges. That's only in 14 days.

This is massive with the current state of things.

I believe the next bull run is going to be massive when the supply actually starts going negative combined with stackers trying to stake more to get higher rewards, just like what we saw with miners fighting over GPUs pushing the price of GPUs to the moon, stackers will be fighting over Ethereum coins.

What are your thoughts? Did I make any mistakes or overlook something?

Nothing posted here is financial advice. This is only for entertainment purposes.

Thoughts on Vitalik's L3 article,"As always, Vitalik's articles are super interesting and tightly-packed with good information:  
[https://vitalik.ca/general/2022/09/17/layer\_3.html](https://vitalik.ca/general/2022/09/17/layer_3.html)  


One of the uses he briefly describes, for L3,  is "" **L2 is for general-purpose scaling, L3 is for customized scaling**."". Though it might sound simple at first, I think this phrase hides deep and important implications  
C*ustomized scaling* is likely the most promising use of L3. One can enable exceedingly higher computational loads with application-specific rollup chains because of *local consensus*. Such application chains (in contrast to traditional sidechains) would use the general-purpose base layer (L2) for dispute resolution, thus deriving the security of the base layer, through a 1-of-N security model.

The shift from global to local (or application-specific) consensus affects how DApps relate to each other. This design *might* come at the cost of higher friction to composability, but that is a concern that is irrelevant for a broad class of applications. 

On the other hand, applications gain the ability to function without competing cannibalistically for the computer power of validators. It is possible to avoid network gentrification and ensure that things outside DeFi survive.  


In particular, applications that run on their own optimistic rollup chains with interactive fraud proofs (as compared to ZK rollups) can support computational loads comparable to mainstream (e.g.,  involving billions of instruction steps and large memory address spaces). It would enable a new class of decentralized applications that use alternative VM architectures running complex decentralized logic with mainstream software stacks. 

Being able to customize the app chain and choose the profile of validators is also a plus. Maybe everyone that cares about a cool decentralized MMORPG has a beefy computer that can process a bunch of stuff. You also get to customize the sequencer per application, maybe a DEX could forsake market maker fees for computation.   


Thoughts shared by [https://twitter.com/erickdemoura](https://twitter.com/erickdemoura) on twitter.   


What do you think? I totally agree that we're overusing global consensus and neglecting this idea of leveraging the 1-of-N security model to ""localize"" consensus and customize scaling.",22.0,2022-09-29 14:46:05,0.8

Hopefully, in 2 weeks we'll be collecting a community contribution from the mainstage audience at EFDevcon! üëÄ learn more: [github.com/ethereum/kzg-ceremony](https://github.com/ethereum/kzg-ceremony)

these Ceremonies have been called other names as well: Trusted Setup, Parameter Generation Event, Powers of Tau. Projects like aleoHQ, Zcash, Filecoin, CeloOrg, privacyscaling, tornadocash, 0xPolygonHermez, + others have all used these to add privacy or consensus improvements

Ethereum will be using it to enable scalability. In a ""rollup-centric"" world, getting cheap data (EIP-4844) to rollups is important! üöÄ Here's Vitalik's summary of what the ceremony generally involves (key: only 1 honest participant needed!) [https://vitalik.ca/general/2022/03/14/trustedsetup.html](https://vitalik.ca/general/2022/03/14/trustedsetup.html)

>That is to say, **hundreds of people participate in generating the data together, and only one of them needs to be honest and not publish their secret for the final output to be secure. Well-executed setups like this are often considered ""close enough to trustless"" in practice**.

Our ceremony will:

* be browser-based (accessible, no large files to download)
* only take \~2 min to complete
* aim to have the largest set ever (5k+ contribs)
* provide an easy to audit transcript (output summary of all contribs, which proves the ceremony is legit)

So far we've written the spec, main implementation, and gotten them both audited üôå Next, we will be finishing the sequencer + interface, testing that all the components work well & organizing addtl security reviews. ü§û If timing works out, we'll see you onstage at u/EFDevcon!

Post Devcon, there will be a public contribution period (\~2 months) where anyone can add their randomness to the ceremony üé≤ This is a great way for anyone to participate in building crucial Ethereum infra primitives üõ† all you'll need is a desktop browser and a few minutes!

## FATCA (Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act)

FATCA is the acronym for the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act, a law approved by the US Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and the US Treasury Department on 18 March 2010 to promote the tax transparency and encourage compliance by US persons with their tax obligations.

FATCA requires financial institutions around the world to identify those clients who are United State persons who have ‚Äì among others ‚Äì financial accounts in foreign countries that must be reported annually to the US tax authorities. To ensure compliance with FATCA, a 30% withholding will be applied to certain payments made to entities and people who do not comply with this regulation.

All Andorran banks are financial institutions and as such are obligated to comply with these regulations.

Due to the extraterritorial scope of this law, the United States has adopted an intergovernmental approach that consists of entering into bilateral agreements (Intergovernmental Agreement or IGA) with certain countries. Under these bilateral agreements, FATCA regulations are transposed into the internal laws of the signatory country in order to facilitate the practical enforcement of FATCA obligations.

There is currently no IGA between the United States and the Principality of Andorra. To this end, every Andorran bank must sign the FATCA agreement with the IRS and each one is subject to the fulfilment of the obligations arising therefrom.

In general, the obligations imposed by FATCA on Andorran banks are as follows:

1. Registration on the IRS website set up for this purpose.
2. Identification of any US Person who has an account with the bank and falls into any of the following categories:

* Citizens or legal residents of the United States. Not only US persons who reside in the US but also those who possess American citizenship, regardless of where they live, are bound by US tax laws.
* Companies incorporated in the United States or owned by one or more US Persons who exercise control of the company.

1. The following information on the financial accounts of clients identified as US Persons must be reported to the IRS annually:

* Personal information: name, address and US tax identification number (US TIN).
* Financial information such as the account number, the year-end balance, closed accounts, final balances and income earned on the account.

Financial accounts are understood as deposit, custody, and equity accounts and some insurance policies.

1. The withholding rules even apply to financial institutions that have not signed a FATCA agreement and clients with fiscal obligations in the United States who do not provide their information willingly or do not consent to report their information to the IRS (recalcitrant clients).

SEC claims the US govt has jurisdiction over all Ethereum network transactions now that ETH has transitioned to proof-of-stake & the majority of nodes being run are in the US. Do you think the SEC might eventually sue ETH like it did XRP for unlawfully issuing securities?,"Ethereum \[ETH\] has been one of the most-talked about cryptocurrencies over the past few weeks, with major updates like the Merge taking place. Apart from this, the network‚Äôs transition into proof-of-stake \[PoS\] has been fueling rumors about ETH being categorized as a security. Now, further strengthening this argument, the SEC in a lawsuit against crypto influencer Ian Balina claimed that ETH transactions automatically fall under the US government‚Äôs jurisdiction due to the majority of nodes being run in the country.

Balina was sued for allegedly offering unregistered tokens. He was caught in trouble after he failed to register his project as a security before rolling out an initial coin offering \[ICO\] in 2018. The crypto influencer outrightly denied these claims. However, the crypto community is currently speculating on SEC‚Äôs massive statement in the lawsuit. According to the 69th paragraph, the lawsuit stated that it had the right to sue Balina because the SEC had jurisdiction over the Ethereum network.

It was reported that a variety of U.S.-based investors participated in the Balina-curated investment pool. A network of Ethereum blockchain nodes further verified a number of ETH contributions. Due to this, the SEC stated,

‚ÄúETH contributors were validated by a network of nodes on the Ethereum blockchain, which are clustered more densely in the United States than in any other country. As a result, those transactions took place in the United States.‚Äù

Additionally, it should be noted that at present 42.56 percent or 3340 of the 7819 Ethereum nodes reside in the US.

**Will this statement take a toll on the Ethereum network?**

The Ethereum network has been dealing with immense backlash following the Merge. As mentioned earlier, some were suggesting that the network would fall under the SEC‚Äôs purview as it would now be considered a security. A few others on the other hand were taking digs at ETH‚Äôs level of decentralization.

Amidst all of this, the latest statement made by the SEC would be detrimental to the network. Even though several legal professionals noted that the complaint‚Äôs phrasing would have no legal significance, it would nevertheless be noticed.",108.0,2022-09-20 13:29:45,0.81
Is Ethereum a Security?,"Found this on the Web - [https://isethereumasecurity.com/](https://isethereumasecurity.com/)

# Is Ethereum a Security?

The question of if Ethereum is a security has been a topic of hot debate, especially as Ethereum transitioned to ‚ÄúProof-of-Stake‚Äù a model in which users stake their Ether on a validator and take part in rewards for validating the network.In order to answer if Ethereum is a security, at least in the eyes of US regulators, we must view it through the lens of a test known as the ‚Äú*Howey Test*‚Äù which is a **three-pronged**[1](https://isethereumasecurity.com/#fn:1) that determines if Ethereum is a security.It should be noted that *all* three prongs of the test must be met for something to be deemed a security.We can review the elements of the test individually:

## 1. An investment of money:

Prong #1 is simple and does not require debate. Ethereum **does** meet this criteria in a Proof-of-Stake model and requires a user buying or acquiring Ethereum to take part in staking.

The word ‚Äú*money*‚Äù does not negate or by-pass this prong.

The case ‚Äú*State V Gopher Tire and Rubber Co*‚Äù[2](https://isethereumasecurity.com/#fn:2) the court notes that ‚Äú*laying out of capital in a way intended to secure income or employement*‚Äù is sufficient to meet this prong.

It is also noted in ‚Äú*Uselton v. Commercial Lovelace Motor Freight*‚Äù[3](https://isethereumasecurity.com/#fn:3) the court expressly found that the ‚Äú*investment of money*‚Äù can take the forms of ‚Äú*goods or services*‚Äù or another ‚Äú*exchange of value*.‚Äù

Lastly, in ‚Äú*SEC v. Shavers*‚Äù[4](https://isethereumasecurity.com/#fn:4) the court expressly found that Bitcoin and other digital currencies could meet the standard of ‚Äúan investment of *money*.‚Äù

**Status:** Meets this Prong

## 2. In a common enteprise:

In order to review this prong one needs to understand:

* [Common Enterprise](https://isethereumasecurity.com/CommonEnterprise.html)
* [Ethereum Validation](https://isethereumasecurity.com/EthereumValidation.html)
* [Ethereum Rewards & Penalties](https://isethereumasecurity.com/EthereumRewardsAndPenalties.html)

The short summary of the Ethereum Validation system is:

* Your funds are not pooled with other stakers.
* If your validator is [*slashed*](https://isethereumasecurity.com/#) only you receive a penalty.
* Penalties take place if are offline too long (failed technical effort) or if you are malicious.
* You are only rewarded based on the role of your validator.
* Validators are rewarded for reporting slashable offenses, making them adversarial and not communal.
* Individual block proposers profit from extended effort such as MEV that is not shared by others.In line which each framing of common enterprise:

## Horizontal Commonality:

As outlined in ‚Äú*Revak v SEC Realty Corp*‚Äù[5](https://isethereumasecurity.com/#fn:5) the court looks for ‚Äú*the pro-rata distribution of profits*‚Äù and the ‚Äú*tying together of investors assets, via the pooling of funds*.‚Äù

In ‚Äú*Hart v. Pulte Homes of Michigan Corp*‚Äù[6](https://isethereumasecurity.com/#fn:6) and ‚Äú*Salcer v. Merrill Lync, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Inc*‚Äù[7](https://isethereumasecurity.com/#fn:7) the courts expressly suggest that the ‚Äú*investment* ***must*** *be part of a pooled group of funds*.‚Äù

And in ‚Äú*Milnarik v M-S Commodities*‚Äù[8](https://isethereumasecurity.com/#fn:8) it is noted that ‚Äú*the success or failure of other contracts must have a direct impact on the profitability of plantiffs contracts*.‚Äù

Since our Ethereum is not pooled and a validators profit or penalty is derived solely from their performance and does not impact other validators, we can conclude there is not ‚Äú*Horizontal Commonality*.‚Äù

## Vertical Commonality:

As outlined in ‚Äú*SEC v. Glenn W Turner Enters Inc*‚Äù[9](https://isethereumasecurity.com/#fn:9) vertical commonality requires the investors profits are ‚Äú*tied inextricably to the efficacy of the promoter*‚Äù

In ‚Äú*Villeneuve v. Advanced Bus Concepts Corp*‚Äù[10](https://isethereumasecurity.com/#fn:10) its noted that ‚Äú*the fortunes of investors need be linked only to the efforts of the promoter*‚Äù and in ‚Äú*Long v. Shultz Cattle Co*‚Äù[11](https://isethereumasecurity.com/#fn:11) expanded to note that it requires only that the ‚Äú*fortunes of invesntors be tied to the fortunes of the promoters*.‚Äù

First there is the challenge that it is not likely that there is grounds to find that there is an ‚ÄúEthereum Promoter‚Äù any more under the definition of this role. Yet, that is novel legal precedent that would need to be tested.

Instead, if we assume the Ethereum creators were found to be ‚Äú*Promoters*‚Äù for sake of the arguement, then the question is if their fortune is directly tied to the fortunes of the ‚Äúinvestors.‚Äù

By contributing to Ethereum, developers do not expressly own part of the network unless they themselves purchased Ether. As such, they cannot be deemed to be a promoter.

**Commonality**

The only commonality arguement that exists is that there is some sort of ‚Äúcommon enterprise‚Äù among validators running the network, and a cooperative mechanic between validators validating a transaction. However, as those are distinct and post facto to the development of the networks code, these validators cannot sufficiently be found to be ‚Äúpromoters‚Äù in any established sense of the term.

**Status:** Does not this Prong

## 3. An expectation of profit, derived from the efforts of others:

The final prong of the Howey Test is if the investor can have ‚Äú*an expectation of profit,* ***derived from*** *the efforts of others*.‚Äù

As outlined in ‚Äú[How Many Prongs Are In The Howey Test?](https://isethereumasecurity.com/ProngsOfHoweyTest.html)‚Äù it is important to note that this clause is a compound because:

* Users are allowed to expect profit, and,
* The common enterprise may have efforts of others.
* But, the **profit** must not be derived from the efforts of others.

In ‚Äú*United Housing Foundation v. Forman*‚Äù[12](https://isethereumasecurity.com/#fn:12) the courts expressly noted that the core of this is based ‚Äú*on a reasonable expectation of profits to be derived from the entrepreneurial or mangerial efforts of others*.‚Äù

This requires that we must not only expect profit, but the profit we expect must be from the efforts of others and not be from our own efforts or goods.

In ‚Äú*US v. Holtzclaw*‚Äù[13](https://isethereumasecurity.com/#fn:13) a church bought into a program to resell gold certificates from the ‚ÄúSell America‚Äù program, the courts found that a multi-level marketing program was not a security for the aggreved party, as they only earned from sales resulting from their own efforts.

While the ‚Äú*efforts of others*‚Äù were absolutely needed in order for their to be profit (Sell America had to acquire gold, issue certificates, create a system to sell and register those and redeem them) the profit expected did not stem from those efforts and **required** the efforts of the investor party to be selling.

As mentioned in the summary of [Ethereum Validation](https://isethereumasecurity.com/EthereumValidation.html) and [Ethereum Rewards & Penalties](https://isethereumasecurity.com/EthereumRewardsAndPenalties.html), we know that:

* Validators must use their own technical expertise to maintain adequate technology and uptime.
* Their validator is *only* rewarded when it takes part in validation.
* Their validator only earns a reward or penalty, for itself, based on its own actions.
* A validtor can increase their earnings, and only their earnings through implementing MEV strategies.
* Validators can increase their earnings by reporting bad validators in the set, making clear that the validator ‚Äúcommittee‚Äù is not a common enterprise with profits tied to each other, but instead an seperate and adverseral set of vendors.
* In theory a single validator could be rewarded if no other validator took part in the process, showing there is not a dependence on actions of others.

Ultimately this prong of the Howey Test posits the question ‚Äú*What are you being rewarded for?*.‚Äù

In the Ethereum network, you as a validator are not rewarded on the basis that the Ethereum developers continue to develop.

Validators are selling ‚Äú*reliable participation*‚Äù, they are rewarded for being available and accurate. We know this because a validator is [*slashed*](https://isethereumasecurity.com/#) when it has excessive downtime, or its trust becomes deficient and it is slashed on an individual level.

If we are rewarded for ‚Äú*reliable participation*‚Äù and slashed when and only when we have either downtime or lose trust, then this must be what is for sale.

The question then becomes is the effort of maintaining that ‚Äú*reliable participation*‚Äù by maintaining a validator sufficient that we are being clearly rewarded for our own individual actions rather than the efforts of others?

We believe the SEC has indirectly answered that for us already in ‚Äú*SEC v. Homero Joshua Garza*‚Äù[14](https://isethereumasecurity.com/#fn:14) in which Garza was charged with violating section 5a of the Securities Law Act of 1933.

In this case, the SEC viewed that owning and managing Bitcoin mining rigs/servers *was* a managerial effort, and that selling access to their future earnings was therefore a matter of expectation of profit at the efforts of others and thus a security.

Therefore we believe it is undeniable that the maintaining of an Ethereum validator which has the additional burden and complexity of uptime and accuracy requirements, should also be viewed as the key managerial effort, and therefore does not meet this prong.

**Status:** Does not this Prong

## Summary:

**Prong #2:**

* Hard to suggest there is an ‚Äú*issuer*‚Äù or ‚Äú*promoter*‚Äù at this point in Ethereum.
* Staking does not have horizontal commonality in relation to profits.
* Staking does have some horizontal commonality in relation to other validators, but they are not an issuer/promoter.
* Horziontal commonality in efforts is negated by the factor that the profits and loses are solely based on your own validators performance and actions.
* Your validator can be taken to another network is not locked in to any type of commonality.
* Staking does not have strong vertical commonality with the issuer.
* There is only broad vertical commonality, if you believe what is being sold is blockspace, and that the blockspace is owned by developers who publish code, but do not run the network.

**Prong #3:**

* There is an expectation of profits.
* Those profits are only derived from your own ability to maintain a reliable validator.
* The maintenance of a machine performing network validation has been shown to be a key managerial effort in the past.
* You are selling uptime and validation, and not blockspace, as your validator could connect to another PoS network, or fork, with other validators and do the same action.

This would mean finding Ethereum Proof-of-Stake to not be a security.

Any idea of how much ETH has not been made since merge?,Just wondering what is the daily difference in ETH made before merge as opposed to what's been made since merge.,62.0,2022-09-18 19:36:51,0.84
Expect at least a year before you start seeing lower gas. The merge won‚Äôt reduce gas fees but it‚Äôs the first step in doing so.,"A decent number of people were expecting gas fees to quickly and suddenly decrease right after the merge, but that is far from the truth.

Technically, moving to PoS does register a very tiny decrease in gas fees, but that change is basically negligible.  
The only thing that changes for now is energy consumption which will see a huge 99.9% decrease.

If you‚Äôre waiting for gas fees to become low, you‚Äôre going to have to wait at least a year from now until sharding gets implemented.

Even then, Ethereum itself won‚Äôt be cheap and never will if devs stick to the current roadmap.  
What Sharding will do is facilitate a groundwork for EVM compatible L2s to help scale Ethereum.  
And with enough time and upgrades down the line, L2s will basically become a part of Ethereum itself. They‚Äôll be indistinguishable.

Implementing scalability into the Ethereum chain itself would have taken a lot more time, energy, and resources.  
Meanwhile, L2s have been doing this for a while and they have the facilities, flexibility, and infrastructure to keep developing better ways to scale Ethereum.

Ethereum would need to a lot more time to test out scalability since a ton of private funds are on the line. Meanwhile, an L2 like Polygon for example has been doing this for years and they even have the groundwork for it. They have an entire data availability scaling solution which is the entire focus of sharding in the first place.

Sharding is officially slated for mid 2023 but considering that mishaps and extra testing might be happening especially after the delays that we experienced with the merge, I‚Äôm expecting sharding to get rolled out at least end of 2023

But that‚Äôs okay because current L2s are already doing a great job honestly but sharding will be the nail in the coffin for any criticism regarding Ethereum and I‚Äôm here to see all of that unroll.",54.0,2022-09-18 15:13:56,0.72

It seems like just another tactic from the SEC to delay crypto adoption,"It is known for years that ETH will switch to PoS.

Which airdrops are you looking forward to right now?,"Hey y‚Äôall,  


At the onset of these bear conditions, the majority of dapps I've used have become CeFis, while others fell apart before they could form a token. I feel like I‚Äôm doing something wrong considering the number of years I have used Ethereum and have only received two airdrops. 

Currently, I am looking at L2‚Äôs like [Zksync](https://zksync.io/). I can‚Äôt recall Arbitrum having a token. I have just recently heard about [Flare](https://flare.xyz/) releasing their FLR token this month and I‚Äôm eager to try my luck.

How Realistic is the Centralisation Risk of PoS?,"A popular criticism following the Merge is that 4 entities own 64% of validator nodes. 3 of these are exchanges (Coinbase, Kraken and Binance) which are centralised and they'll have to adhere to wallet blacklists sent by the government.

SCAM alert! Beware of the new ETHW and ETHPoW coins created on the main Ethereum POS chain.,"TLD: Pairs containing ETHW or ETHPoW at DEXs like Uniswap are likely to be scams.

The core devs of Ethereum are moving away from the POW chain to the POS chain, but that doesn't mean that the POW chain has to die. With this in mind the new POW chain will have the token renamed to ETHW or ETHPoW. The POS chain will keep the ETH name for its token.

BUT, I'm seeing tons of ETHW and ETHPoW created on the POS chain, meaning that these are likely to be scams. These are already trading in Uniswap and other Dex and I'm 99% sure they are scams.

For these not to be scams will have to be backed from some sort of bridge between the two chains which is unlikely to exist today considering that the fork has happened just now and the old POW chain is under reorganisation (or not).

**Frequently Asked Questions**

**Where's the best place to buy ETH?**

There are many centralized exchanges that support Ethereum. If you live in the US, the most popular exchanges are Coinbase, Gemeni and Kraken. Coinbase users can use Coinbase Pro for lower fees.

**When is Eth2 launching?**

Eth2 is a marketing term used to represent a number of updates to Ethereum. The Eth2 proof-of-stake chain first launched in December 2020. ""The Merge"", which is the event that will fully switch Ethereum's consensus to proof-of-stake, is estimated to be ready in early 2022, although there is no exact timeline. Other updates, such as data shards, will follow that update.

Visit [ethmerge.com](https://ethmerge.com/) to learn more about ""The Merge"".

**Do I need to do anything to update to Eth2? Will Eth2 create a new token?**

No, ETH holders *never* need to take any action to keep holding ETH. Ethereum users will be unaffected by the Eth2 upgrade. And the Eth2 updates will not create any new tokens.

**How can I stake my ETH?**

The best way to stake your ETH: by running your own validator.

* Running your own validator requires a modern computer and 32 ETH. Visit /r/ethstaker for more details

**Why are Ethereum transaction fees so high?**

Like most blockchains, Ethereum fees are determined by supply-and-demand. The large demand to use Ethereum has pushed transaction fees quite high (however, fees were just a few cents only 2 years ago). Fees are especially high during market volatility, and during NFT drops.

**What is being done to lower Ethereum transaction fees?**

Ethereum fees are reduced by using layer-2 rollups. Rollups are scaling solutions that allow for significantly cheaper transactions, while still maintaining Ethereum's security.

Additionally, Eth2's data shards will make rollups even cheaper.

While rollups are cutting-edge technology being actively developed, a number are already live on Ethereum mainnet. Visit [l2beat.com](https://l2beat.com/) to learn more about rollups.

**What's the best wallet for Ethereum?**

The most popular tool for using decentralized applications is Metamask. However, for security reasons, we recommend using a hardware wallet such as a Trezor or Ledger.

Ethereum APY reaches 6.15%+ on AAVE - a massive milestone in Crypto that can open the floodgate for institutional money in ETH and its ecosystem. Bullish flag for overall crypto! PERSPECTIVE,"ETH APY typically ranged from <1% (most of the time) to 1-2% often on AAVE but reaching 6.14% as of the time of writing this post is a pretty massive milestone!

That type of yield on the relatively most secured blockchain on a permission-less DeFi protocol (AAVE) can attract massive influx of institutional money. This was a big a reason for Solana's rise last year as institutions loved 6%+ yield on a well funded/ well backed project with stable and strong team. Now think about where Ethereum stands compared to Solana and what can a 6.15% APY unlock for it and its ecosystem. Merge itself is a big milestone for ETH but it is amazing to see that yield!

More power to ETH and its ecosystem. More power to entire Crypto universe!

Our heavy reliance on centralized exchanges will give governments much more leverage over us just like what happened with Tornado Cash,"Most of these centralized exchanges are US regulatory compliant, meaning they were forced to flag and seize accounts that were related in any sort to Tornado Cash.

Now this wouldn‚Äôt be a problem is we all used DEXs but the vast majority of the crypto community owns a lot of money on the CEXs. This is exactly why it became a such a huge deal.

The US government would have close to no leverage if we all used DEXs. What can they do?

Ethereum developers, major crypto influencers and the entire community would simply not care and carry on with their lives.

This is exactly why I think DeFi and DAOs are the only way to go if we ever want to achieve complete self governance and financial freedom.

Why do people even use these CEXs? They have KYC plus DeFi and DAO have way better features to offer, self governance being the most important.

The only drawback is higher gas fees but that‚Äôs being solved by man L2s

Some like Zksync are even developing DAO specific scaling solutions like the one funded by Bitdao (ZkDAO) which will help reduce gas fees by a wide margin.  
I still don‚Äôt understand why we‚Äôre so heavily reliant on CEXs.

I know that TVL on DEXs is higher but that still doesn‚Äôt change the fact that TVL on CEXs is dangerously high to the point where governments can use it as leverage to enforce their rules on us and regulate the way they want.

Investing in a centralized exchange goes against everything that crypto stands for. The main reason crypto was created in the first place was for us to manage finances without have the government‚Äôs nose up out butt, yet somehow they now have our facial IDs and passports through KYC.

What is ‚Äúdata availability‚Äù and why is it the top priority for Ethereum‚Äôs development team right now? Let‚Äôs talk about it:,"# EDIT: I've previously posted about both the merge and Sharding. All of these subjects are related and intertwined so I would really suggest you give them a quick read

Objectively speaking, Ethereum by far has the top-tier ecosystem on the market with some of our favorite projects and dApps built on it.

However, Ethereum is also infamous for its high gas fees, slow transactions, and overall lack of scalability and efficiency.

One of the major reasons behind this problem is ‚Äúdata availability‚Äù or more precisely the lack of it.

In order to explain what ‚Äúdata availability‚Äù is, we first need to talk about Ethereum nodes and how and where they store data. We also need to discuss L2s a little bit so I‚Äôll try to make this as easy as possible for the average Joe to understand.

# - What are Ethereum nodes?

Ethereum nodes are essentially a group of computers that keep a full and comprehensive record of every single activity that happens on the entire Ethereum blockchain.

This obviously takes up a HUGE amount of precious and expensive space and processing power which renders Ethereum quite inefficient.

The main issue here is that a lot of this stored data is not being used and will most likely never be used. But its still there non the less and will always be there even after merging and sharding are implemented.

# - What is data availability?

Data availability as a concept and practice is not something new. It has been around for a while. But things get complicated when blockchains are involved and thus this concept on Ethereum is still new and not fully implemented.

Data availability is the practice of storing data off of the operating system or network (in this case, the Ethereum blockchain) and only presenting the needed data at the needed time.

**Here‚Äôs a nice analogy:**

**Let‚Äôs say you work on a computer but that computer has so much data stored that it‚Äôs making it very slow and clunky in performance. You also realize that you don‚Äôt need ALL of the data at once yet you still want to keep that data just in case you ever needed it someday.**

**What you do is you end up storing said data on a designated computer or hard drive and only extract the information you need at the current moment thus relieving much of the strain on the computer you work on.**

Now, this process is a bit more complicated when blockchains and the billions of dollars of transactions and assets on them are involved because there should always be irrefutable evidence that the stored data is indeed there and isn‚Äôt being tampered with.

This is where L2s get involved.

# - How can L2s help with data availability?

After the merge is fully implemented and Sharding is introduced, L2s will gain a lot of extra throughput to process information and gain faster prover times.

As mentioned before, the Ethereum beacon chain itself won‚Äôt be scalable. This responsibility will fully lie on L2s some of which are already working on scaling solutions focused on data availability.

This is why I was focused on mentioning Polygon in all of my previous posts regarding the merge and sharding because they‚Äôre developing a data availability scaling solution (Polygon Avail) and they actually just released the testnet yesterday (it was part of the reason that made me compelled to write this post and explain the importance of data availability for the future of Ethereum

Scaling solutions like the one being developed by Polygon store all the massive counts of data off of the Ethereum chain and provide only the needed information at a given moment while still giving irrefutable proof that the entire compilation of the Ethereum database is indeed intact and untampered with.

# - Conclusion?

When we talk about dank sharding, we‚Äôre actually talking about multiple upgrades but the most important of them all is indeed data availability.

If Ethereum wants to stay secure and decentralized but also fix the scalability problem, then data availability should be the main focus (and it is).

I hope I was able to explain the importance of data availability in a way that the average Ethereum user can understand without getting into so much technical detail.

Why do you need blockchain for smart contracts?,"Sorry for this crazy basic question, but it's one that is bugging me.

The case for smart contracts has been around for decades. Nick Szabo's essay is well-known. He did not think about blockchain, only that one day interconnectedness will enable effective smart contracting with real-world applications.

I understand the difference between a blockchain and a centralised server.

I, for one, do not believe that the ""idealistic"" side of blockchain is enough to ensure its adoption. That idealistic side can usually be summed up as ""decentralised is better"" and I think it's, at the very least, debatable. But I am also not sure real businesses really care.

I understand the use case of smart contracts, smart contracting and machine contracting. I do believe there are fantastic applications for those.

But please can anyone give me a compelling argument for why you need the blockchain for this and not a very reliable centralised cloud provider?",26.0,2022-09-01 06:23:39,0.69
"To quote the Ethereum Foundation: ‚ÄúThe Ethereum ecosystem is firmly aligned that Layer 2 scaling is the only way to solve the scalability trilemma while remaining decentralized and secure.""","I‚Äôve been seeing a lot of people especially on subs like r/cc claim that ‚Äúthe merge will make L2s irrelevant‚Äù but this is simply NOT TRUE. In fact, the complete opposite is true and I think it‚Äôs a little ignorant not to learn about this and subsequently spread misinformation in the crypto space.

On the contrary to what these people believe, L2s will be the main focus for the Ethereum development team in the upcoming years as the merge happens and then dank sharding starts getting developed.

L2s won‚Äôt only be helping Ethereum scale its new beacon chain, they will literally become part of that chain down the line.

A lot of people are confusing merging with sharding and these two are not the same.The merge will not make gas on Ethereum cheaper, in fact, nothing will.

What the merge will do is significantly reduce power consumption (more than 99%) and pave the way for sharding which will in turn give a major boost of L2s and their throughput.Ethereum‚Äôs beacon chain will always be expensive to operate and will instead rely on L2s to handle the data.

In fact there are already scaling solutions being developed solely for that purpose most notable of which is Polygon Avail which will store data off chain and present only the data needed at the moment. This kind of scaling solution will drastically help with traffic and gas fees and will transform Ethereum into a much more efficient kind of blockchain.

So don‚Äôt go out thinking L2s will get phased out. Ethereum will rely on them heavily in the upcoming years.In fact Ethereum already relies a lot on L2s as I imagine the vast majority of us use them every single day.",431.0,2022-08-31 07:35:59,0.95
Wrote a tool to generate historical PNL of any wallet on Ethereum,"I've been trading crypto long before Uniswap was a thing. But during all those years, nobody to this day created a simple script to generate a ROI/PNL report for your DeFi trades. Tired of waiting, I decided to build it myself.

"What happened with Ava Labs is a clear indication that any crypto with a company behind it, is not really crypto. It‚Äôs just a tool to help fund and further the main company‚Äôs agenda.","So apparently this is still ‚Äúalleged‚Äù information and the Avax team has denied the claims (although they still haven‚Äôt published any explanation up until now)

But we‚Äôve seen enough videos, recording and claims to sure that there is at least something very unethical practice happening with Ava Labs and Avalanche.

**TLDR;**

**Ava Labs (the company behind Avalanche) hires a legal team which then intentionally sues multiple big name networks in the market like Solana and Binance‚Äôs BSC chain in order get rid of competitors and get access to said competitors‚Äô insider information through dirty legal tactics.**

Even some of the biggest and most respected names in the space like Foobar and Gainzy have already denounced Avalanche and their alleged practices.

I‚Äôm not here to antagonize any AVAX holders, on the contrary, I‚Äôm here to give my opinion/advice regarding these centralized companies and projects invading the crypto space.

Its very ironic of Avalanche to claim that they‚Äôre ‚Äúcompletely decentralized‚Äù when everything happening behind the scenes (regardless of what happened yesterday) is fully controlled by a 100% centralized company with their own stocks, agendas, and profiteers.

Don‚Äôt get me wrong, we obviously need major companies to participate and get integrated into the crypto space if we ever dream of going mainstream.

I‚Äôve always been vocal about this. I‚Äôll use Polygon as an example here because they‚Äôre Avalanche‚Äôs main competitor and have always been attacked by Emin on Twitter (along with the many other projects he ironically slanders there as well)

Polygon has already helped introduce many companies into the crypto/Web3 space including social media conglomerates like Facebook and Disney, online payment giants like Stripe, and some of the most recognizable brands in the world like Coca Cola.

However, the main difference is that these companies have no control, influence, or any kind of say about what Polygon can or can‚Äôt do.

They don‚Äôt use Polygon as a way to manipulate the market to their own personal advantage.

Its so funny how Emin describes Avalanche as ‚Äúdecentralized‚Äù and accused not just Polygon but MANY other networks of being centralized and to some extent even evil, when the reality is that he was always doing the exact opposite of what he preached himself.

I won‚Äôt get into technical bullsh#t and all the ‚Äúsell now‚Äù or ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs going to see the same fait of LUNA‚Äù cringe you see everywhere.

I will however say advise anyone reading this to NOT invest any money into a coin that is backed by a company.

This literally goes against everything that crypto stands for in the first place.

I really hope this end well for Avalanche, its holders and its builders because non of them were involved in the dirty tricks that the higher ups were involved with.

I do hope however that these higher ups do receive the consequences they deserve.",319.0,2022-08-30 05:14:15,0.84

Mark Cuban counts himself among supporters of the upcoming Ethereum merge,"Billionaire Mark Cuban counts himself among supporters of the upcoming Ethereum ‚Äúmerge,‚Äù a highly anticipated upgrade for the blockchain that will dramatically reduce its ecological footprint.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm a fan of the merge,‚Äù Cuban, a Shark Tank investor and owner of the Dallas Mavericks, tells Fortune. ‚ÄúI think the energy usage issue is important.‚Äù

Indeed, the merge‚Äîestimated to happen Sept. 15‚Äîwill shift Ethereum from a proof-of-work consensus mechanism to proof of stake. Proof of work is an energy-intensive process that relies on miners to add new blocks and verify transactions, whereas proof of stake instead relies on a network of validators. In turn, once the merge happens, mining on Ethereum will be effectively eliminated, and its overall energy consumption is expected to decline by 99.9%.

That‚Äôs why Cuban said he sees the move to proof of stake as a positive.

‚ÄúBut it‚Äôs long term. I don‚Äôt \[know\] if and when it goes up,‚Äù he added.

Even still, ‚ÄúI think the applications to drive usage will be there,‚Äù Cuban said, adding that he remains super bullish on Ethereum.

When previously discussing his affinity for Ethereum, Cuban has repeatedly mentioned the network‚Äôs applications and use cases being a driver behind his support. Mainly, he‚Äôs talked about his interest in smart contracts‚Äîcollections of code that execute a set of instructions on a blockchain. 

‚ÄúWhat really changed everything was smart contracts,‚Äù he said in March 2021. ‚ÄúSmart contracts came along, and that created DeFi \[decentralized finance\] and NFTs \[or non-fungible tokens\]. That‚Äôs what changed the game. That‚Äôs what got me excited. That‚Äôs why it‚Äôs a lot like the internet.‚Äù

Cuban owns Ether, along with other cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and the meme-inspired Dogecoin. His portfolio also consists of a few NFTs and investments in blockchain companies, many related to bettering Ethereum.

Torando Cash‚Äôs ban wouldn‚Äôt have been as bad if we weren‚Äôt so dependent on centralized platforms. Here's what I mean,"A lot of people have become skeptical saying ‚Äúif crypto was supposed to fight tyranny and centralized authority, then how did the US government cause such a ripple in the space?‚Äù

The main reason this happened is because of us, not crypto itself. We let centralized exchanges take over the entire crypto space. What do you expect to happen when an American centralized exchange like Coinbase or Binance US have everyone‚Äôs private information and facial ID?

What do you expect to happen when we rely on Tether or Circle for our stablecoins instead of something like MakerDAO‚Äôs DAI?

We are all a part of the problem. What we are in right now isn‚Äôt a crypto market because it‚Äôs centralized asf.

What we‚Äôre doing goes against everything that crypto stands for in the first place.

What happened to the days where DeFi was king?

Don‚Äôt get me wrong, DeFi TVL is still higher than that on CEX and we‚Äôre still seeing a lot of development in the DeFi world

AAVE will soon drop their own algo stablecoin similar to that of DAI.  
Bitdao already has $1.5 billion worth of assets in its treasury treasury and will soon launch its own L1  
Curve voted on adding even more liquidity to their pools (which is great because that would boost algo stablecoins even more).

But all of that alone still doesn‚Äôt matter when the other half of crypto is still run by centralized exchanges.   
Yes, DeFi TVL is higher but you can‚Äôt ignore how huge CeFi TVL is as well. People aren‚Äôt willing to lose this much money.

If we‚Äôd all use DEXs, DAOs and other DeFi tools, we wouldn‚Äôt care less about what the US government says because they can‚Äôt reach us. But when USDC, USDT, Coinbase, Binance US and many more crypto companies are US law abiding companies then it‚Äôs a big deal.

So bottom line, stop blaming crypto and DeFi. The fundamentals are still there. Start blaming the people that made the crypto space regulatory compliant. This is the reason why the US has such a huge effect on the crypto market that was supposed to be decentralized and only answers to the community in the first place.",128.0,2022-08-24 05:01:05,0.87

The Ethereum Merge and everything after," 

 *The Ethereum Merge is by no means the final stage of Ethereum's journey. It's a crucial step but still won't help Ethereum scale right away. In a recent talk, founder Vitalik Buterin sketched the milestones and end goal. In short: 100 thousand transactions per second, without sacrificing decentralization.*

Buterin unfolded the Ethereum roadmap at a conference in Paris in July 2022. He claims the long-anticipated Merge will make Ethereum about 55% finished after the Merge is complete. So then what's left to do? The end goal is to dramatically increase capacity without ultimately turning Ethereum into a massive centralized database. This requires all sorts of crafty ways to compress data and outsource data storage away from the Beacon chain.

The Ethereum Merge is arguably the major milestone as it replaces Ethereum's 'engine': its consensus mechanism. On the surface, users will not spot the differences between before and after. We can think of the Merge as keeping the exterior of a car intact while replacing the combustion engine with an electric engine. No small feat!

All the steps that come after the Merge are less fundamental but no less important: they have to do with scalability. They ensure that Ethereum can process orders of magnitude more transactions. Those improvements have to do with revving up the engine.

## Phase 1: The Merge¬†

The Ethereum Merge has been in the works for about seven years. The upgrade is all about the switch from proof-of-work to proof-of-stake. The Beacon chain, which has been tested for almost two years, will be merged with the old Ethereum blockchain. Mining will no longer be a business model in the Ethereum ecosystem and so Ethereum post-Merge will consume 99%+ less energy than before.

Also, from an investor‚Äôs perspective, Ethereum will change. Instead of miners securing the network, it will rely on ETH owners locking up some of their ETH as collateral to earn staking yields. Staking Ether becomes like an ""internet bond"" with the lowest risk of all Layer 1s. We‚Äôre dealing with a fundamentally different ‚Äòeconomy‚Äô here. After the Merge, Ethereum will no longer be a ‚Äòmine-and-dump economy‚Äô but a ‚Äòstake-and-hold economy‚Äô. Whereas miners have to sell sooner or later to pay their bills, stakers benefit from staking as many ETH as possible: after all, compounded interest makes one wealthy.

The reason that Ethereum proponents are calling Ether ""ultra-sound money"" is that Ether will probably become deflationary after the Merge. Until the Merge, the block reward for miners is about 13,000 Ether per day. After the Merge, the new amount of ETH drops to just 1,500 per day. This 90% reduction corresponds to roughly three Bitcoin halvings. Hence, this deflationary move is also called the triple halving. Subtract from that the roughly 8,000 ETH burned per day, and your back-of-the-napkin calculus will tell you that the amount of existing ETH will decrease by roughly 1-2% per year.¬†

## Phase 2: The Surge

No, the Surge is not about the expected rise in the price of Ethereum... It‚Äôs all about scaling. As Vitalik Buterin said in a July 2022 interview:

*""You can lose a billion dollars from a hack but you can also lose a billion from everybody needing to pay way higher fees than they have to.""*

Scaling of many orders of magnitude is essential if Ethereum wants to support a decentralized ‚Äòworld computer‚Äô that supports thousands of apps *and* that is affordable to use.

When Surge? After a hopefully successful Merge, work on the Surge will begin. Completion of the Surge is expected in 2023 but of course, there are no guarantees.¬†

The letter S in the wordplay on Merge refers to Sharding: the parallel existence of 64 blockchains or shards. This divides the huge data load that Ethereum will face (and already faces). All this data can of course not be crammed onto a single blockchain, because no one would be able to run an Ethereum node anymore. So to avoid throwing decentralization out of the window, Ethereum has to divide and conquer.

Of all 64 shards, the Beacon Chain - as the name suggests - will be the one that other shards rely on. The Beacon chain is often compared to the highway and the other shards to side roads. That‚Äôs one way to visualize it, as it conveys the image of spreading the traffic load. But this comparison misses the point that the shards will most likely not process transactions. Instead, they are used to store transaction data. So a more apt comparison would be that of the Beacon chain as the production line of the factory and the shards as data warehouses (even though it‚Äôs still a possibility that some shards will get execution rights).

Despite being (mostly) ‚Äòjust‚Äô data warehouses, the shard chains will offer big improvements to transactions per second when combined with rollups. This is where so-called Danksharding comes in.

**Danksharding**

A few technical approaches have been suggested to take data load away from the Beacon chain. The details still have to be fleshed out. Danksharding is now the most likely candidate: it‚Äôs named after the developer who proposed it (Dankrad).

Danksharding works with ""data availability sampling,"" a technique that allows nodes on Ethereum to verify large amounts of data by sampling only a few pieces. It‚Äôs an efficiency measure and it is well-suited for the rollup era. Rollups, like sidechains, take the pressure off Ethereum by performing transactions on a separate, layer 2 chain.

## Phase 3: The Verge¬†

The Verge will introduce Verkle trees, yet another means to scale with greater efficiency. In Buterin's view, the Verge is ""great for decentralization.""

Verkle trees are of course a pun on Merkle trees, which are already used in Bitcoin and Ethereum. Merkle trees are a tool for ensuring reliable encryption by turning blocks of information into long strings of code. By adding all transactions in a block and creating a fingerprint of the entire set, it allows you to verify whether a transaction is included in the block. Verkle trees, in other words, make it possible to store a large amount of data by showing a short proof of any piece of that data. So they make the process of proof efficient. In this way, Verkle trees are a powerful upgrade to Merkle proofs. They will allow users to be network validators without having to store large amounts of data on their hard drives. Keep it decentralized!

## Phase 4: The Purge

The Purge is about removing (""purging"") old data from the Ethereum blockchain. Again, this will alleviate the data storage requirements for users who want to be validators but who do not have hundreds of Terabytes available.

After the Purge, Ethereum clients will discard data older than a year. This should minimize chain clogging and allow many more transactions to be processed. Buterin expects Ethereum to process 100,000 transactions per second after the implementation of The Purge.

Ethereum devs will still have to figure out where all those old blockchain data will go. Even though they are ‚Äòold‚Äô, they are still vital to all kinds of applications. Where do all those hundreds of terabytes of essential transaction data go? One option is Arweave, the protocol created with the explicit goal of making centuries-long data storage possible. Arweave already stores the entire blockchains of Solana and Avalanche.

## Phase 5: The Splurge

According to Vitalik, the Splurge is all about the ""fun stuff"". Let‚Äôs see what techniques the dev team will come up with to further scale and speed up the Ethereum ecosystem, without sacrificing decentralization.¬†",43.0,2022-08-23 08:48:59,0.9

**INTRO**

**Transferring tokens between distributed ledgers**

>Tokens cannot simply be transferred from the distributed ledger for one cryptoasset to the distributed ledger for a different cryptoasset. For example, a bitcoin cannot exist on the Ethereum blockchain. An effect comparable to a ‚Äòswap‚Äô can be achieved using a smart contract and secure public address. The holder of the tokens uses a smart contract to transfer tokens to a public address that they don‚Äôt control. An equivalent amount of tokens of the second cryptoasset are transferred from a secure public address to a public address controlled by the person.

>The question that arises is whether this type of transactions results in a disposal for CGT purposes (for guidance on the general interpretation of disposal see CRYPTO22100. HMRC‚Äôs view is that the answer will depend on the facts.

**‚ÄòOne-way‚Äô transfers**

>Some transfers can only go in one direction, meaning that once the transfer has been made it cannot be undone or transferred back at a future date. **An example of this can be seen with the Ethereum blockchain. Currently ether are on the Ethereum ‚Äòmainnet‚Äô (short for main network, the main public Ethereum blockchain). Holders of ether can choose to transfer their tokens from the mainnet to a different blockchain called the ‚ÄòBeacon Chain‚Äô. The Beacon Chain blockchain is where Ethereum‚Äôs ‚ÄòProof of Stake‚Äô will be implemented (for more information on Proof of Stake see CRYPTO10300. It will be impossible to transfer ether from the Beacon Chain to the mainnet, making transfers a one-way process only.**

>HMRC‚Äôs view is that **TCGA92/S43** applies to this type of transaction. The allowable costs in respect of the first cryptoasset are attributed in full to the second cryptoasset. A gain or loss will accrue as normal on a subsequent disposal of the second cryptoasset.



**TCGA92/S43**

[https://www.gov.uk/hmrc-internal-manuals/capital-gains-manual/cg17370](https://www.gov.uk/hmrc-internal-manuals/capital-gains-manual/cg17370)

>Where assets have been merged or divided or have changed their nature or
rights or interest over assets have been created or extinguished and therefore
the value of an asset [A]
is in any way derived from another asset [B]
which the taxpayer owns or has owned,
TCGA92/S43, see CG15200, provides that an appropriate proportion of the sums allowable on the disposal of asset B under TCGA92/S38 (1)(a) and (b) shall be attributed to asset A.

>If expenditure incurred on asset B, but attributed to asset A, falls within TCGA92/S38(1)(a), for indexation purposes it is treated as incurred when asset A was acquired. See example in CG17484.

Best way to stake 32 eth?,I‚Äôm feeling bullish and want to spend my money inherited on eth. If I bought 32 eth would it be easy to stake or complicated?,56.0,2022-08-22 00:08:44,0.73
Censorship and a potential fork (not powchain) after the Merge that may have serious consequences - summary,"There's a lot of confusion on this subject so I thought this would be worth posting.

After the merge, US based validators (PoS stakers) may be prevented from validating OFAC sanctioned transactions (e.g. tornadocash) if the US government decides so. Currently it is unclear whether this is the case. Anyone exposed to these sanctions will err on the side of caution to avoid jail time. Example - ethermine have been censoring TC sanctioned transactions for a week already (Bitfly who own ethermine will also be operating validators after the merge).

There is a very large portion of stake that would be exposed to these sanctions including some very large centralised actors such as Lido, Coinbase and Kraken. These 3 alone hold roughly 45% of all staked eth. There is not enough time for all of their stakes to exit the network due to the exit queue mechanism. If lido and coinbase both try to exit it would take about 2 months for all the validators to be removed from the list of validators. Until you're removed from the list you are expected to validate and are subject to penalties if you don't.

These validators will be forced to either 1. violate OFAC sanctions, 2. censor the transactions, or 3. abstain on blocks with sanctioned transactions. The board of Lido, Coinbase etc. are not going to prison for the good of Ethereum so we can safely rule out option 1 - despite what they may say on twitter.
If they take option 2 and censor, their stakes will get slashed (they lose 50% of their customer's funds) and their validators get kicked off the network.
If they take option 3 abstaining, they will also bleed out due to a penalty called inactivity leak, losing 50% of customer funds, and get kicked off. Inactivity leak is normally a very minor penalty, however if more than 33% of validators are inactive it gets much more severe (because this prevents block finality) and after 21 days, 50% of funds are lost and you are kicked off. Because so many validators will be exposed to the sanctions it is highly likely the severe leak penalty will be applied.

The 4th option is to fork into a censored ethereum chain. It is very likely that their customers will start screaming for this when they see their eth stakes melting due to penalties (slashing/leaking). Ok, so what you might ask, if they want to run off let them.

The problem is the stablecoins. If US validators fork off into censored-eth, the supply of USDC/USDT will have doubled, but Circle and Tether collateral has not. The stablecoin operators will have to choose a chain to support with their collateral. Unfortunately, it is again very likely that Circle, and probably Tether also, will opt to support the censored chain - this is because, as we all know, a lot of the money in the market comes from the USA. Stablecoin operators are already in the spotlight and they would likely see even more intense scrutiny if they were to instead support the uncensored chain. Both Circle and Tether are exposed to US law.

On whichever chain the stablecoin operators abandon, the entire defi system will immediately implode. Stables are used for collateral almost everywhere you look. They will become worthless on the chain they abandon.

Unfortunately the OFAC sanctions have come at the perfect time for this to be a problem It is too late to prevent this because of the exit queue system in place for validators, and the merge only being a month away. The only way to 100% guarantee this scenario does not play out is for the merge to be delayed again AND for Lido, coinbase and Kraken to voluntarily exit their stakes.
An issue with this is that their boards are legally obligated to act in the vests interests of their companies (and not their customers, or ethereum). Lido essentially shutting their business down flies directly in the face of this fiduciary obligation. It's hard to say how that will play out.

So we may be left with an uncensored eth that is in tatters because the stablecoins have abandoned that chain, and a censored chain that is essentially subject to the will of the US government - something Ethereum was specifically meant to avoid.

Right now the best thing we can do is look for ways to prevent this. I would start by campaigning for Lido etc to exit their stakes ASAP to prevent this situation. And unfortunately would ask the eth devs to push the merge back one last time for the greater good.",54.0,2022-08-21 02:39:39,0.74

Tax implications of any possible Ethereum fork.,"Hi, I have some Ethereum on a hardware wallet that was UNFORTUNATELY purchased on Coinbase with its KYC. The IRS already has ruled that forks and airdrops are classified as income meaning I would be charged tax for the value of the fork on the day I received it. This is a confusing cluster for me. I haven't been through this before. I might have to sell the fork on the first day just to be rid of it and put aside a portion for taxes but I don't even know if coinbase would let me send ETH back to them to somehow sell the fork which they probably won't support. Any good advice is appreciated. Thank you.",27.0,2022-08-20 18:17:51,0.78

The IRS is going to have a field day if ETHPoW becomes a thing post Merge,"According to [current IRS guidance](https://www.irs.gov/individuals/international-taxpayers/frequently-asked-questions-on-virtual-currency-transactions), individuals that receive tokens post hard fork must count them as ordinary income equivalent to their ‚Äúfair market value‚Äù upon receipt. This would be the moment a hard fork occurs for private wallet holders or when your CEX registers them in your account for those with funds in exchange.

Given the value might be fairly high initially (some might even argue it should have the equivalent value to ETH at the time of the split) then probably crater soon after, it would seem this represents a fairly large tax liability for current ETH holders.

What will be the next hyped market?," Over the years, we have seen various trends in fashion, food, and other areas, but Cryptocurrency has its own set of directions/hype. As Cryptocurrency is slowly being mass adopted, new markets emerge within the crypto industry. When this became a thing, it gained popularity in the mainstream media thanks to the bull market. If we had the current market back then, I doubt they would be known or will garner a massive amount of users. [Axie](https://axieinfinity.com/), [Pegaxy](https://pegaxy.io/), and [God's Unchained](https://godsunchained.com/) were some of the most popular games. Some people from third-world countries even used Axie as their sole source of income, leaving them in debt. 

Because they can be used in some P2E games, NFTs rode along with the P2E hype. Here are what are commonly referred to as ""jpegs."" They claimed that no two NFTs are alike, but many derivatives exist. There were even lawsuits/almost lawsuits, similar to [what happened with Bored Ape](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/vkoeli/yuga_labs_files_lawsuit_claiming_bored_ape_yacht/). To be honest, I was not a fan of NFT arts. But of course, NFTs are not just limited by jpegs and should not be only associated with it. NFTs can be lots of things like Music, Tickets, and In-game skins. Honestly, it can be anything. It just needs a little more time to be more polished.   


People have brought new markets such as virtual lands and more to the limelight. Some of them include Kirin's learn-to-earn project, in which you can answer quizzes and tests to earn crypto assets, [Aavegotchi](https://www.aavegotchi.com/) and [YOLOrekt's](https://www.yolorekt.finance/) bid to earn. They are distinct, but they both perform the same B2E function. In Aavegotchi, the Aavegotchi B2E auction modifies at least one of the four personality traits of an Aavegotchi: Energy, Aggression, Spookiness, and Brain Size, whereas YOLOrekt's B2E allows you to predict the price of the LP and bid on it. They are Dapps that you can use to make money quickly. I've tried them all, and based on my experience, so far, YOLOrekt's b2e is a much faster and more efficient way to earn, but of course, it's riskier and also, SocialFi is a key part of their concept. [Augur](https://augur.net/) is another example of a B2E, I heard it is much more difficult to use, but it has a much wider range of bets, which is fantastic. I would love to use it, but sadly, it's not available in my area. In comparison to other markets, Bid to Earn and Learn to Earn is still in their early stages.  
Also, stablecoins have grown in popularity as a means of securely storing value. For years, many individual traders have used [stablecoins](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/r04oye/i_think_im_missing_something_with_staking/) to ""park"" the value of their cryptocurrencies during non-trading hours and to transfer crypto between trading accounts. Stablecoins, on the other hand, gained popularity as a means of exchange for institutions for the first time in 2021, similar to other trends that existed for years but only recently gained popularity.

Crypto trends/hype can come in different forms. Anything is possible since we already had a Shitcoin era where there was a time when we had a constant flow of new useless coins called butt coin, porn coin, and a lot more. It's just a matter of time to know whether such projects will continue to be great or survive after the hype has gone down.",221.0,2022-08-17 05:55:51,0.91

I said it once and I‚Äôll say it again. Gas fees on Ethereum will NEVER be cheap. Rollups are the ones that will have incredibly low gas fees. Let me explain:,"# EDIT: would love to answer any questions regarding sharding in the comments. I actually made a post 2 days ago that is entirely dedicated to sharding with a lot of details that can help.

&#x200B;

Sharding (which will eventually be introduced by mid-2023) will not change throughput for Layer 1. It will however dramatically pump throughput for Layer 2 and beyond. This throughput will increase anywhere from 10k to 100k depending on the type of Layer 2 and the technological advancement of said Layer 2.

Initially, Vitalik and the rest of Ethereum‚Äôs development team did indeed plan on lowering gas fees on the Ethereum blockchain itself. They planned on implementing sharding all over the blockchain including EVM, data, smart contracts, accounts, and everything else on the chain.

However, it dawned upon them later on that it would be much easier and less complicated to implement sharding just for data, and thus the responsibility of scalability suddenly didn‚Äôt lie on the Ethereum blockchain but on rollups.

You could argue against it but I personally think it was a good idea. L2s have one job and that is to scale Ethereum. So they already have the tech development ready to be implemented and upgraded as opposed to Ethereum developing their own built-in scalability which might take years.

Then there‚Äôs the fact that these L2 have already been tried and tested multiple times. They know exactly what could go wrong and how to avoid it.

Ethereum on the other hand never had a built-in scalability system and thus if anything goes wrong it would be a nightmare.

L2s are incredibly safe because they derive their safety from Ethereum itself so you‚Äôre basically using Ethereum but in a much more efficient manner.

This is only gonna get better and better as new zkEVM tech starts rolling out.

Right now there are only a couple proper zkEVMs that are in development most prominent of which are Polygon‚Äôs Hermez and Zksync‚Äôs zkEVM

The main difference between these two is that currently Zksync‚Äôs is still closed source which I personally think makes it much harder for developers to use and to some extent defeats the purpose of a zkEVM

Hemrez on the other hand will be fully open source and accessible for any developer to build dApps with which is great news for the Ethereum ecosystem overall

But other than that, I have no criticism. I think what scaling solutions are doing right now is already amazing. Coupled with sharding later on in 2023 (hopefully lol) and they will make Ethereum unstoppable.

Any criticism about Ethereum being inefficient will be put down instantly.

To some extent, scaling solutions won‚Äôt be thought of as a separate part of Ethereum that helps it scale. They will literally become an inseparable part of Ethereum itself and will become taken for granted even as part of the Ethereum experience.",406.0,2022-08-16 04:13:14,0.85

What would happen if the US Treasury puts the USDC/WETH and/or USDT/WETH LP CA's of Uniswap/Sushiswap and the other dexes on the blacklist?,"Would Circle and iFinex/Tether blindly update their contracts within 24 hours? I mean, it basically means the state demands them to burn some IOU's that can then not be exchanged for backing meaning these companies now get to keep that backing.

Can you still open up your LP tokens to get ETH back if there is an error on the USDC?

To those who are asking why the US Treasury would put these CA""s on their blacklist .... what if a politician with enough power to put pressure on the US Treasury decide to put these on there with the intent to crash the price of Ethereum because he shorted it first.

Some other unknowns.

all the USDC inside USDC/WETH is suddenly frozen on the top 10 dexes, what happens to oracles like chainlink what price for USDC/ETH do they report if something like this would happen?

Standardizing trustless DApp frontends,"This is something I've been mulling over a long time and it seems timely to have a discussion about it. 

**Why are smart contract frontends still websites? Why haven't we moved past this?**

There are multiple pressing reasons for moving towards trustless frontends:

 * Developers may be compelled to limit access to their own DApps, pushing users to questionably safe alternative frontend implementations. We see this now in the scramble to comply with sanctions.

 * Hackers or malicious devs change the website code to steal funds. Recently seen in the DNS attack on Curve, this has happened often since the beginning, keeps happening, and will continue to happen as long as smart contracts are being accessed through websites. It is inherently insecure.

 * Web code is nigh-unauditable. Even if it wasn't subject to arbitrary updates at any moment (such as hosted on IPFS), it's still very difficult to determine the code does nothing malicious, because a modern website is a bloated mass of compiled javascript.

What would an alternative look like?

I envisage a client application that takes a smart contract address and a maximally barebones UI specification (more of a config file than a website), and renders a working interface for the user. These specifications would be simple for someone familiar with the intended use of the functions in the target smart contract to tell from a brief reading whether they are malicious. There could be some mechanisms for confirming legitimacy for regular users, like the UI specs being included as annotations in the comments of the smart contract, or message signing from the official devs or trusted figures attesting they've looked it over and it seems fine.

Any thoughts or ideas? Are there other considerations such a standard would need to address? Have things like this already been attempted? Are there reasons it hasn't or wouldn't work or be adopted?",23.0,2022-08-13 20:23:23,0.97

If you participated - thank you for doing so. I think you will be glad that you did not just sit back and observe.



**Update 2**

It seems [someone](https://twitter.com/jeetsidhu_/status/1558416493494386688) is making a bunch of withdrawals from TC and is sending it to prominent folks using the ENS registry. I know this is probably controversial, but I think it's good. This affects everyone of us and no one - particularly people that made a shit ton of money off of Ethereum should be allowed to feel like it does not concern them.


**********************************************************************************

If you are still wondering if this is important or not - let me add a few additional thoughts:


The only thing that is pretty decentralized in Ethereum right now are the nodes (the miners). Come THE MERGE this will no longer be the case - Lido will be an enormous centralizing influence and it will be the point of gov't attacks and pressure to drop certain transactions. 

This is not a question of ""IF"" but of ""WHEN"". This needs to be planned for ahead of time. I hope everyone understands that if validation can be captured it's game over for Eth.

What will we do when the gov't knocks on Lido's door and tells them to drop certain transactions from black-listed dApps? In many ways what is (or is not) happening now is a rehearsal for what will happen then.

"A follow-up to my ‚Äúwhat is the merge‚Äù post. This time let‚Äôs discuss the next upgrade after merging, ‚ÄúThe Surge‚Äù.","As with the merge, the surge has more than one step to it but we‚Äôre only really interested in one important thing which is Sharding

Now before we understand what Sharding is we have to understand why Ethereum is so expensive and slow to use in the first place.

I expect that a lot of users here already know how the Ethereum bidding system works so you can skip this one right away if you want to

&#x200B;

# - Why is Ethereum so inefficient?

Ethereum currently runs on PoW (proof of work) meaning that all transactions are proven to be real by miners that solve very complicated computational problems for a small fee of course.

You as a user would obviously want your transaction to go through fast but Ethereum is a very popular chain and there are a lot of people ahead of you. For you to try and ‚Äúskip ahead‚Äù of them, you‚Äôll basically ‚Äútip‚Äù the validators a little bit more than others, and boom! You become their priority. So basically its a bidding game. Whoever is willing to ‚Äútip‚Äù more gets their transaction validated faster.

&#x200B;

# - Why does the merge come before the surge?

Think of Ethereum as a long stretch of road that has one single lane. It works well sometimes but when it gets congested, IT GETS CONGESTED‚Ä¶

This is exactly why the merge comes before all other upgrades.

Developers realized that Ethereum has great demand and the ‚Äúroad‚Äù  they created(which represents the blockchain)  needs a ton of new fixes. But fixing this ‚Äúroad‚Äù means that traffic will come to a complete halt and so will hundreds of billions of dollars in assets.

Therefore they created a completely different ‚Äúroad‚Äù which is the beacon chain and that chain has the capacity to undergo upgrades and development without having to stop traffic.

&#x200B;

# - What is Sharding and how does it work?

What Sharding will do is the equivalent of creating many more lanes (64 to be exact) on a brand new created road (the Beacon chain).

Ethereum can only process around 15 transactions per second and has maxed out once at only around 16 TPS. So it‚Äôs safe to say that Ethereum isn‚Äôt the fastest of blockchains. So developers came up with Sharding as a solution.

Sharding is an algorithmic process of splitting a blockchain up into many smaller pieces and, well, shards with many of these pieces overlapping and working in parallel. It is executed in a way that will allow anyone to verify their shard and still 100% trust the rest of the blockchain.

&#x200B;

# - Initial plans for Sharding and how they changed

The plan initially was the implement Sharding on the entire Ethereum blockchain (this includes the EVM, data, smart contracts, account, and everything else on the chain). However, Vitalik and the rest of the developers decided that it would be a better idea to implement Sharding on the data alone. This is why ***rollups will take over scaling and not the blockchain itself***

&#x200B;

# - The importance of L2s for the future of Ethereum

As I mentioned in the previous section, plans for Sharding changed and the responsibilities of scalability now fall on L2s (rollups basically).

Scaling solutions like Optimism, Immutable X, Arbitrum, Loopring and many more do all of their computations and storage offchain and end up posting data back to Ethereum

Without getting into a lot of technical details, Sharding will basically put these scaling solutions on Steriods

I mentioned in my previous post that I am in fact biased towards Polygon and some people in the comments genuinely asked as to why. Here is exactly why I‚Äôm biased towards them (by the way this does not mean that I think other scaling solutions are bad. I‚Äôm fond of many other scaling solutions and I always invite competition)

The most important feature of Sharding is data availability.

Right now there are Ethereum nodes. They‚Äôre essentially a bunch of computers that keep a fully comprehensive record of the entire blockchain. As you can imagine, this takes up A TON of precious and expensive space for data.

Well, it just so happens that Polygon already has a solution for that in the form of Polygon Avail. No other scaling solution has their current technology in that sector.

What Polygon Avail essentially does is solve the problem of data availability by storing data offchain and presenting only the needed data when actually needed

It basically shows Ethereum proof that ‚Äúyes, the entire data is safe and sound. Here is the small amount of data you need right now‚Äù without having to burden Ethereum with the massive amounts of data that most of it won‚Äôt be used and will slow down the Ethereum network.

Again, I think competition is an amazing thing to have especially in a tech market like this one so I support all scaling solutions but as I said, I personally think Polygon has an edge over others.

&#x200B;

# - Some cool features that come with Sharding

This post is starting to get long so I‚Äôll talk about one feature actually that I think is very cool but is also extremely important

Sharding will actually change the way that nodes are selected to validate each shard

I‚Äôll throw in an example given by Vitalik.

Imagine there are 6,400 nodes and 64 Shards (the standard). Every time that a shard and a block need verification, the Beacon chain (new PoS chain) will select at random 100 nodes to validate a block and the same will happen for the next block and the one after that, and so on (all at random).

The cool and important thing about this all lies in security. An attacker will now find it much harder to attack the network because he will require a large portion of the network to do so and would need that for a much longer time now.

I hope this post was helpful and I‚Äôd love to answer any questions in the comments!

I enjoyed answering questions in the previous post and would love to make another post about the upgrade after the surge (the verge, or Merkle trees update) if it wins popular demand!",102.0,2022-08-12 16:18:43,0.9
"This is Going to Be Unpopular, but Ethereans Need to Hear It","I deeply disagree with the actions taken by OFAC. Nonetheless, I want to understand why the govt attacked Tornado *specifically*, while leaving other privacy protocols untouched. The statements and actions by the US govt actually make it quite clear why these Eth addresses were sanctioned and placed on the OFAC list ...

Tornado Cash is an Eth address where people input personal funds to a shared common pool. Ultimately, they will end up in possession of units of Eth which came from other people. This is a cooperative process. A large amount of funds from hacks/crimes are transparently being sent to that common mixing pool.

***From the govts perspective*** (not my own), this is no different than swapping marked $100 bills with gangsters. Users are choosing to swap their units of Eth, with Eth that came from criminals. ***This*** is the primary/critical reasoning by which OFAC sanctioned those Eth addresses.

Critically, this is not a broad generic attack against privacy and anonymity. For example, the govt left Monero untouched, despite the fact that it's larger, offers better privacy/anonymity, and has existed for longer.

Because ***from the govts perspective***, there is a big difference, since Monero is an encryption protocol where your funds are *NEVER* sent to a common pool, and you can prove that you *NEVER* end up with anyone else's units of XMR. Monero is functionally very different than a mixer.

For bureaucrats and lawyers, that is a huge distinction. If you think about it ... encryption is still legal. VPNs, Tor, and Monero are still legal. The ***only*** thing that OFAC sanctioned, were the addresses being used to ***mix*** funds together.

I understand why the ETH bros want to portray this as a broad attack against all privacy protocols. But that simply isn't the case. It's ***only*** an attack against protocols which require the active mixing of your funds together to a common pool.

I still believe that this is bad for the ecosystem, and Orwellian AF. But I also want to understand the proper context of the govt's attack vector. As Sun Tsu said: ""Know your enemy.""",70.0,2022-08-11 18:18:13,0.73
"What is the Ethereum merge, what are its economic implications and what are its main risks and misconceptions?","Before we understand what the merge really is we first have to understand the difference between PoW and PoS and how Ethereum will transfer from the former to the latter.  
I‚Äôm assuming that the vast majority of users here understand this so you can skip this part if you want.

# - PoW and PoS

As of the writing of this post, Ethereum currently runs on PoW (proof of work). The main goal of the merge is for Ethereum to move over to PoS (proof of stake).

The main difference between these two is that with PoW the network is secured by miners that have to purchase and run Ethereum mining hardware. This model has proven to be extremely inefficient since miners have to consume electricity in order to issue new blocks. This is exactly why Ethereum is notorious for being slow and expensive.

With the PoS model, on the other hand, the network is secured by validators who instead stake ETH in order to validate network activity. With this model, power consumption decreases dramatically.

With PoS, the network becomes more efficient, more secure, and can start benefiting from further upgrades most prominent of which is Sharding (which will be mentioned later on)  


# - What is the ‚Äúmerge‚Äù?

When people talk about ‚Äúthe merge‚Äù they‚Äôre actually talking about two-step of which the actual merge is one of them.

The first step is launching the Beacon Chain which was already done successfully in December of 2020.

The main goal behind this was to be able to test a chain running in parallel with the already existing PoW network without causing any disruption.

Another reason for this was to give time for stakers to stake enough ETH to secure the new network when implementing the actual merge

The second step is what we call the marge and it's what everyone is talking about right now.

The merge is simply the act of merging the consensus layer of the Beacon chain with the EVM state of the Ethereum PoW chain.  


# - What happens when the merge is fully implemented?

For starters, the power consumption needed to execute transactions and everything else on Ethereum dramatically decreases from what it was with PoW.  
In fact, it will decrease by almost 99.95%.

This is great for multiple reasons:

Firstly this makes Ethereum ESG compliant which is great for institutions overall especially ones that are regulatory driven. This will most definitely help boost mainstream adoption since many more global institutions will start exploring the Web3 space.

Second of all, a lot of the environmentally driven critics will finally shut down their arguments about NFTs, DeFi, and all Ethereum activity overall ruining the planet.

Third and finally, the merge will open up the groundwork for new updates included in the Ethereum roadmap that all of which combined will improve Ethereum overall, most important of which is Sharding.  


# - Misconceptions about the merge and how Sharding is related to that

The merge on its own will not make Ethereum gas fees lower. In fact, NOTHING will make gas on the Ethereum chain itself lower.

The Ethereum roadmap is not working on lowering gas fees on the chain, but instead is working on improving and integrating rollups and L2s in order for THEM to help with gas fees and traffic overall.

The L2 wars are more competitive than ever before but I think this is good news for Ethereum overall because it rewards innovation and new tech. But I‚Äôm personally biased towards Polygon as of now.

Speaking of which, I still have no idea how people still fall for this misconception that L2s and scaling solutions will be irrelevant with ‚ÄúETH 2.0‚Äù (which isn‚Äôt even a thing anymore) even though Vitalik himself talked about it at the Polygon ZK summit back in 2021 where he discussed the importance of rollups on Ethereum

Ever since then, we‚Äôve seen a flurry of development in the rollup scene and most notably the ZK-rollup with the recently mentioned Polygon leading the way with their open source zkEVM.

They already have 8 multipurpose Ethereum scaling solutions all of which will become even more efficient with Sharding introduced.  


# - What is the main risk behind the merge?

Any upgrade to any new technology comes with risks. This isn‚Äôt ‚ÄúFUD‚Äù. These are simply very improbable yet still realistic scenarios that may compromise the security of the PoS network.

Right now the biggest concern is a DOS scenario.

Since validators are the ones that are securing the chain, the network can technically be in danger of something called Network In Denial of Service (DOS) where if the attacker can know exactly which proposer is next in line they can try to DOS said proposer and strip them of their slot. The transactions that come with this slot can now be picked up by the attacker.

This is a very improbable scenario and already has solutions most popular of which is SSLE. Its basically complicated cryptography that prevents the attacker from knowing which proposer is next in line

The Ofac has decided to sanction code and speech and knows it will take years to play out in court. Now every dev team in the world has to live in fear if it does not institute on chain full KYC aml for all defi protocols.

I tried to tell people for the last two years that the end game of the government was to force narcware at the software level, I begged people on reddit to take the Fatf revision drafts in 2019 and 2020 serious, that the drafts were openly stating that they want narcware on wallets and they want all wallets fully doxxed and declared, they want an gap in chain history to be criminal. 

I am not paranoid. I understand the law. The lawyers to Ledger and Trezor understand the law. Coincenter understands the law. **Reddit does not understand the law.**

The point of shutting down Bitmex to US customers was to create precedent for the Banking secrecy act applied to US citizens involved in crypto and precedent for extraditing foreigner non US citizens. This shows deliberate premeditation by the Department of Justice, State Department, and Treasury to force US aml/kyc laws and SEC/CFTC licensing regimes through violence against non US citizens. Their long goal was to violently intimidate other countries into complying with our laws. 

We are already looking at every american being a felon because 6050i revision was passed in September 2021 and will come to term in January 2024, where it will go into effect as enforceable. The government is openly long conning us to enforce global KYC on Defi, and software wallets, and eventually hardware wallets. They know they're violating the 4th and 1st amendment and they intend to get away with it through terrorism using Ofac.

They have long had a desire to destroy end to end encryption, this is an open plan Bill Barr had, they want golden keys to all encryption, they do not want permissionless systems to exist, and yes they can sanction the repository of monero code, and begin enforcing these strict liability 30 year prison sentences onto anyone who uses monero and gets caught. 

You people are not using your brains. The only way to convince Federal prosecutors that a protocol can comply with US sanction and aml laws is to enforce KYC and licensing systems, this is crony gangster capitalism to benefit Terrence Duffy, SBF, and the Chicago Mercantile Exchange and american Web 2 Tech companies, and US private equity by using \*Terrorism\* to put their permissionless competitors out of business, and enforcing the KYC necessary to enforce the licensing system! and they're taking your privacy!

The tornado cash opportunity. How we can learn from this attack to prevent it from happening again,"The recent sanctions of the US government marks a **new chapter** in the history of Ethereum. It‚Äôs the first time that the US directly attacks a smart contract.

With their actions they have demonstrated that they know better our vulnerabilities than what we thought. But this demonstration of power can teach us how they are going to proceed in future attacks, which for sure are going to come as the Ethereum network starts taking away a big share of the financial system.

From the experience of this attack we can see that the principal point of failure in the current system is all of the non-decentralized platforms and protocols that are not required but essential to make the network work. I‚Äôm going to enumerate them and some possible solutions to the problems:

* **RPC‚Äôs**: it doesn‚Äôt make sense to have a 100% decentralized system if the channel that you use to connect to it is 100% centralized. We need to start using by default in our wallets decentralized RPC‚Äôs. Unfortunately this is not easy, as running a full node requires a lot of hardware requirements. Fortunately we‚Äôll soon have light clients which will enable us to query and validate the network with little resources.
* **DNS**: dapp‚Äôs must have a frontend deployed on IPFS (with a decentralized pinning service like Filecoin) accessible with a .eth domain. But this is not enough! as currently the DNS translation is done using centralized RPC‚Äôs. When light clients are available, browsers will need to use them as the default DNS resolver.
* **GitHub:** I wouldn‚Äôt have ever imagined that this could pose a threat to Ethereum security but as we saw it‚Äôs a significant point of failure. **All the DAPP‚Äôs code must be always accessible** in a decentralized, global, searchable place, with a nice UI to interact with it. Currently there are two projects aiming at solving this problem: [radicle](https://radicle.xyz/) and gitopia.
* **USDC/TETHER:** we already knew this but it is good to remember the risk that this kind of stablecoins generate. Fully decentralized stablecoins don‚Äôt exist, but DAI and FRAX are a significantly better option as not 100% of its collateral comes from assets outside of the chain.
* **Metamask:** there has not been any problem with it, but as a closed source software and critical part of most of the Ethereum transaction we should take it into consideration. A project aiming to solve this problem is [tally](https://tally.cash/), they are fully open source and they have a DAO, although their product doesn‚Äôt have as many features as Metamask yet.
* [**localcryptos**](https://localcryptos.com/) **> Coinbase:** last but not least. Even if all the previous measures are implemented correctly it is going to be of no use if the government prohibits citizens from using a dapp. Wallets should be anonymous from the first time that users get into crypto so the government can‚Äôt impose their regulations on the users, so stay anonymous and evade KYC.

And that‚Äôs all, hopefully with measures like this and more that will come we‚Äôll be able to build a better future.

A developer.

**Frequently Asked Questions**

**Where's the best place to buy ETH?**

There are many centralized exchanges that support Ethereum. If you live in the US, the most popular exchanges are Coinbase, Gemeni and Kraken. Coinbase users can use Coinbase Pro for lower fees.

**When is Eth2 launching?**

Eth2 is a marketing term used to represent a number of updates to Ethereum. The Eth2 proof-of-stake chain first launched in December 2020. ""The Merge"", which is the event that will fully switch Ethereum's consensus to proof-of-stake, is estimated to be ready in early 2022, although there is no exact timeline. Other updates, such as data shards, will follow that update.

Visit [ethmerge.com](https://ethmerge.com/) to learn more about ""The Merge"".

**Do I need to do anything to update to Eth2? Will Eth2 create a new token?**

No, ETH holders *never* need to take any action to keep holding ETH. Ethereum users will be unaffected by the Eth2 upgrade. And the Eth2 updates will not create any new tokens.

**How can I stake my ETH?**

The best way to stake your ETH: by running your own validator.

* Running your own validator requires a modern computer and 32 ETH. Visit /r/ethstaker for more details

**Why are Ethereum transaction fees so high?**

Like most blockchains, Ethereum fees are determined by supply-and-demand. The large demand to use Ethereum has pushed transaction fees quite high (however, fees were just a few cents only 2 years ago). Fees are especially high during market volatility, and during NFT drops.

**What is being done to lower Ethereum transaction fees?**

Ethereum fees are reduced by using layer-2 rollups. Rollups are scaling solutions that allow for significantly cheaper transactions, while still maintaining Ethereum's security.

Additionally, Eth2's data shards will make rollups even cheaper.

While rollups are cutting-edge technology being actively developed, a number are already live on Ethereum mainnet. Visit [l2beat.com](https://l2beat.com/) to learn more about rollups.

**What's the best wallet for Ethereum?**

The most popular tool for using decentralized applications is Metamask. However, for security reasons, we recommend using a hardware wallet such as a Trezor or Ledger.

"Merging and Sharding won‚Äôt make scaling solutions obsolete. On the contrary, they‚Äôll give scaling solutions more value.","This is a very common misconception in the Ethereum space and it‚Äôs actually been addressed on multiple occasions for a while not. Yet, the nearer the merge will be happening the more I‚Äôm starting to see people comment about ‚Äúscaling solutions being obsolete when ETH2.0 rolls out‚Äù.

First of all, ETH2.0 is not a thing anymore. Ethereum on its own will not scale. ETH gas fees will always be high and we should swallow that pill already.

Ethereum is following a rollup-centric roadmap that will give more advantages and leverage to L2s and NOT the Ethereum blockchain itself.

This is exactly why we‚Äôve been seeing so much development recently in the L2 space especially with zero-knowledge.

ZkSync has had their zkEVM testnet out for months now. Although I think its very frustrating that its closed source. It literally defeats the whole purpose of a zkEVM.

Polygon has their zkEVM in development still right now but its the only open source zkEVM that I know of so far.

And we‚Äôre only getting started. The growth in the L2 and scalability game is growing exponentially each passing day.

If we keep up this pace, Ethereum will become unrecognizable. The gas fee issues will become entirely irrelevant and Ethereum critics will shut up.

This will all happen thanks to scaling solutions, not Ethereum itself.

Vitalik himself even expressed his support for L2s and said something along the lines of that Ethereum‚Äôs future relies entirely on scaling solutions and more specifically rollups.",64.0,2022-08-06 21:33:42,0.85

Don't use Arbitrum network with Binance, who knows what else they implemented incorrectly.

\*\* Update \*\*

Someone suggested me to send a small amount to trigger their deposit script. It worked in the worst way possible.

ETH were transferred into Binance Hot Wallet, but not add to my account. My account only increased by 0.00000002 ETH which was the amount I deposit to trigger the script.

I was on a discussion with Binance to ask them send the ETH out to my own wallet, so it won't mess up their database. Now this solution is no longer possible.

\*\* Update\*\*

Binance finally add the ETH to my account, despite they said multiple times it is impossible in the support chat.

I think the key is that small amount triggered the script and pull all ETH into Binance Hot Wallet, so they no longer have the reason to not giving me the funds. Bravo to u/frank__costello for the brilliant idea.",52.0,2022-08-05 07:39:22,0.87
Technical questions around how validation will work under Danksharding," Hi all,  


I have some technical questions about danksharding and validation committees.

From this post on two-slot proposer-builder separation: [https://ethresear.ch/t/two-slot-proposer-builder-separation/10980](https://ethresear.ch/t/two-slot-proposer-builder-separation/10980), danksharding is meant to be a two-slot process, meaning (if I've understood it correctly) it will take two 8-second slots for the whole build-propose-verify-append process to be completed.

https://preview.redd.it/ilra7u7ajpf91.png?width=1162&format=png&auto=webp&s=58908e091f7da720e50bea2363c220e50feac1a4

With PBS, after the intermediate block deadline, we see the remaining 'N-1 committees' attest to the block body. My first questions:  
1. Is the committee size here still the same as that intended immediately post-Merge, i.e. 128 validators, or something else?  
2. What is N here? The whole validator set available divided by 128?  
3. These N-1 committees attest to the block body tying up to the block header. But do they also verify for data availability and transaction validity (i.e. check for validity proofs in the case of ZKRs, or raise fraud proofs in the case of ORs)?  


My next questions relate to this report: [https://members.delphidigital.io/reports/the-hitchhikers-guide-to-ethereum](https://members.delphidigital.io/reports/the-hitchhikers-guide-to-ethereum), and specifically, this image from it:  


https://preview.redd.it/jf4k0qucjpf91.png?width=3600&format=png&auto=webp&s=aa1842526b6b9dd1369c895b8a7ff623325028c9

(Image taken from section titled 'Danksharding ‚Äì Honest Majority Validation'.)

My additional questions from the image:  
4. 1/32 of the whole validator set is assigned to attest to the data availability of the block in each slot, as there are 32 slots in an epoch. But with PBS, the block cycle now should take two slots! So is this incorrect? Or should it be something like 1/16 attesting every two slots?  
5. Is '1/32 of the validator set' meant to be the same as the 'N-1 committees', and these data availability checks happens at the same time as that process? Or is this data availability verification a separate process with different groups of validators that happens after the 'N-1 committee' attestation?  
6. Does the '1/32 of the validator set' also attest to the transaction validity of each block?   
7. Later in the same report it's stated that it's intended for the other full nodes (i.e. those not in the validation set) to do their own private data availability sampling. If so, will they \*\*also\*\* be doing their own transaction validity verifications? This may be trivial for validity proofs, but I expect it may be quite onerous for fraud proofs. How would this work in practice?",23.0,2022-08-04 14:34:18,0.93
Will generating ZK proof on L2 be decentralised? Which hardware will be used?,"I‚Äôm not sure if this should be submitted here or on r/Ethermining. But the main thing is ZKP so this should be here? Anyway,

I have some gpu cards which I‚Äôve been using for mining eth and bitcoin in the last 2 years. Since Ethereum is transitioning from PoW to PoS while Bitcoin mining with GPU isn‚Äôt that profitable, I‚Äôve been considering to sell those cards

However, yesterday I found this [article from Scroll](https://scroll.mirror.xyz/nDAbJbSIJdQIWqp9kn8J0MVS4s6pYBwHmK7keidQs-k) where it says they will generate ZKP in parallel. I guess it means ZK proofing will be the next (somekind of) mining

Then I found this [post from Paradigm](https://www.paradigm.xyz/2022/04/zk-hardware), according to the article, FPGAs will be used due to its flexibility, ASICs maybe used if a ZKR dominating the L2, while GPUs are the most less likely to be used for generating ZKP

I was disappointed for a min, yet I found this [article from Polygon](https://blog.polygon.technology/introducing-plonky2/). They invent Plonky2 where it can generates ZKP using M1 Pro GPU on a Macbook in less than a sec

So, should I swap my GPU for ETH LSDs or should I wait for parallel ZK proofing as a substitute for mining?

Did you know that NFT tickets are planned for the 2023 Rugby World Cup and the Olympics and Paralympics 2024?,"I've always been a supporter of blockchain tickets since it's been shown that they eliminate all scams, frauds, and black marketing. They are the safest option for purchasers and quite valuable for event organizers, also, buyers may gain much from these NFT tickets.   
 

As a result, I was both astonished and delighted to learn that the 2024 Olympics in France will sell this sort of ticket. As I read, they said that these tickets will provide spectators with increased protection.   
 

Think about the recent ticketing scandal in France during the Champions League final. Following this shambles, I wouldn't be surprised if UEFA starts selling NFT tickets as well.   
 

I believe it is prudent to keep a look out for NFT ticketing systems in general, since more and more events will begin to offer these tickets. Whether it's NFT TiX or another platform, these platforms are unquestionably the future of the ticketing system.   
 

Researchers even describe how all of this will operate during the Olympics, stating that fans would be able to access them by scanning a QR code produced using blockchain technology. Everyone will check in, and once inside the arena, their tickets will be deactivated.

"Vitalik once said ‚ÄúI don't hate apes, I just want them to fund public goods!‚Äù. Just cause we CAN build anything on Ethereum doesn‚Äôt mean we SHOULD","Yes, Vitalik created Ethereum for people to build anything on it. Ethereum is completely decentralized so no one can tell you what to build, what to invest in and what to support over all. Decentralization means you can literally do anything you want as long as it‚Äôs within the blockchain‚Äôs reach.

But that doesn‚Äôt automatically mean that we should be dumping billions of dollars combined into projects that have no real utility or purpose to the community.

The entire reason Ethereum (and decentralization) was created was to give power to the populous.

Its a still very early conversation, but if DeFi and DAOs go mainstream we become a self governing society. This is what the vision of Vitalik was when he created Ethereum.

Again, you could technically use Ethereum solely for creating dog coins and no one can stop you. But why do that? It has no real utility of value.

DeFi and DAOs on the other hand provide value and services for the populous.

You can use something like AAVE to take out a loan any time of the year regardless of you background. This was what real value is. You can use something like Bitdao to govern the ecosystem by your own. They‚Äôre literally going to be governing a new L1 on their own. This is what real decentralization is all about. Not dog coins and monkey pictures.

Dr. Ian Malcolm once said, ‚Äúyour scientists were so preoccupied with whether or not they could, they didn't stop to think if they should.‚Äù This also applies to Ethereum. A lot of people look at decentralization as ‚Äúi can do whatever i want‚Äù which is technically true.

NFT tickets significantly increase the client's trust,"I believe it will undoubtedly improve market circumstances, therefore increasing sales. The following are some of the key benefits of employing NFT in the ticketing sector.  


There are several significant advantages, including:  


\- Elimination of fraud/fake tickets,  
\- Programmable NFT tickets - In practice, event organizers may earn while selling NFT tickets on the secondary market by writing the profit allocation criteria for future resales into them (or their smart connections).  
\- NFTs can convert the tickets into a payment mechanism, creating a massive possibility for income (for example, NFT tickets can be used as collecting goods or as bonuses to entice people to purchase a particular number of tickets to events).  


In reality, you can figure it all out a lot more easily, I've learned so much about NFT TiX and its perks.  


Of course, there are some additional advantages, such as the possibility to reduce ticket costs and the speed with which NFT tickets may be generated.

"Happy Birthday, Ethereum!","Today the second biggest cryptocurrency - Ethereum - celebrates its 7th birthday. What did those years look like?

Price-wise, Ethereum grew A LOT. From its all-time-low in 2015 of $0.432979 to its all-time-high of $4878 in 2021.

Technology-wise, Ethereum has pioneered the concept of a blockchain smart contract platform and built a strong foundation for many new projects.

Ethereum‚Äôs DeFi scene is the biggest one out there, with successful DApps bringing more awareness to the platform over the years. And let‚Äôs not forget artists that make millions of dollars by bringing their work to the blockchain via NFTs.

Fun fact, the co-founder of Ethereum, Vitalik Buterin, says that the project is now only 40% complete.

At the Ethereum Community Conference in Paris, he compared the network to its longtime rival, stating that ‚Äúthe difference between Bitcoin and Ethereum is that Bitcoiners consider Bitcoin to be 80% complete, but Ethereans consider Ethereum to be 40% complete.‚Äù And that Ethereum will reach 55% after a long-awaited merge, where it will shift from proof of work to proof of stake.

Vitalik Butterin said that ""in the medium to long term ZK rollups will win out in all use cases as ZK-SNARK technology improves."" (https://vitalik.ca/general/2021/01/05/rollup.html#conclusion). It means that he truly believes in the power of zk proofs technology. He thinks that they may be the best answer to scale Ethereum.
So, instead of just ""watching"" other teams working on it, why don't Ethereum core developers work on a such implementation?

- Is it because they need to focus on the move to Ethereum 2.0 ?
- Is it because the true nature of L1 is different from the nature of L2, in terms of ethos, principles, vision, etc. ?  And so they would just prefer to focus on other things?

I still see ‚ÄúETH 2.0‚Äù being thrown around. It is just not a thing anymore. The Foundation has changed up the nomenclature and marketing surrounding the Ethereum roadmap.,"I‚Äôm surprised as to how many people are still confused about this. So here are some footnotes.Ethereum‚Äôs roadmap has a lot of upgrades but the most significant two will be merging and Sharding.

# 

# - Oh no! What will happen to my staked ETH?

Don‚Äôt worry about that. When the merge with beacon chain happens (Ethereum going from PoW to PoS which was originally marketed as ETH2.0) the number one priority will be enabling withdrawals. The merge happen anytime soon now, with withdrawals scheduled for \~6 months after the merge is fully complete

# 

# - Gas Concerns

Gas on Ethereum itself is never going to be cheap.  It is a reality that we have to live with.  In fact, lately gas has been about as cheap as it ever will be moving forward.

# - The Merge and Gas

It is a misconception that the merge will lower gas fees. It will not. I mean, block validation times will get reduced by around a second or so, but that will only have very minimal and irrelevant effects on gas prices.

# 

# - Sharding and Gas

Sharding, which was originally designed to reduce gas across the board, has been changed. The Ethereum roadmap is now fully layer-2 (more precisely rollup) centric, and with that danksharding will be the way forward.

Again, Ethereum itself won‚Äôt be affected by this. What Sharding will do however is drastically help L2s lower their already low gas fees even further.But that‚Äôs alright because Ethereum is fully adopting L2s and scaling solutions as part of the blockchain.

As a reaction to that, we‚Äôre starting to see a lot of funds and developments being applied by Ethereum scaling solutions. already seeing some scaling solutions like Polygon alone is already sitting on a massive arsenal of scaling solutions with 8 of them ready to scale Ethereum and an open source zkEVM on the way that will help Solidity developers benefit from Ethereum‚Äôs security and Polygon‚Äôs efficiency.

Sharding will most likely arrive and be fully implemented in 2023 - 2024 so hang in there. (This is considering that everything goes as planned and no delays happen, which is usually not the case).

&#x200B;

There will also be further network optimization planned down the line. All of them are designed for the goal of further reducing gas costs and making Ethereum a much more efficient network overall.",262.0,2022-07-29 16:12:23,0.86

"The Merge is just around the corner, how's everyone feeling?","Just to preface before the haters fly in, I own Ethereum and support the project, I am discussing the merge and going over consensus algos voicing my thoughts and opinions.

With the merge coming up there's been a ton of discussion about PoS, how will it work, what are the benefits, why did they swap, etc. PoS is a consensus system implemented to continue the scalability of Etherreum (you can find a million sources to explain it), I understand why the choice was made and respect it, but for the sake of discussion I wanted to talk about other consensus algos.

Proof of Work (PoW) is what Ethereum is currently using, the same as BTC. You mine the token, receive it, and do whatever you want. Wanna earn more tokens, spend more money on mining equipment to mine more tokens, pretty straight forward. The benefits are large holders would need to invest millions upon millions in equipment to hold a large market share. Not only this, PoW also has the possibility of mining invalid blocks which lead to a loss.

To keep it simple, PoS eliminates one of the biggest downsides to PoW which is the equipment expense. Obtain the token and stake it to receive more and support the network. The issue however, is that large holders may simply stake their Ethereum for as long as they want, controlling a large market share and reducing the rewards for everyone involved. The more people stake, the worse the rewards.

Aside from PoW and PoS, there's also other consensus algorithms like Analog's Proof-Of-Time (PoT) concept which uses a ranking score and time-based technology to validate their nodes. Potentially preventing hacks more efficiently than other mechanisms. Solanas Proof-Of-History (PoH) consensus that utilizes time stamps to validate events and transactions, and then hashing them to make inputs difficult to predict, etc.

The issues with other options of course are things like security of the network itself, the technology may be flawed, and of course, the lack of decentralization.

Regardless, I wanted to know what everyone thinks. Is PoS the best option for the merge? If so, then why? Could there have been another route Ethereum took to evolve? Let me know your opinions",320.0,2022-07-28 01:48:07,0.87
"I built a ""decentralized facebook connect"" powered by blockchain wallets, 100% open source.","Hi Reddit, just wanted to share a project I've been working on. It's called Privateparty:

https://privateparty.dev

It's like Facebook connect, but decentralized. Instead of using a centralized identity system like Facebook to log into an app, this framework lets you easily add blockchain wallet based authentication and authorization to any web app, effortlessly. And it's super simple to use, just a couple of lines of code.

And most importantly, it's 100% open source (MIT licensed) and permissionless --- there is NO proprietary API or service provider you need to rely on.

Just to be clear, this is different from the typical ""connect with wallet"" feature in that it's not just about connecting a frontend with a wallet to make transactions, but it actually ""logs you in"" to any backend app with cookies and token authentication, and you can login once and keep using the session, just like any regular web app.

Things you can do:

1. NFT gated apps
2. ERC20 gated apps
3. Allow list authorized apps
4. A regular login experience, just replacing username/password with wallet login
5. Anything. you can build your own authorization logic with just a few lines of code.

This list can also be found in my repository [here](https://github.com/pcaversaccio/reentrancy-attacks).

I also think I found the first (10 Jun 2016) reentrancy attack contract available on GitHub [here](https://gist.github.com/vessenes/9d84df668893c43dcd968ee28a03cd2b). This contract was built by Peter Vessenes who was raising the issue to the Solidity/DAO team.

Finally, for anyone interested in the history behind the first reentrancy attack I really recommend checking out [issue 1](https://github.com/pcaversaccio/reentrancy-attacks/issues/1) in my reentrancy-attacks list repo; awesome historical insights!

"Since zkEVM has been a hot topic the past couple of weeks, let‚Äôs talk about it. What is zkEVM?","I‚Äôve seen more than a couple zkEVM related posts on this sub the past couple weeks and apparently there‚Äôs a considerable number of people that don‚Äôt fully understand what zkEVM.

For this purpose, I won‚Äôt be using complicated and complex technical words as a lot of people didn‚Äôt understand them.

I‚Äôll be using more of a ‚Äúlayman‚Äôs terms‚Äù kind of explanation just to help people understand what zkEVM is/does before they personally dive into technicals

(Would love to make another post that dives deep into technical terms and explanations if you guys demand one).

&#x200B;

So let‚Äôs start!We first have to understand

# - What is a rollup?

There are two ways to scale Ethereum.(Channels or Sidechains)

Channels are full secured by Ethereum however they work well for only a very specific set of applications.

Sidechains on the other hand can scale general purpose applications however they are less secure than layer 2 solutions as they don‚Äôt rely on the security of Ethereum but rather on their own consensus model.

Rollups (the vast majority of them) can achieve the best of what Channels and Sidechains have to offer while eliminating the drawbacks that come along with them by creating a general purpose scaling solutions while still full relying on Ethereum‚Äôs security.

&#x200B;

# - What is zero-knowledge (ZK)?

A zero-knowledge rollup (as the name implies) offers users a lot more privacy when doing transactions. The way the technology is built allows validators to prove that ‚Äúyes this transaction is legit and true‚Äù without having to disclose private or sensitive information to said validators.

To make it simple I‚Äôll give out a fun exampleYou and your friend are standing in front of two rooms. These two rooms have a connecting door from the inside but that door is protected by a code that only you know.

You want to show your friend that you know the code but you don‚Äôt want to share the code with him. Based on this, you go inside one room, close the door behind you and press the code for the connecting door which leads you to the other room, thus proving to your friend that you do indeed know the code without having to disclose the actual code for him.

Its a fun example that helps you understand why zero-knowledge is so important. It‚Äôs all about benefiting from the quickness and efficiency of rollups while also benefiting from the privacy that ZK offers.

# - What is EVM?

EVM is an acronym for ‚ÄúEthereum Virtual Machine‚Äù. It is the software machine for the Ethereum‚Äôs network.EVM basically allows developers to create smart contracts using the Solidity coding language.

So why is everyone so psyched about EVM equivalence? Because it comes with huge advantages. Mainly things like compatibility with Metamask wallets, and the fact that it makes devs‚Äô jobs much easier since they‚Äôre already familiar with Solidity

&#x200B;

# - Some names to mention regarding zkEVM are (I‚Äôll have to mention some technical words here, sorry):

zkSync and Polygon Hermez

Now I have to say that although zkSync has had their zkEVM testnet live for months, it is closed source which sadly defeats the entire purpose of zkEVM.

Polygon Hermez on the other hand is open source which is great for the Ethereum chain and developers.

There‚Äôs been some recent controversy regarding Polygon zkEVM being EVM-compatible and not EVM-equivalent. The main argument is that if you're a developer a few functions breaking over not being 100% equivalent may result in a dApp crashing. However, this argument is irrelevant for a simply reason.

Hermez is bytecode equivalent. They run that bytecode on their own custom zkASM.  That allows direct compatibility with existing dApps. Those dApps should run without any problem since they‚Äôre completely bytecode equivalent. This might be extra work for the nodes to put in to validate and write the block that isn't equivalent but it really shouldn‚Äôt be a problem. Main argument is that the devs can't literally copy paste their code off Ethereum, but they literally shouldn't do that anywhere, there should be always revisions when migrating contracts to make sure everything goes smoothly.What Polygon is doing is of great value for Ethereum and its ecosystem and devs overall.

Phew! That might have been the longest post I‚Äôve written but I really hope that it gives people a quick idea idea about what zkEVM is and why it‚Äôs so important for Ethereum.

Again, this was all in layman‚Äôs terms but I‚Äôd love to follow up with a post that dives into technicalities if popular demand says so.",254.0,2022-07-25 13:23:06,0.92
How web3 protocols built on Ethereum can solve web2 social media issues,"[Article](https://medium.com/@0xAlfon/how-web3-can-solve-social-media-issues-434167c4b1fc)

In summary web3 would solve:

1. Opening the social graph and descentralisation can help limiting algorithm manipulation and empowering users to take control over their social graph and social footprint.

2. By storing relationships and activity on chain, users can monitor and monetise their activity without intermediators. For instance, apps built on top of Lens Protocol (desgined by¬†Aave¬†team) can provide monetisation solutions to users curating content. This opens a new asset class.

3. Bots can manipulate the graph and artificially generate social content, provoke tensions, or produce fake traffic. Digital IDs can help to limit the activity of programs and algorithms simulating human behaviour providing reliable private digital identities.",54.0,2022-07-24 19:27:19,0.84

Decentralized ETH?,"When people criticize ETH not being decentralized, what are they referring to? And what's the counterargument that it is in fact decentralized?",33.0,2022-07-24 10:57:45,0.84
"Ethereum was created for a real purpose, not for dog coins and pictures of monkeys‚Ä¶","I‚Äôm not going to name drop any tokens in particular to not p#ss off a certain group of people but I think we all know that memecoins serve no real purpose and derive no real value other than community hype and nothing more. This is a fact and it is undisputed.

I really don‚Äôt want to be that guy that says ‚Äúthis money would be better off invested in XYZ‚Äù. Its not about greed and ‚Äúfunds‚Äù in particular. Its more about development.

Vitalik created this blockchain to serve a purpose. To fight against tyranny and give regular human beings a tool to leverage financial freedom through decentralization and smart contracts.

This might be considered subjective to some people but DeFi and DAOs have much more value than a token with a dog face on it.

When you can use AAVE to take out a loan  anytime of the day regardless of you location, ethnicity, gender or age, that give Ethereum value. When there are platforms like Bitdao where the community governs itself and votes for what they see fit for themselves as holder, that reinforces Ethereum‚Äôs decentralization ideals.

It‚Äôs a bit ironic of me to be talking about ‚Äúfreedom‚Äù and ‚Äúdecentralization‚Äù while at the same time condoning memecoins and hypecoins, I know.  
I‚Äôm not advocating against these coins entirely, I just think that obsession over them defeats the main purpose of Ethereum.

Technically you could use Ethereum for anything (and that‚Äôs what makes it so valuable) but I think it makes much more sense to use it in a utilitarian way.

Zero Knowledge Proofs is HUGE (via Pete Huang),"Big day yesterday! Three blockchain teams made announcements all in one day!  


All of them working on solutions that use zero-knowledge proofs (that thing I said would change blockchain forever):  


1. Polygon announced Polygon zkEVM  
2. Scroll announced their pre-alpha  
3. zkSync announced they are ""100 days away"" from full launch  


Ok, so they're not \*real\* announcements since one of them announced a comically early version of their product and another announced that... they will announce the actual thing later(?)  


Stick with me here. Let me dive into the significance of these milestones so that we can make sense of why these products are important.  


**Part 1:** Ethereum is really slow. 35 transactions per second. There's this idea that we can use ""rollups"" to scale Ethereum: these are separate blockchains that specialize in packing a ton of transactions into 1 of those 35 so that Ethereum can process more stuff at once.  


**Part 2:** Zero-knowledge proofs are one way to implement those rollups. They essentially calculate some crazy math and send that math to Ethereum. Ethereum checks the math (which is way, way faster than checking the actual stuff that happened) and says, ""Ok cool, I'm gonna fast forward the tape!""  


**Part 3:** But the rollups are limited right now. Specifically, the rollups are either designed for very specific use cases (e.g., exchanges and nothing else) or you have to use a different type of computer than the one Ethereum uses (which can be really complicated).  


For these types of rollups to work well, we need to build one that thinks like Ethereum's computer thinks, while supporting every use case that Ethereum can support, while supporting the same programming language that Ethereum supports, while spitting out that crazy math.  


Whew.  


But that's what these teams are working on. The ""Ethereum computer"" is called the EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine) and these teams are working on zkEVMs - EVMs with zero-knowledge proofs (that crazy math) embedded.  


Each has a different approach to writing these zkEVMs. For example, one approach is to make each individual command in the EVM spit out a zk version of that individual command. Another approach is to literally rewrite each individual command to a zk verison.  


**The summary:** finally, we'll have a zero-knowledge rollup that scales Ethereum, is easy-to-use by developers (they can literally copy and paste code instead of having to rewrite it) and supports any use case (vs. existing ones that only do certain things).  


The infrastructure continues to improve!

**Frequently Asked Questions**

**Where's the best place to buy ETH?**

There are many centralized exchanges that support Ethereum. If you live in the US, the most popular exchanges are Coinbase, Gemeni and Kraken. Coinbase users can use Coinbase Pro for lower fees.

**When is Eth2 launching?**

Eth2 is a marketing term used to represent a number of updates to Ethereum. The Eth2 proof-of-stake chain first launched in December 2020. ""The Merge"", which is the event that will fully switch Ethereum's consensus to proof-of-stake, is estimated to be ready in early 2022, although there is no exact timeline. Other updates, such as data shards, will follow that update.

Visit [ethmerge.com](https://ethmerge.com/) to learn more about ""The Merge"".

**Do I need to do anything to update to Eth2? Will Eth2 create a new token?**

No, ETH holders *never* need to take any action to keep holding ETH. Ethereum users will be unaffected by the Eth2 upgrade. And the Eth2 updates will not create any new tokens.

**How can I stake my ETH?**

The best way to stake your ETH: by running your own validator.

* Running your own validator requires a modern computer and 32 ETH. Visit /r/ethstaker for more details

**Why are Ethereum transaction fees so high?**

Like most blockchains, Ethereum fees are determined by supply-and-demand. The large demand to use Ethereum has pushed transaction fees quite high (however, fees were just a few cents only 2 years ago). Fees are especially high during market volatility, and during NFT drops.

**What is being done to lower Ethereum transaction fees?**

Ethereum fees are reduced by using layer-2 rollups. Rollups are scaling solutions that allow for significantly cheaper transactions, while still maintaining Ethereum's security.

Additionally, Eth2's data shards will make rollups even cheaper.

While rollups are cutting-edge technology being actively developed, a number are already live on Ethereum mainnet. Visit [l2beat.com](https://l2beat.com/) to learn more about rollups.

**What's the best wallet for Ethereum?**

The most popular tool for using decentralized applications is Metamask. However, for security reasons, we recommend using a hardware wallet such as a Trezor or Ledger.

‚ÄúETH killers‚Äù will start losing relevancy once zkEVM gets fully integrated by every major scaling solution,"There‚Äôs no doubt that Ethereum is the gold standard of decentralization, reliability, and ecosystem diversity when it comes to blockchains. However, its main drawback ever since it went popular was efficiency with time and gas fees.

‚ÄúETH killers‚Äù profit off of this and basically make their only selling point centered around efficiency even if that‚Äôs at the price of decentralization or ecosystem diversity. And apparently, some people found that appealing because some of these projects found success to some extent.

However, this will all change slowly but surely. Down the line, we‚Äôll start seeing a completely different Ethereum that will morph into a blockchain that is way more efficient than we got used to and this is all due to the major ZK technology development that we‚Äôre seeing.

Loopring and Starware have very exciting developments in the zero-knowledge department that many fans are waiting for.

Polygon has also had major breakthroughs with zkEVM development and will soon be dropping Hermez 2.0 which will help Ethereum scale like nothing before. This is also not mentioning the Plonky2 tech which will apparently be the fastest in terms of transaction speed by a long shot.

All of the efforts of these scaling solutions combined will make Ethereum unrecognizable to us and will eventually shut up the critics. But most importantly, the developments in the zkEVM field will make claims of an ‚ÄúETH killer‚Äù something of the past.",349.0,2022-07-13 08:28:09,0.83
"Founders Of Bankrupt Crypto Hedge Fund 3AC Go Missing, As Investors Try To Recoup Assets"," The co-founders of failed crypto hedge fund Three Arrows Capital appear to be on the run from creditors, according to court documents recently filed in New York.

The documents, filed Friday evening, also allege that the founders have not yet begun to cooperate with the liquidation process ‚Äúin any meaningful manner.‚Äù On Monday, lawyers requested the court keep the identity of the creditors anonymous.

Zhu and Davies did not respond to requests for comment.

Three Arrows, also known as 3AC, managed about $10 billion in assets as recently as March. On July 1, the firm filed for Chapter 15 bankruptcy protection from U.S. creditors in the Southern District of New York, after a plunge in cryptocurrencies and the collapse of the terraUSD (UST) stablecoin project wiped out its assets.

Prior to the bankruptcy filing, a court in the British Virgin Islands ordered the beleaguered fund to liquidate in order to pay back its debts.

What was the best strategy for whales providing single-sided liquidity on Bancor?," 

Recently the pioneers of AMM and impermanent loss protection have been in huge trouble. Their impermanent loss protection has led to a huge deficit, over $40 million at its peak, and still has a deficit of $34,242,036 today. In the process, some people want to ask what was the best strategy for whales or retail investors providing single-sided liquidity on Bancor? Here are a few options, so you can decide which is best:

1) Just holding until removing liquidity forever;

2) Removing and re-adding when there is a large fluctuation;

3) Removing and re-adding when there is a large fluctuation, and shorting BNT at the same time.

I think many people actually choose 1, and smart investors may choose 2. But the best option is actually 3 for whales. For example, the crisis of BNT is due to the selling and shorting BNT by whales while removing single-sided liquidity. The whales were rewarded by a large number of BNT causing the price to plummet while sold; At the same time shorting also makes an additional profit for them. So this is the best strategy for whales to provide liquidity on bancor. As we all know, the inflation of BNT is calculated as followed:

Indicating that you can get BNT rewards for any price fluctuations.

So strategy 2 should be better selected for ordinary investors. It can be obtained double BNT rewards in the fluctuation, which maximizes the benefits.

A Slow Unexpected Death for Mirror.xyz: Mirror Investment Memo,"Despite raising capital from Tier 1 VCs such as Union Square Ventures, Andreessen Horozwitz, Atelier Ventures (now part of Variant Fund) the platform seems to be dying a slow death. 

Whilst Mirror got off to a great start with $WRITE RACE driving FOMO and onboarding some of the most respected names in crypto including Jarrod Dicker, Linda Xie, Coophatroppa and Chris Dixon their performance has struggled recently.¬†

Since opening up the platform (October 13th, 2021), Mirror has seen disappointing growth in the number of writers of its platform ‚Äì going from 380 to 607 writers. This represents ‚âà60% in 7.5 months or 6.45% MoM. Contrast this to Substack, Mirror's web2 counterparty that has ‚Äò*hundreds of thousands of* ***paid*** *newsletters on the platform‚Äô* according to The Times. 

The situation becomes bleaker when digging deeper on Dune and comparing them to Juicebox.eth, a crypto fundraising platform. Whilst Juicebox may be less well known and have a less diverse product line-up they are significantly outperforming their competition.

[https:\/\/henryberry.substack.com\/p\/mirror-investment-memo-a-struggling ](https://preview.redd.it/5srxpzedz0a91.png?width=882&format=png&auto=webp&s=906192cd1eb588702a6926141c92d87e63ae633d)

Given all this let‚Äôs have a look into Mirror‚Äôs market size & opportunity to try and assess the problem.

&#x200B;

**Market Size & Opportunity**

Fundamentally I believe this is where Mirror‚Äôs problems lie. Right now Mirror positions itself as a publishing platform which is limiting. We‚Äôve seen that companies like Substack, despite far greater adoption are generating disappointing revenue ($9m in 2021) and have struggled to raise a Series C.

https://preview.redd.it/597mjxpjz0a91.png?width=1456&format=png&auto=webp&s=343e28c718d9d3112709c8259777830eec22e05a

So whilst the ‚ÄòContent Creation‚Äô market TAMs are extremely attractive (projected to reach $38.2 billion by 2030) this comes with major caveats.

1. This includes far more popular means including VOD (YouTube) and Live Streaming (Twitch)
2. We‚Äôve seen that the media industry is a pretty horrible business for venture capital
3. Substack shows there is not a massive market for supporting individual writers

However, Mirror may be missing a trick. I think there is a far greater market opportunity if they were to position themselves as a tool to raise money (for personal projects or crypto businesses).

&#x200B;

**The Crowdfunding Market** 

Over recent years we‚Äôve seen the popularisation of private market investing whether through the likes of Kickstarter, investment DAOs, angel investing or new start-ups like SeedInvest & EquityZen.

The crowdfunding market alone is estimated at $12.27 billion globally and is forecasted to double by 2027, growing at a CAGR of 11%. Crypto, in my opinion, will enable and accelerate this (look to ‚ÄúBusiness as a Game‚Äù by Not Boring).

So, where should Mirror go from here?

Understanding data availability for zk rollups,"My understanding is that if a zkrollup operator suddenly ceases operation, you have to sync the rollup‚Äôs history from genesis to get the current state. In other words, if the transaction data has been posted to 500 ethereum blocks, you would need all the data from all 500 blocks to recreate current state. Is this correct?

If that's correct, how do we make sense of Ethereum's eventual plan to only make data available for a few weeks and then prune? Wouldn't the data need to be made available indefinitely (because you need all data from genesis to recreate the zkrollup state)?

The loss of BNT impermanent loss protection is even larger than the loss of market price fluctuation,"Recently, bancor as the pioneer of AMM and impermanent loss protection has been in huge trouble with huge deficits over $40 million at its peak due to hostile market conditions. As we all know normal impermanent loss is just only 20% even with 80% price down, which is why the author said that the impermanence loss protection of bancor exceeds the impermanence loss itself. If you are interested, you can refer to the previous analysis article.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/g77bd7qky3991.png?width=865&format=png&auto=webp&s=7000c159ea2e13411a12eef4ab0c423d317bc14f

But some people want to know which is bigger for the loss of impermanent loss protection and market price fluctuations? We know that the volatility loss of the market is ML(%)=P0/Pn-1, that is, we need to compare the sizes of the following two formulas:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/lxgp5s6rw3991.png?width=480&format=png&auto=webp&s=eb93649e3d4d07d89769e5a963be5eb6b347a2cb

wherein P0 is the initial price and Pn is the current price.

As can be seen from the figure below, when Pn/P0<0.3, the loss of impermanent loss protection will exceed the loss of price fluctuations. And the loss of impermanent loss protection is as high as 250% which is far exceeding the decreasing of BNT price just only 85% from April 3 to July 2. Therefore, the loss of BNT impermanent loss protection is not only higher than impermanent loss itself, but also would even exceed the decline in market prices. Under extreme conditions, the hyperinflation of BNT will increase exponentially, and you may lose all your capital.

There‚Äôs no deny that certain L2s and scaling solutions are simply better than the other be it because of more funding, longer time in the market or a better development team over all.

I personally root a lot for Polygon considering that they have the most funding and liquidity out of all other scaling solutions (and thats apparent by their allocation of $1 billion toward ZK tech development) plus they also have more than 8 Ethereum scaling solutions each with its specific purpose. Finally they already secured a ton of partnerships with major global companies the likes of Instagram, Stripe and recently Bentley.

My love for this scaling solution does NOT disregard other L2s and scaling solutions. I know that they are JUST AS IMPORTANT as this one. I just happen to support Polygon more.

North Korean Hackers Reportedly Behind the $100 Million Harmony Exploit,"
The Lazarus Group, a notorious North Korean hacking group, is suspected of attacking the cryptocurrency protocol Harmony. The criminal organization has been involved in a number of similar heists in recent years and there has no been an ideal way of tracing crypto transaction with ideas like ID recognition presented forward by Concordium not generally adopted. 

Harmony revealed last week that wrongdoers breached its Horizon Bridge and drained approximately $100 million in Ethereum. Harmony's team quickly launched a ""global manhunt"" for the perpetrators of the attack. 

According to Bloomberg, Elliptic Enterprises, a firm that tracks stolen digital assets, stated that the exploit was most likely carried out by the Lazarus Group (a cybercrime entity backed by the North Korean state). According to the company, the laundering methods were very similar to previous hacking maneuvers: ""There are strong indications that North Korea‚Äôs Lazarus Group may be responsible for this theft, based on the nature of the hack and the subsequent laundering of the stolen funds.‚Äù

Elliptic also went into great detail about how the heist was carried out. To breach the protocol's security system, the Lazarus Group targeted the username and password credentials of Harmony employees in the Asia Pacific region. Once in control, the criminals used automated laundering services to move the stolen assets at night. 

Elliptic also claimed that the hacking group had already transferred more than 40% of the $100 million to a Tornado Cash mixer. According to a recent Coincub study, North Korea is by far the top-ranked nation for crypto crime. Between 2017 and 2022, skilled hackers from the totalitarian country targeted governments and private companies all over the world, stealing more than $1.5 billion in digital assets. Despite repeated warnings and harsh sanctions, Pyongyang has maintained its ballistic missile infrastructure: ‚ÄúDPRK demonstrated increased capabilities for rapid deployment, wide mobility (including at sea), and improved resilience of its missile forces.‚Äù  Unsurprisingly, Russia and China refused to sign the UN statement, which accuses North Korea of using stolen crypto assets to fund its nuclear tests.",411.0,2022-06-30 18:15:22,0.93

So I thought it was the same as every other generic wallet app like Coin98 Wallet or SimpleHold wallet.

üçÑ Stereum is a tool to manage the process of setting up & maintaining an Ethereum node for you with a heavy focus on self sovereignty, privacy and flexibility.  Stereum is completely Open Source and developed with an MIT license, which means you can use it to build your own modified version from our code basis (and use it for whatever you like)

üçÑ Stereum 2.0 aims to be the most flexible way to leverage your Ethereum node for $ETH staking, data science, development or your own personal use case.  We hope to explore every hermit‚Äôs dream with you!

üçÑ With Stereum you are able to participate in the Ethereum network and its various protocols (like SSV)!

&#x200B;

**Current State**

Currently we are supporting Staking on testnet as well as creating a testnet Node Operator for the SSV network ([https://ssv.network/](https://ssv.network/))  As you can see from the video, there is still **a ton left to do,** **a lot of components/features** we are planning to implement missing and polish to apply before we can think of a full release.

**Frequently Asked Questions**

**Where's the best place to buy ETH?**

There are many centralized exchanges that support Ethereum. If you live in the US, the most popular exchanges are Coinbase, Gemeni and Kraken. Coinbase users can use Coinbase Pro for lower fees.

**When is Eth2 launching?**

Eth2 is a marketing term used to represent a number of updates to Ethereum. The Eth2 proof-of-stake chain first launched in December 2020. ""The Merge"", which is the event that will fully switch Ethereum's consensus to proof-of-stake, is estimated to be ready in early 2022, although there is no exact timeline. Other updates, such as data shards, will follow that update.

Visit [ethmerge.com](https://ethmerge.com/) to learn more about ""The Merge"".

**Do I need to do anything to update to Eth2? Will Eth2 create a new token?**

No, ETH holders *never* need to take any action to keep holding ETH. Ethereum users will be unaffected by the Eth2 upgrade. And the Eth2 updates will not create any new tokens.

**How can I stake my ETH?**

The best way to stake your ETH: by running your own validator.

* Running your own validator requires a modern computer and 32 ETH. Visit /r/ethstaker for more details

**Why are Ethereum transaction fees so high?**

Like most blockchains, Ethereum fees are determined by supply-and-demand. The large demand to use Ethereum has pushed transaction fees quite high (however, fees were just a few cents only 2 years ago). Fees are especially high during market volatility, and during NFT drops.

**What is being done to lower Ethereum transaction fees?**

Ethereum fees are reduced by using layer-2 rollups. Rollups are scaling solutions that allow for significantly cheaper transactions, while still maintaining Ethereum's security.

Additionally, Eth2's data shards will make rollups even cheaper.

While rollups are cutting-edge technology being actively developed, a number are already live on Ethereum mainnet. Visit [l2beat.com](https://l2beat.com/) to learn more about rollups.

**What's the best wallet for Ethereum?**

The most popular tool for using decentralized applications is Metamask. However, for security reasons, we recommend using a hardware wallet such as a Trezor or Ledger.

permissoned zkRollup with private smart contract?,"Hey guys!

Recently, I deal with ETH scalability solutions and I started to read more about zkRollup. All found solutions are permissionless and do not deal with privacy (except Zcash which allows anonymous transactions).

In my opinion, zkRollup can be easily used as a permissioned/consortium system. The basic implementation to make this kind of system is not a big deal. My main problem is privacy and group handling.

Except for the global public state (public contracts), each group has to deal with its own contracts and do its own zk proof generation. Thus, it seems to be an enormous waste. I do not think it is a good approach to the problem. Sidechains and plasma can be a better choice.

Requirements: the new system has to be capable of transferring (mainnet's) Ethereum assets, executing public/private smart contracts, and storing some states or proof on the mainnet.

What is your opinion about this idea?

Is private smart contract a possible thing in a permissionless or permissioned context?

Thanks a lot!

Zero-knowledge tech is way more private than optimistic tech. This is exactly we‚Äôre seeing more ZK development on Ethereum,"This doesn‚Äôt mean that optimistic tech is bad. On the contrary, as opposed to what many think, optimistic tech will ALWAYS be an important and integral part of Ethereum and will never go away.

However, it does lack a little when it comes to privacy. Compared to zero-knowledge, optimistic tech isn‚Äôt as private considering that validators have access to the information related to you/your transactions.

This isn‚Äôt the case with zero-knowledge. Validators have the minimal needed amount of information needed to validate a transaction in a way that can‚Äôt be linked to you as a person, hence the name ‚Äúzero-knowledge‚Äù because all transactions looks the same to a validator, they just have to confirm if the transaction is valid or not.

Zero-knowledge doesn‚Äôt only stop at crypto transactions though. Some platforms like Polygon took it a step further and integrated into identification through Polygon ID.

Its currently a bit difficult to prove your identity without having to disclose sensitive information. But zero-knowledge solves that. With ZK-proof any user can prove that ‚Äúyes this is me‚Äù without having without having to disclose personal information.  
This is a HUGE use case that crypto projects can benefit from as there‚Äôs still no solutions for this problem outside of the crypto space and this is exactly what Polygon is capitalizing on with Polygon ID. You can literally use it verify your identity anywhere from Metaverse ecosystems, real world business, social media, Fintech services and platforms that require KYC.

You know what this means right? With Ethereum being famous for extreme secure, zero-knowledge will soon attract institutions and businesses into the crypto world bringing a ton of new money into the market and more specifically Ethereum!",354.0,2022-06-23 09:32:29,0.9
Did the Metaverse hype come at the wrong time?," We all know that everything is down and not going well in the meantime and [Metaverse projects](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethtrader/comments/uengau/different_crypto_metaverse_projects_everywhere/) and [Meme coins](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/slyrih/shit_coins/) that I am aware of, suffered the most losses in May.  Because metaverse projects are still relatively new, it appears that the hype for meta projects is occurring at an inconvenient time, such as when NFTs and P2Es boomed. Yuga labs experienced this because after they dropped the Otherside Metaverse, the price dropped significantly after a week last month. Some people in third-world countries even used it as their primary source of income, but the bear market is making everyone shit their pants right now. Even the $20k support was recently broken, and ETH fell below $1000 for the first time since 2021.   
Decentralized metaverse projects took advantage of the popularity of Play-to-Earn as well as the hype surrounding virtual worlds to create their digital realms prior to the announcements of tech titans in this field. Decentraland, in fact, is a pioneer in this space, having opened its metaverse to the public in February 2020. Another popular solution, Sandbox, debuted its first multiplayer alpha season in November 2021. A lot of great Metaverse projects are incoming as well with great features like Kirin‚Äôs open-source platform that will provide Learn to earn, Play to earn, etc, that are made for gamers and devs, and Star Atlas‚Äôs graphics and gaming experience. But sadly, the popularity of Metaverses just increased much more recently than P2Es.  
But the question is, will the bear market have a massive effect on the development of great Metaverse projects? At this rate, I realized many altcoins will probably not make it, on the other hand, the bear market serves an even more important function in the crypto industry: they are when the greatest and most successful projects are built.

I feel like no one outside of our industry actually understands blockchain tech,"I've been noticing this for a while: but everyone in tech who doesn't work in the blockchain industry seems to be critical of the tech. Yet when you read their critiques they fail to touch on anything that the tech is being used for.

For example someone could say: 'look at escrow contracts. Why bother with that. It's far cheaper and faster just to use lawyers.' This would be a targeted critique because it would be focusing on something particular to blockchain tech. After-all, you can't take a piece of regular money and write a set of conditions for using it.

What we get instead seems to be cherry picked arguments about bad things that have happened in the crypto industry, generalizations there-of, fallacies, and a complete lack of understanding about what the tech is about (if you want to see how many uninformed people there are look no further than [http://concerned.tech/](http://concerned.tech/).)

A good case in point is the repeat claim that 'blockchains have no use-cases.' But what this means is the person is fundamentally so uneducated about the tech that they don't even know the basics. Consequently, the only way to address such a person would be to write a huge post starting from the fundamentals of digital property, smart contracts, decentralized \[systems, organisations, etc\] each time someone makes the claim (which is very impractical.)

I think what we need is for someone to make a post that lists a bunch of use-cases in simple terms, current unique projects in the space \[representative there-of\], along with the over-all philosophy and goals. Then we can just link to it every time someone posts these misleading claims. Because people are just going to assume that because no one is taking the effort to educate outsiders about the massive amounts of industry-specific knowledge it indicates there is none. These people then go and write article after article and form self-congratulatory echo chambers of ignoramuses.

Anyway, if there are any good technical writers here or bloggers: I think this would be a great thing to write for the community. Just my opinion.

Gas fees are at record lows. Imagine that after Sharding is introduced this will become the norm,"Consistently low gas fees have always been a dream to many people on Ethereum and right now its starting to look more like a reality that will happen in due time.

Gas fees have been a plague to Ethereum and always have been one of the major criticisms regarding Ethereum‚Äôs performance. And this is exactly why I‚Äôm so bullish on Sharding.  
This will make Ethereum much more sustainable and operable without having to compromise security.

If you think you like the low gas fees right now then imagine if this actually became the norm.

This might come sooner rather than later and it‚Äôs starting to look apparent by how much development has been happening with some scalability leaders like Polygon. They‚Äôre shifting a lot of their funds and efforts towards Zk development right now which isn‚Äôt really a surprise considering Ethereum will be following a Zk rollup centric roadmap as Vitalik once noted.

In fact, the majority of scaling solutions like Zksync, Loopring and Starkware are also very Zk centric.

"Whoever has doubts about Ethereum‚Äôs future‚Ä¶ calm down, it still has a ton of development on the way from merging to sharding to much more","Call me biased if you want but I don‚Äôt think any other blockchain is as consistent and safe as Ethereum especially when you take into consideration that it has the most diverse and rich ecosystem in the entire market.

The only people who have fears are the ones that still aren‚Äôt used to how the market moves in times like this, but the reality is that this might be one of the most bullish phases for Ethereum considering how much development is on the way.

The merge isn‚Äôt that far away right now and it will make Ethereum WAY more efficient with around 99% less energy consumption.

Sharding will come after that and will basically put all scaling solutions on steroids, especially ones that are ZK-based.

It's no wonder why so many L2s and scaling solutions are starting to shift towards ZK tech, a lot of them starting t develop some neat stuff. Polygon out of all been at the forefront of ZK development with more than $1 billion allocated just for that and even 4 ZK-based scaling solutions in their arsenal right now.

This will make gas fees a redundant issue and will make Ethereum unrecognizable. So if you‚Äôve always liked Ethereum then you‚Äôre going to love it pretty soon.

Why Bridging Ethereum Domains is So Damn Difficult,"#  Bridging Ethereum

This post will attempt to explain why interoperability between Ethereum domains is difficult, and from there show why we think NXTP represents the beginning of a true long-term solution for the ecosystem. 

 NXTP - [protocol for enabling fully trustless transfers and contract calls between Ethereum-compatible domains](https://medium.com/connext/nxtp-a-simpler-xchain-protocol-88760697ea04) (domains = chains & L2s). 

# The Need for Trustless Ethereum Interoperability

Multichain/L2 Ethereum is here, and it‚Äôs here to stay. This has spurred the creation of dozens of new bridges and interoperability protocols as projects have scrambled to enable this functionality for DeFi.

As can be expected, this has also brought on a number of high profile hacks and scams:

* The multiple Thorchain hacks.
* The PolyNetwork hack.

Despite these examples, every bridging system out there markets itself as trustless, secure, and decentralized (even if that‚Äôs not at all the case). This means big challenge for developers and users is now, ‚Äúhow can I figure out which bridging mechanisms are actually cryptoeconomically secure?‚Äù

In other words, how can users discern between types of bridges to determine who they are trusting when moving funds between chains?

## What Does ‚ÄúTrustless‚Äù Actually Mean in Cryptoeconomics?

In the research community, when we talk about cryptoeconomic security and the property of trustlessness, we are really asking one very specific question:

>*Who is verifying the system and how much does it cost to corrupt them?*

If our goal is to build truly decentralized, uncensorable public goods, then we have to consider that our systems could be attacked by incredibly powerful adversaries like rogue sovereign nations, megacorporations, or megalomaniacal evil geniuses.

Maximizing security means maximizing the number and diversity of verifiers (validators, miners, etc.) in your system, and this typically means trying your best to have a system that is verified entirely by Ethereum‚Äôs validator set. This is the core idea behind L2 and Ethereum‚Äôs approach to scalability.

>*Aside: Most people don‚Äôt realize this, but scalability research is interoperability research. We‚Äôve known we can scale by moving to multiple domains for ages, the problem has always been how to enable communicating to those domains trustlessly. That‚Äôs why John Adler‚Äôs seminal paper on optimistic rollups is titled, ‚ÄúTrustless Two-Way Bridges With Sidechains By Halting‚Äù.*

## What Happens If We Add New Verifiers Between Domains?

Let‚Äôs take what we‚Äôve learned above about cryptoeconomic security and apply it to bridges.

https://preview.redd.it/mdawgg4atj691.png?width=757&format=png&auto=webp&s=7010e8a1e01f4a235b45db893caa2ed875e765c7

Consider a scenario where you have your funds on Arbitrum. You‚Äôve specifically chosen to use this domain because it is a rollup, meaning that (with some reasonable assumptions) your funds are fully secured by Ethereum‚Äôs underlying verifiers. In other words, your funds are about as cryptoeconomically secure as they can possibly be in the blockchain ecosystem.

Now imagine that you decide to use a bridge to move your funds cheaply and quickly to Optimism. Optimism is also trustless, so you feel comfortable having your funds there knowing that they will share the same level of security (Ethereum‚Äôs security) that they do on Arbitrum.

https://preview.redd.it/jrlpfozbtj691.png?width=751&format=png&auto=webp&s=2d651026edc6dab716b6f65bf9c0920080fdacc2

However, the bridge protocol that you use utilizes it‚Äôs own set of external verifiers. While this may not initially seem like a big deal, your funds are now no longer secured by Ethereum, but instead by the verifiers of the bridge:

* If this is a lock/mint bridge, creating wrapped assets, then the bridge verifiers can now unilaterally collude to steal all of your funds.
* If this is a bridge that uses liquidity pools, the bridge verifiers can similarly collude to steal all of the pool capital from LPs.

Despite having waited years for secure, trustless L2s, your situation is now the same as if you had used a trusted sidechain or L1 construction. 

The key takeaway is that cryptoeconomic systems are only as secure as their weakest link. When you use insecure bridges, it doesn‚Äôt matter how secure your chain or L2 is anymore. And, similar to the security of L1s and L2s, it all comes entirely down to one question: who is verifying the system?

## The Interoperability Trilemma

Now we get to the thesis of this article, and the mental model that should drive user and developer decisions around bridge selection.

https://preview.redd.it/x1lmxsqntj691.png?width=895&format=png&auto=webp&s=ebc222cd6dbc2692d66f8f1acf8bf09bc3f2bc26

Similar to the Scalability Trilemma, there exists an Interoperability Trilemma in the Ethereum ecosystem. Interop protocols can only have two of the following three properties:

* **Trustlessness:** having equivalent security to the underlying domains.
* **Extensibility:** able to be supported on any domain.
* **Generalizeability:** capable of handling arbitrary cross-domain data.

# How Do Connext and NXTP Fit Into This?

There‚Äôs no easy way for us to get all three desireable interoperability properties. We‚Äôve realized, however, that we can take the same approach to solving the Interoperability Trilemma that Ethereum does to solving the Scalability Trilemma.

Ethereum L1 optimizes for security and decentralization at the cost of scalability. The rationale behind this is that these properties are likely the most important for the longevity and utility of a blockchain. Ethereum then adds scalability via L2/sharding as a layer on top of an existing secure and decentralized backbone.

At Connext, we strongly believe that the interoperability system with the most longevity, utility, and adoptability in the Ethereum ecosystem will be one that is maximally trustless and extensible. For this reason, NXTP is a locally verified system specifically designed to be as secure as the underlying domains while still being usable on any domain.

So what about generalizeability? Similar to scalability in the Ethereum ecosystem, we can add generalizeability by plugging in natively verified protocols on top of NXTP (as a ‚ÄúLayer 2‚Äù of our interop network!). That way, users and developers get a consistent interface across any domain, and can ‚Äúupgrade‚Äù their connection to be generalized in cases where that functionality is available.

https://preview.redd.it/pxa92hqqtj691.png?width=772&format=png&auto=webp&s=8dbf291042c3d072bba827cdbad0f67558d43c8d

 This is why we say NXTP is the **base protocol** of our interoperability network. The full network will be made of up of a **stack** of protocols which will include NXTP, generalized crosschain bridges specific to a pair of domains, and protocols to connect them all together into one seamless system.

With the Cardano community we have also tried to stay focused around these concepts but as we get many new players sometimes we have this looming.

I just wanted to drop by and say kudos to the community. I am hoping for nothing but success with the Ethereum implementations and upgrades in the future. I think healthy competition is good. 

I am hoping in the future maybe the communities can see less tribalism and have the same competitive drive to beat out each other without making it personal. Keep up the good work.",93.0,2022-06-18 14:50:10,0.86
I thought Getting into Web3 would be a piece of Cake,"I was always fascinated by Blockchain Tech and seeing the innovation and advancement of this sector in past couple of years really motivated me to become part of this space. Since I knew basic HTML, CSS and Javascript I decided to get into this space as a developer.

Now the fun part begins! I started taking tutorials and watched videos online and learned to write simple smart contracts in solidity. I was so arrogant that I thought i would break into this space with the skill of writing a simple smart contract so i started applying like crazy (Without any portfolio to show for). I didn't get any single interview. I realized that I had to up my skill. 

After that i learned a little bit more I created 2 simple projects without frontend: A lottery Smart contract and a ToDo Smart contract and uploaded it to my recently made github profile. I remember I was so confident of getting a job after creating those 2 simple projects. I applied again like crazy and same result ! No interview.

I then decided to up my frontend skill.  I started learning React from Scrimba. After becoming comfortable creating simple frontends with react I decided to connect my smart contract projects to my frontends. Now I had 2 fully functional DApps to show for. I thought I had basic skill in Solidity, Hardhat, ethers.js and React and now I was fully confident that company would hire me for a junior developer role or for an internship. I applied, I applied and I applied but with the same result, No Interview calls! 

I now realize that even for junior roles the skill required to get into this space is much higher than what i initially thought. And now i am in a dilemma to whether continue my learning or to quit my ambition of getting hired in the space. Because even when the market was booming i didn't get a single interview and now when the market is down even the best of the best are getting unemployed. 

Currently my view of getting a job in web3 space has completely changed. At the beginning I thought it would be a piece of cake and now I think i couldn't be any further from getting a job in web3.

I would appreciate If anyone here could suggest me looking at my current skill level as mentioned above weather i have chance breaking into this space (internship or junior dev roles) with another few months of learning (what should i learn further to up my skill?) or should I leave hope getting into this space altogether.

Will Optimism have a future now that Ethereum‚Äôs roadmap is ZK centric?,"I‚Äôm not saying Optimism and optimistic tech, in general, will cease to exist, I‚Äôm just wondering how much will they be relevant the more Ethereum dives deeper into the roadmap.

Vitalik clearly stated on multiple occasions that Ethereum will be ZK-centric meaning any scaling solution that is focused solely on optimistic tech (i.e Optimism) will most likely lose a lot of daily active users.

It is even apparent by how scaling solutions are starting to focus way more on ZK tech.  
Loopring, Zksync, and Starkware are all known for ZK scaling solutions.

Polygon is also a perfect example. It has both optimistic and ZK-based scaling solutions but has recently started favoring ZK tech more and is allocating way more funds towards ZK rather than optimistic. Its to the point where they literally allocated a billion dollars just for that and already have more than 4 ZK-based scaling solutions.

I doubt that Optimism and optimistic tech will become irrelevant cause they will always be needed, however, I think influence will definitely start decreasing slowly but surely with time.

Also the most recent does not help at all (even though it is completely unrelated to the technology and more towards the security)",32.0,2022-06-13 01:37:35,0.88

stETH/ETH questions. Long winded but need to make sure my facts are straight.,"I‚Äôm not super familiar with Lido or stETH, but I‚Äôm familiar with liquid staking itself. But, let‚Äôs say Celsius has to sell its stETH, causing a further depeg from the price of ETH. That means that I could be buying future ETH at a potentially steep discount? If so, I am a patient man, and will happily due such. However, what are the risks of Lido going under do to this depeg? Seems like as long as Lido has the 1:1 ratio, then there is nothing to worry about other than the price of stETH depegging, and eventually regaining said peg, once the masses cash out their stETH for ETH. I have to be missing something right? Celsius may go under, but that‚Äôs nothing fundamental to stETH (as a network asset, just price) nor fundamental to ETH, that‚Äôs simply Celsius (and probably many more entities) over leveraging. If I‚Äôm missing something, please let me know. Otherwise I‚Äôm looking to buy some cheap ETH, I mean stETH.",47.0,2022-06-12 03:28:09,0.87
Potential crisis looming at Celsius," (From Peter Huang)  


This $3 billion crypto company was teasing that it might be valued at $10 billion this year.  


Is it headed for a huge crisis instead?  


First, some definitions:  


1. Celsius: An app where lots of people put their crypto to earn rewards  
2. Staking: Locking up some of your tokens (e.g., ETH) to help the blockchain (e.g., Ethereum) operate  
3. Liquid staking: Some party gives you another token in exchange for your staking. This token is meant to be a claim on the staked token: at some point, you can swap the liquid staking token back for your original. This lets you spend and do stuff with your staked tokens even while they're locked up.  


Users have deposited something like $3.8 billion into Celsius. We're now sort of afraid that Celsius might run into trouble.  


Celsius holds \~1 million ETH in the bank - that's \~$1.6-1.8 billion depending on the day. The problem is that only 27% is in actual ETH.  


The rest is locked up in ETH2 staking, which won't unlock for at least a year, or is stored as stETH, which is a liquid staking token.  


Remember: stETH is not ETH itself - rather, you'll be able to convert stETH to ETH whenever ETH2 staking unlocks. But it's unclear when that date is.  


People generally viewed stETH as low-risk - there's only downside if the Ethereum chain implodes entirely or never completes its transition to proof of stake and unlocks the staked tokens. Because of this, stETH has so far been valued as equal to 1 ETH.  


What's the issue? In summary, people are pulling their money out of Celsius. Latest estimate is something like 50K of ETH ($80-90 million) is leaving Celsius every week.  


There's only about 270K of actual ETH. If this continues for another \~5 weeks, Celsius has some tough choices to make.  


Oh, the other problem? Celsius took out $1 billion of loans using customers' ETH/stETH as collateral.  


If push comes to shove, Celsius will have to sell the stETH, which can cause 1 stETH to be worth less than 1 ETH if they sell enough. Depending on how far the price of stETH falls, this could cause their loans to get liquidated.  


(Worth mentioning: there are other big players who hold lots of stETH. If they dump their stETH, that could cause Celsius loans to be in trouble, too.)  


I doubt Celsius will just watch all this happen. They will probably just disable withdrawals when it gets risky. But never good to have big problems looming.  


This is just the latest in ""safe"" tokens being challenged post-UST/LUNA. USDT was under threat as people started to pull money out of crypto.  


Now stETH, which was viewed as generally safe (""It's all tied to securing Ethereum, and Ethereum isn't going away!"") and probably will be just fine given enough time, is starting to drop in price.  


The problem is that players like Celsius are going to get caught in the window when it's not fine at all.

Optimism hacker appears and says he could return the stolen goods.,"The person who stole 20 million units of the optimism (OP) token broke his silence. Hours ago, he sent a transaction to Ethereum co-creator Vitalik Buterin, along with a message in which he assures that he will return much of what he stole.

""Hi Vitalik, I believe in you, I just want to know your opinion on this. By the way, help me verify the sender's address and I'll return the rest,"" the message reads. It adds, ""Hi Wintermute, sorry, I only have 18 million [tokens] and this is what I can return. stay optimistic!"".

Apparently, part of the funds if will stay in various DeFi protocols and other blockchain projects, especially the large part that according to the investigation has been used to invest in Ownex, Minosis Token and LunaFi.

The theft had occurred before the airdrop that benefited users of Ethereum's second layer, Optimism. The attacker took advantage of a vulnerability in the decentralized finance platform (DeFi) Wintermute to take the tokens, valued at nearly USD 17 million.

The fact that the event had been kept secret for several days caused unease among many users of this scalability solution, as they considered it a lack of transparency on the part of the organization.

Now, with the promise to return a large part of the stolen tokens, the market has reacted. On price tracking portals such as CoinMarketCap it can be seen that OP's price increased slightly in the last hours, just when the hacker broke the silence.

Now, we will have to wait if Buterin gives any response to his message and if, indeed, the attacker keeps his promise.",163.0,2022-06-11 09:31:53,0.85

How to attend Ethereum Conferences for Free,"I spent a week in Miami for a multi-chain crypto conference and my flight, hotel and food cost me $0. I even made some money while doing this. The really crazy part? 2 months ago I didn‚Äôt even know such a thing was possible.

I recently learned about a thing called crypto scholarships and crypto hackathons and hundreds of people having been using them as a great ways to travel the world for free, meet cool people, build cool stuff, make some money and learn new skills. Today, I will show you how to do the same.

## How I Learned About This

I first learned about this when I went to the Ethereum conference in Amsterdam, [ETHAmsterdam](https://amsterdam.ethglobal.com/), I met a cool group of women from an Organization called  Blu3 DAO.

Me: ‚ÄúAmsterdam is fun but so expensive, I don‚Äôt think I don‚Äôt know when I can afford this again.‚Äù

Them: ‚ÄúO, we don‚Äôt pay for trips. We‚Äôve been to Barcelona, Amsterdam, Denver. Flights, hotel, food. Everything paid for.‚Äù

I was intrigued.

Someone else told me in passing that they had about a couple days left of cash before they had to head back home but they were planning on winning 1 or 2 hackathon prizes so they could stay in Europe longer.

I was intrigued again.

Intrigued by all these things I was hearing, I decided to delve deeper and do some research, here‚Äôs my guide to how to travel the world for free with crypto scholarships.

## How it Works

So what‚Äôs the catch? Even as I‚Äôm writing this, It‚Äôs pretty incredible that these things even exist. You literally travel the world for free, go to cool events and parties, do some work and get paid. The reason this exists (the catch) is that a lot of crypto companies, blockchains, tools need to grow and they have money to spend. So a common growth strategy is offering scholarships for people who use their platforms. You also don‚Äôt need to code to qualify, as I‚Äôll explain later.

## Join Crypto and Web3 Communities

The best way to start finding these opportunities is by being aware of the different communities that exist in the crypto and web3 space.

## Get Twitter, Discord and Telegram accounts

Most of these communities exist virtually on Twitter, Discord and Telegram. So in order to get involved and be aware of what‚Äôs out there, you‚Äôll need to make an account on those 3 platforms.

Crypto is a fast-moving space and most of the information is shared on Twitter and semi-public channels on Discord and Telegram so if you want to be aware of those opportunities you need to be plugged into those channels.

1. Twitter
2. Discord
3. Telegram

## Join a DAO

Next, find a bunch of  [DAOs](https://ethereum.org/en/dao/)  and join them. A DAO is basically just a fancy word for a club or a group of people that are connected in some way.

Here‚Äôs a list of DAOs you can join to start your search.

1. [Developer DAO](https://twitter.com/developer_dao)
2. [PadawanDAO](https://twitter.com/padawandao)
3. [Blu3 DAO](https://twitter.com/blu3dao)
4. [Atilatech](https://twitter.com/atilatech?lang=en)
5. [Her DAO](https://twitter.com/_herdao?lang=en)
6. [BoysClub](https://mobile.twitter.com/boysclubcrypto)
7. [Women Build Web3](https://twitter.com/womenbuildweb3)
8. [Women in Web3](https://twitter.com/womeninweb3)
9. [BanklessDAO](https://twitter.com/banklessdao?lang=en)

From my research, most of the scholarship and grant opportuntiies are focused on getting more women and non-binary folx into web3. This is great news because if you‚Äôre woman or non-binary person reading this, it means there‚Äôs lots of scholarships available for you. It also means that tese events are not all ‚Äúcrypto bros‚Äù.

Also, even if you‚Äôre a man you can still get some of these grants. For example, one of the scholarships I received was by a women and non-binary group and marketed mostly toawards women, however, they reserved 10% of the total scholarship pools for men to join as allies. Many people might have missed that fine print but you should always look carefully at the fine print. I think many of the other women-focused DAOs do the same.

## Follow the DAO‚Äôs Socials

First, thing you should do is follow the DAO on Twitter, then follow their Discord and Telegram pages. Different DAOs have different messaging norms. Most accounts have a Twitter presence, but will post the real-time information on Discord or Telegram.

There‚Äôs a lot of information asymmetry in web3, let me explain:

Remember that meme about how Twitter gets all the jokes first and then people on Instagram find out about it? Well usually some news will be shared on Discord or Telegram first (‚Äúalpha‚Äù in crypto twitter Lingo), then it will get to Twitter and sometimes depending on the nature of the information, by the time it gets to Twitter, it‚Äôs already too late.

You might find that even more information is being shared in an invite-only chat on Telegram and all you have to do to join is ask!. This is just like school study groups. There‚Äôs usually a group chat where a lot of useful information is being shared so make sure you ask around so you can find it and join.

## Follow People in Web3

In addition to following organizations you should also follow individuals since they‚Äôll post a lot of information as well that span across different organizations. I recommend the following accounts:

1. [Mabel.Tech](https://twitter.com/mabelochebiri)
2. [GigaHierz](https://mobile.twitter.com/gigahierz)
3. [Steph (Oceans 404)](https://twitter.com/0ceans404)
4. [Novell](https://twitter.com/novellsk8)
5. [Dabit3](https://twitter.com/dabit3)
6. [Maia Zennie](https://twitter.com/maiazennie)
7. [Daphne](https://twitter.com/daphachar)
8. [Seemcat](https://twitter.com/seemcat)

## Find Scholarships

Once you‚Äôve joined or followed these DAOs you can start looking for scholarships.

1. Social Media Search (Twitter, Telegram, Discord)
2. Atlas Search
3. Asking organizations to create scholarships
4. Google Search

## Social Media Search

Most of the information about scholarships are on social media websites and semi-public channels like Telegram and Discord, but it can be very hard to keep up with the large amounts of volume generated by these platforms. So a very underrated tool is just using the search features.

For Twitter search you can usually search for ‚Äú\[event\_you\_want\_to\_attend\] scholarship‚Äù or ‚Äú\[dao\_name\]‚Äù scholarship. Here are some examples:

* ‚Äú[Blu3DAO scholarship](https://twitter.com/search?q=blu3dao%20scholarship&src=typed_query&f=top)‚Äù
* ‚Äú[ETHCC Grants](https://twitter.com/search?q=EthCC%20%20grants&src=typed_query&f=top)‚Äù

For Discord and Telegram, go to each DAO that you‚Äôve joined and just search for the word scholarship or grant.

&#x200B;

## Atlas Search

Another method is using a dedicated crypto search engine like  [Atlas](https://atlas.atila.ca/)  ([broswer extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/atila-atlas/lhjdnmdnomdgjkbefpnehflckklipbak)). If you search Atlas for the word, ‚Äúscholarship‚Äù or ‚Äúgrants‚Äù all the crypto and web3 pages that are related to scholarships will be available.  


Note: I made Atlas and Atila

## Asking organizations to create scholarships

A very underrated way of finding scholarships, which  [I‚Äôve recommended before](https://atila.ca/blog/tomiwa/atila-scholarship-guide#bonus-asking-for-scholarships-that-dont-exist)  is straight up asking people to create scholarships or grants programs. Suppose you want to attend ETHCC and you see a bunch of organizations are attending but not offering scholarships, you can just ask them to create one and give a compelling reason for what they could gain from doing a scholarship.

You can  [use this template when emailing or DMing organizations to start a scholarship ir grant](https://atila.ca/blog/tomiwa/atila-scholarship-guide#sample-email-or-phone-script).

&#x200B;

## Google Search

Sometimes things are so obvious you overlook them. A great example of this is using Google to find crypto scholarships. A simple Google search for words like ‚Äú[crypto hackathon scholarships](https://www.google.com/search?q=crypto+hackathon+scholarships)‚Äù or ‚Äú[crypto ecosystem grants](https://www.google.com/search?q=crypto+ecosystem+grants)‚Äù can deliver some great results.

Google is  [not](https://future.a16z.com/the-future-of-search-is-boutique/)  [very](https://medium.com/bankless-dao/how-web3-writers-do-research-719cb9857eb#:~:text=Google%20doesn%E2%80%99t%20like%20our%20Web3%20content%20(yet)%2C%20but%20sometimes%20it%20pulls%20right%20up.)

For example, many grants and scholarships are in Google Forms, Typeform or Notion. Pages won‚Äôt show up on a Google Search, so for those you will likely need to use a tool like  [Atlas](https://atlas.atila.ca/)  to find them.

## Apply for Scholarship

Once you‚Äôve actually found some scholarships and grants, you‚Äôll need to write an application. I wrote a  [guide on how to write a good scholarship or grant application](https://atila.ca/blog/tomiwa/atila-scholarship-application-guide/). Here are some more tips that are specific to scholarships for crypto-related events:

## Writing a Good Application

When you‚Äôre applying for a scholarship they generally want to see that you can contribute to their ecosystem. This can be reflected in a variet of ways.

1. Coding experience to build cools apps on their platform
2. Social media following to prompt their platform
3. Previous example of taking initiative

While 1 and 2 may require you to know how to code or have a large following on social media. Which not everyone might have. Literally, anyone can qualify for number 3. All it means is that you need to have some way to prove that if you were given the scholarship, you can give value back to the people providing the scholarship.

I asked Daphne, ‚Äúwhat do you look for in a scholarship applicant‚Äù, she gave great answer.

Summary:

* Priority for software developers (you don‚Äôt need web3/crypto experience!)
   * but also open to people from a wide range of backgrounds (artists, lawyers, teachers etc.)
* They prioritize inclusivity so they try to get people from a wide range of backgrounds
* Effort in your answers. They look at how much thought and effort you put into the long answer questions

## Engaging on Social Media

By now it should be clear to you how important social media is in the crypto and web3 space. Another, great way to stand out to the scholarship and grant reviewers is by engaging with them on social media. For example, see  [what my friend Maia did to get a ticket to ETHCC in Paris](https://twitter.com/maiazennie/status/1531092690330193922).

## Fulfilling the Scholarship Requirements

In the spirit of transparency, I actually got one of my scholarships taken away because they felt like I didn‚Äôt fulfill the scholarship requirements. Learn from my experience, know that this is a thing that can be happen and make sure you‚Äôre very clear on what the expectations of the scholarship are.

## Many Grants are Reimbursed but Arrangments Can be Made

Some of these scholarships require yu to buy the ticket first and then they pay you back. This helps situations which have happened to many DAOs where people take the money and don‚Äôt show up. Depending on your financial situation, this might not be feasible for you to pay even if you‚Äôre going to get reimbursed. I‚Äôd encourage you to message them and they can usually work something out.

## Crypto Hackathons

The other thing you should do is apply for crypto hackathons. In addition to getting your trip paid for, you can also often get paid thousands of dollars for building a crypto-related project in a weekend. You also don‚Äôt need to know how to code to apply. As long as you can add value in another way (project management, slides, presentation, design etc.) find someone who can code and join their team. Also, at some hackathons you may not even need to code, I‚Äôve been at a hackathon where one of the winners presented a Figma template. It‚Äôs pretty remarkable that for a lot of these hackathons you can do anywhere from 6-36 hours worth of work and win around $2-5,000.

Here‚Äôs a list of websites that offer hackathons:

1. [Devpost](https://devpost.com/hackathons)
2. [MLH.io](https://mlh.io/)
3. [DoraHacks](https://dorahacks.io/)
4. [Crypto Events 2022 \[by CNC\]](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1KtyFTb_W282bQ1xoVA5rlTwTDz3QfhswWIVpXhpbQIc/edit)
5. [EthGlobal](https://ethglobal.com/)
   1. [In my experience](https://atila.ca/blog/tomiwa/ethamsterdam-2022-notes-building-the-future-with-crypto/#ethglobal-knows-how-to-run-a-good-event), ETHGlobal, consistently has the best hackathons. So if you can‚Äôt make it to all of these, try to make it to at least the ETHGlobal events.

## Thank You

I want to thank the following organizations for paying for my trip expenses, giving me hackathon prizes and creating this amazing opportunity for thousands of people all over the world to discover web3.

## Conclusion

Crypto scholarships and hackathons are a great way to travel the world, meet cool people, make some money and learn something new. It‚Äôs pretty amazing that such opportunities like this exist and many people don‚Äôt know about it. So now that you know about it, make the most of it.",147.0,2022-06-10 10:57:53,0.85
ENS domains - What I have learned so far and projection of the possible future," Ethereum will probably be the 1. most used crypto in the future because it has a broad application, currently, about 4 million people use it but I see that number rising exponentially in coming years with crypto integration so hundreds of millions of people could potentially start to use it. 

Using a long 0x.... address will be complicated so everybody would probably want to buy ENS for themselves to simplify the transactions and to brand it because it is cool. There are only 2889 combinations of 3 number ENS and about 3276 3 letters combination in the English alphabet. I think they are really underpriced right now and there would be at least 6000 multimillionaires who would like to flex and to have them so their price might be hundred of thousands if not millions of dollars soon.  Anthony Hopkins just today bought an ENS and I think we will see that more and more in the following months.

There is also the real possibility of all Web3 things being linked to your .eth, so your wallet address, e-mail, website, maybe even real-life ownership of the real estate and such, lot of possibilities.

So buying the .eth ENS now will put you in a great place when that happens. Everybody will want to buy a personal .eth and by almost all meaningful being bought they will need to buy it from people who own them. I suggest everybody buy at least 10-20 which have a meaning and hold until that happens. That will be a 10-100x investment in 1-2 years easily.

There are a lot of great ones that have a good meaning and are not yet bought, you just need to be a bit creative. Also, there are a lot of companies and influential and wealthy people whose real names have not been bought yet.

A good tool to use when doing research is ens tools and ens vision. For you to buy your first domain you just go to ens dot domains and check if it is free. If yes you connect your metamask wallet and buy it, when gas is low 5+ letters can be bought for \~18$. It is automatically listed under your profile on opensea and you can list it for sale or connect it with your wallet address so people can use your newly bought ENS for sending you ETH.  
 

These are some of the domains I have bought, maybe they can give you some inspiration for your future purchases.

The ApeCoin DAO proposal officially leans towards keeping the community within the Ethereum network.,"ApeCoin DAO, a governance system serving the democratic rights of holders of ApeCoin - a digital asset linked to the Bored Ape Yacht Club collection ecosystem - released an official proposal on May 2 to discuss whether the asset should remain on the Ethereum network, transition to a Layer 2 alternative or perhaps explore the possibility of switching chains.

The ApeCoin Improvement Proposal (AIP) titled ""AIP-41: Keep ApeCoin within the Ethereum Ecosystem,"" was drafted by BAYC 2491, known as ASEC, and was inspired by a number of incidents, including Otherdeed's controversial minting of NFTs, and the subsequent backlash from Yuga Labs.

For the counter proposal inspired by previous incidents, controversies and more recent decentralization or DeFi projects such as Ownex, Minosis Token or LunaFi, was put on the table as a possible solution.

However, After a six-day voting period, the final results convincingly reveal that 67.77% of ApeCoin users advocate staying on Ethereum for the medium-term future, with 4 million APE tokens used in votes.

The calamitous auction of Yuga Labs' Otherdeeds metaverse lands intensely scrutinized the financial limitations of Ethereum's gas-rate mechanics, and led key members of the ApeCoin community to voice their concerns around ApeCoin's fixed supply contract, and its potential for scalability.

The overwhelming deflation of the gas wars, and the lack of financial inclusion or integrity, was then compounded by Yuga Labs' ill-timed tweet insisting that ""it seems pretty clear that ApeCoin will need to migrate to its own blockchain in order to scale properly,"" and that ""we would encourage the DAO to start thinking in this direction.""

Despite Yuga Labs' not at all subtle suggestion, AIP-41 passionately advocated against Ethereum migration, stating that ""such a decision is currently too complex and costly to make,"" and could potentially damage its entrenched network presence with the highest volume and cultural adoption of NFT.

The outcome of the vote on the ApeCoin DAO proposal will not be final and may be deliberated and rebutted with a secondary vote within a three-month grace period.

The total vote on the proposal was 2.7 million in favor and 1.3 million against, which is 67.77%. This result is not entirely final, and may be further deliberated with the submission of new proposals within the aforementioned three-month grace period.",96.0,2022-06-09 16:24:09,0.94

OpenSea Ethereum Transaction Volume Decreased by 25%: Could There Be A Less Interest In NFTs Already?,"Since August of last year, OpenSea has been routinely producing billions of dollars‚Äô worth of transaction volume each month, making it the most successful marketplace in the whole NFT industry ahead of BinanceNFT, SolSea and new marketplaces like LooksRare and Solis. 

 However, the transaction volume of OpenSea based on Ethereum in May was $2.596 billion, which is a decline of roughly 25% from April‚Äôs value, and the number of monthly active users was 422,300, which is a drop of around 11% from April‚Äôs flow rate.  According to Dune, OpenSea clasped a decreasing trend in transaction volume by recording a 40% percent month-over-month rise in trading volume in April. During the same month, approximately $3.5 billion worth of Ethereum NFT deals were completed.  

The non-fungible token market as a whole is moving away from the way in which it was historically controlled by Ethereum. Traders are now more equally distributed across many alternative-chain markets, and the average number of user transactions is growing while costs are decreasing.  In addition, the data from DappRadar reveals that Magic Eden has executed NFT transactions at a far greater pace than OpenSea. Despite this, the marketplace situated in Solana has reported lower sales metrics owing to the scarcity of blue-chip NFTs.  What move could help revive the downtrend?",127.0,2022-06-06 20:46:37,0.9

Ethereum gave birth to multi-purpose chains meaning the vast majority of crypto projects owe homage to Ethereum,"Technically speaking, Bitcoin started it all. But the innovation in smart contracts and dApps all started with Ethereum.

All your favorite platforms, dApps, and NFT games owe homage to Ethereum.  
Without Ethereum, most of the market would simply have blockchains like Bitcoin designed around one application that has the sole purpose of keeping track of digital money.

All chains that are competing against Ethereum right now got inspired by Ethereum in the first place. In fact, some of the most popular competitors have either founders or developers that were once building on Ethereum and decided to branch out and do their own thing.

And yeah Ethereum isn‚Äôt without its flaws. It is notorious for its high gas fees and overall scalability issues. But this is slowly becoming less and less of a problem seeing how fast scaling solutions have been developing new tech, especially in the ZK space with projects like Loopring and Zksync.  
Polygon alone allocated a billion dollars solely for ZK tech development and currently has 4 ZK scaling solutions.

So in brief, if you have a crypto project that you love religiously, 99% of the time it is a project forked from, built on top of, or inspired by Ethereum. Never forget that.",57.0,2022-06-03 15:29:14,0.79
I love seeing Optimism doing its thing. But I think ZK tech will eventually win over Optimistic tech,"And when I say ‚ÄúZK tech will win‚Äù this doesn‚Äôt mean that Optimistic tech will disappear completely.  
Optimistic tech will always be needed for specific situations and it will always have users that prefer it.

What I mean by this is that Ethereum will end up being ZK centric for a multitude of reasons. Vitalik himself said this once on the Bankless podcast.

ZK is simply faster and cheaper than optimistic tech and most importantly, its a lot more private which is an added benefit for a blockchain known for its decentralization.

If anything, you can already start seeing tell tale signs of how the ecosystem is shifting towards ZK centric L2s just by looking at the funds being granted for development.  
ZK based L2s have been getting A LOT more funding than optimistic based L2s plus they‚Äôre getting more partnerships as well.  
Loopring‚Äôs famous partnership with GameStop is one example you‚Äôd think of instantly.  
Another example would be ETH giants like BitDAO granting Zksync $200 million for the development of ZkDAO (apparently a scaling solution solely for DAOs).  
And this is not to mention the tons of funds getting poured into ZK tech all over the Ethereum ecosystem.

Now compare these numbers and data with the ones being allocated for optimistic based L2s and you‚Äôll know exactly what I mean.  
Ethereum is slowly but surely heading towards ZK integration. That is a fact.",89.0,2022-06-03 15:17:52,0.93
Are GPUs becoming more affordable due to Ethereum's upcoming merge?,"GPUs or Graphics Processing Units, which are mainly used to mine ethereum, are becoming less expensive. This is possible because the network plans to convert from a proof-of-work or PoW model to a proof-of-stake or PoS one.

 And rendering these computer parts completely worthless for all those mining ethereum.


Leveraging information from Tom's Hardware, CoinDesk found that the valuation for top GPU units on eBay had plummeted by 37 percent since May 2021, when Chinese officials announced a further ban on cryptocurrency mining in the nation.


However, the price decline has increased this year. Ethereum developers explore the PoS approach and the value of the second-largest cryptocurrency plummets.


On the online platform, the value of ten key GPU models fell by 7.4 percent in January, 9.5 percent in February, and 12 percent in March. According to Tristan Gerra, executive director and lead analyst for semiconductors at investment group Robert W. Baird, cryptocurrency mining accounts for around 35 percent of worldwide customer needs for GPUs. GPU miners ""are not truly investing in new hardware at the present time, since valuations have been significant for a while."" This was basically said by Joe Downie, chief marketing manager at hash power broker NiceHash. Instead, ""most of them are probably trying for when Ethereum shifts to PoS, to snap up the secondhand GPUs"" from people who will actually give up when the switch happens. Currently ETH moves closer to its new ecosystem, many Web 3.0 projects like Polygon, faith tribe, Tron and Theta will benefit as the web 3.0 ecosystem as whole will become more cost efficient. 


According to Haohao, a marketing representative from Xuxin Science and Technology, a firm that resells mining rigs in China, the situation in Ukraine reduced cryptocurrency prices in February. This condition makes mine less viable, and so GPU values fell even further.

 According to Haohao, approximately 20 percent to 30 percent of cryptocurrency mining hardware in China has been basically sold since the shutdown.",78.0,2022-06-01 18:18:36,0.8

I feel like Ethereum‚Äôs scalability issue is becoming less and less relevant with the fast development of L2s,"I might be biased cause I‚Äôve been part of the Ethereum community since 2018, but I genuinely think that Ethereum is the best chain out there right now. However, the only issue with it has always been traffic and gas fees.

Ethereum has always been plagued with this issue but I‚Äôm starting to feel like it's slowly but surely becoming less and less of a problem with how fast L2s have been developing their tech.

Ethereum is taking a rollup-centric roadmap right now (specifically ZK rollups) and it will eventually integrate L2s into the blockchain in a way that makes them nearly inseparable from Ethereum. Vitalik talked a lot about it and he basically dreams of an Etherum where L2s aren't considered as an add-on anymore but more of a part of Ethereum that will end up being taken for granted with no second thought about them. We‚Äôre already seeing a ton of exciting Zk development from multiple projects on the market most notably Polygon which I think takes the cake with 4 ZK scaling solutions ready for use (Hermez, Miden, Zero, and Nightfall) and $1 billion allocated for ZK tech development.

All of this effort and funds combined will end up making Ethereum problem less and less relevant, especially after the introduction of sharding which will basically put L2s on steroids.",507.0,2022-05-31 09:53:11,0.91

**Frequently Asked Questions**

**Where's the best place to buy ETH?**

There are many centralized exchanges that support Ethereum. If you live in the US, the most popular exchanges are Coinbase, Gemeni and Kraken. Coinbase users can use Coinbase Pro for lower fees.

**When is Eth2 launching?**

Eth2 is a marketing term used to represent a number of updates to Ethereum. The Eth2 proof-of-stake chain first launched in December 2020. ""The Merge"", which is the event that will fully switch Ethereum's consensus to proof-of-stake, is estimated to be ready in early 2022, although there is no exact timeline. Other updates, such as data shards, will follow that update.

Visit [ethmerge.com](https://ethmerge.com/) to learn more about ""The Merge"".

**Do I need to do anything to update to Eth2? Will Eth2 create a new token?**

No, ETH holders *never* need to take any action to keep holding ETH. Ethereum users will be unaffected by the Eth2 upgrade. And the Eth2 updates will not create any new tokens.

**How can I stake my ETH?**

The best way to stake your ETH: by running your own validator.

* Running your own validator requires a modern computer and 32 ETH. Visit /r/ethstaker for more details

**Why are Ethereum transaction fees so high?**

Like most blockchains, Ethereum fees are determined by supply-and-demand. The large demand to use Ethereum has pushed transaction fees quite high (however, fees were just a few cents only 2 years ago). Fees are especially high during market volatility, and during NFT drops.

**What is being done to lower Ethereum transaction fees?**

Ethereum fees are reduced by using layer-2 rollups. Rollups are scaling solutions that allow for significantly cheaper transactions, while still maintaining Ethereum's security.

Additionally, Eth2's data shards will make rollups even cheaper.

While rollups are cutting-edge technology being actively developed, a number are already live on Ethereum mainnet. Visit [l2beat.com](https://l2beat.com/) to learn more about rollups.

**What's the best wallet for Ethereum?**

The most popular tool for using decentralized applications is Metamask. However, for security reasons, we recommend using a hardware wallet such as a Trezor or Ledger.

"DeFi is either truly immutable or permissionless, or it is only ""automated finance"".","The TLDR is that behind the scenes the US and EU want global mandatory travel rule, which means KYC, compliance, on every DeFi smart contract, every software wallet, and eventually trezor and nano. This is their starting point, because they basically run the world and want a ""suprastate"" more or less.

They're just going to legally intimidate, enforce, coerce, extradite, prosecute etc developers until they bleed us dry and fully intimidate any venture capital. VC can't do anything, all major liquidity providers will always be extremely legally exposed.

We need to look at a few facts here:

1) Web 3 helps people in failed states more than developed nations. If a government is particularly terrible and undemocratic, Web 3 being fully immutable and fully anonymous is an absolute necessity.

2) Canada proved that allegedly democratic states will fascistically confiscate funds and politically persecute you for speech and assembly. 

3) america has done this in the past, to countless people, notably the Internment of Japanese citizens. america has reneged on countless treaties.

4) Most developing nations are in fact colonially designed ""Post-Colonial administrative States"" that are designed to largely enrich international companies at the expense of civil liberties for the developing world. 

5) ""activist"" regularly collude with and weaponize the Privitization of Multinational capital institutions to advocate censorship and confiscation of funds, deplatforming of rights to a living, ""activist"" regularly collude with executive branches of states simultaneously to do extrajudicial, unelected confiscatory and censorial behavior against their political enemies

5b) this sets the precedent to do the same behavior to other outgroups in developing nations, it serves as a playbook for what undemocratic countries can do, and furthers the extreme fascistic behavior of Web2 companies, who also operate overseas in developing nations. It's also already happened in numerous egregious instances I won't get into.

6) Banks and Web2 were used extensively from 2001-to late 2017 and current to further the war on terror, the continued prejudice exists to this day with Persians being blackballed from most of the entire crypto industry, even blackballed from Github.

7) China's entire political system is utterly anti-thetical to crypto, the CCP largely has no use for blockchain technology. The type of human control they want is much easier with SQL databases.

7b) China locked people in their apartments for 60 days, so yes you basically belong to the state there, good luck with speech or finance. 

8) People in extremely poor developing nations have absolutely no documentation or their documentation is extremely limited, banking is non existent. If they are given permissioned back doored narc ware automated crypto-finance, their own government will use it to prejudice them deeply, and that's not even getting into what we already do to say Iran as I already mentioned.

9) Web 1 is not state resistant. Self hosting is not state or sovereign resistant. Tor is not enough. Web 1 is not ""neutral territory"",  in that individual websites can easily be targeted, you do not have a ""platform network commons of neutrality"" to give some sort of ""lost in the crowd effect"" to protect you from political persecution. 

9b) Though the absolute blockchainifcation of everything is stupid, and excess tokens are stupid, Web 1 basically has no state resistance to corrupt or ideological factions of the state, or states, without some finality, fidelity, and encryption via Zkrollups and layer 3 features and or Lightning, or IBC, etc. offchain engineering without onchain guarantees makes web 1 deeply vulnerable and deeply unscalable. This is why Web2 beat Web 1's network effect so severely, scale and adoption based on peer to peer usage.  

10) Currency Boards, Central Banks, and Lebanon as example. Need I say more.

11) and this is important, Daos that we have, have made, or have tried to make are by definition much more democratic and transparent than Western Governments. Whatever international consensus you think is needed to public infrastructure, taxation, charity, children, the elderly, whatever concern you have about oversight of ""criminals"", public networks like ethereum, and public protocols like aave are infinitely more democratic than the US government, SEC, or countless evil web 2 companies like Reddit.",28.0,2022-05-28 17:09:52,0.77

L2s are a great medicine for scalability but they aren‚Äôt the cure,"Now I have to clarify that Vitalik‚Äôs vision is for L2s to become so incredibly efficient that the difference between medicine and cure doesn‚Äôt even matter anymore. He wants L2s to basically become an integral part of Ethereum‚Äôs chain.

But for the meantime, my title stays true to its word. L2s are more of a very effective band aid that constantly need change from time to time.

And that‚Äôs okay as long as L2s keep up this current pace of development.  
Some find it toxic, but I think the rivalry between L2s is exactly what‚Äôs keeping Ethereum alive right now cause each L2 is trying to 1up the other.  
Polygon and Loopring are both at each other‚Äôs neck and have both come up with some great tech as a result of that. We‚Äôve also saw some aggressive development from Zksync resulting in impressive scalability number which landed them lots of funds from bitdao for ZkDAO‚Äôs development.

Ethereum Beacon Chain experiences 7 block reorg: What‚Äôs going on?,"""This reorg is not an indicator of a flawed fork choice, but a non-trivial segmentation of updated vs out of date client software,"" said Preston Van Loon, a Core Ethereum developer.

On Wednesday, Ethereum's Beacon Chain underwent a seven-block reorganization, or reorg, ahead of the Merge, which is tentatively scheduled for August. 

According to Beacon Scan data, seven blocks from 3,887,075 to 3,887,081 were removed from the Beacon Chain on Wednesday between 08:55:23 and 08:56:35 am UTC. Ethereum is a transaction network similar to Tron and Concordium which is much faster than the Solana network.

The term ""reorg"" refers to an event in which a canonical chain block, such as the Beacon Chain, is knocked off the chain due to a competing block beating it out.

It could be the result of a malicious attack by a resourceful miner or a bug. In such cases, the chain may unintentionally fork or duplicate. 

On this occasion, developers believe that the problem is a result of circumstance rather than a serious flaw such as a security flaw or fundamental flaw, with a ""proposer boost fork"" being highlighted in particular. This is a method of selecting the next block in the blockchain in which specific proposers are given priority.

Core According to Ethereum developer Preston Van Loon, the reorg was caused by a ""non-trivial segmentation"" of new and old client node software and was not necessarily malicious. Vitalik Buterin, co-founder of Ethereum, called the theory a ""good hypothesis."" 
On Wednesday morning, Martin K√∂ppelmann, co-founder of the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)-compatible Gnosis chain, was among the first to highlight the occurrence via Twitter, noting that it ""shows that the current attestation strategy of nodes should be reconsidered to hopefully result in a more stable chain! (proposals already exist)."" 

Van Loon tentatively attributed the reorg to the proposer boost fork, which had not yet been fully implemented, in response to K√∂ppelmann:

‚ÄúWe suspect this is caused by the implementation of Proposer Boost fork choice has not fully rolled out to the network. This reorg is not an indicator of a flawed fork choice, but a non-trivial segmentation of updated vs out of date client software.‚Äù

‚ÄúAll of the details will be made public once we have a high degree of confidence regarding the root cause. Expect a post-mortem from the client development community!‚Äù he added.

Terence Tsao, another developer, echoed this hypothesis to his 11,900 Twitter followers earlier on Thursday, noting that the reorg appeared to be caused by ""boosted vs. non-boosted nodes in the network and the timing of a really late arriving block:"" 

""Given that the proposer boost is a non-binding change. Because of the asymmetry in the client release schedule, the roll-out occurred gradually. ""Not all nodes updated the proposer boost at the same time.""

Van Loon stated last week at the Permissionless conference that the Merge and switch to proof-of-stake (PoS) could happen in August ""if everything goes as planned.""

I have found this [article](https://elearningindustry.com/impact-of-blockchain-technology-on-the-elearning-industry) about the impact of blockchain on Elearning If you think about it, it will be a win-win situation and it will also be helpful for those who don‚Äôt have the motivation to learn. Not just by learning about coins like Coinbase where you can start learning by watching videos and answering quiz questions that run for a certain period of time, Binance where a new user who signed up within 3 days can earn popular coins, Coinmarketcap partners with a variety of new cryptocurrencies and protocols trying to get their name out there, but like Kirin metaverse where they will have games that offer programs that reinforce education and reward learning with crypto assets, and I‚Äôm not sure if you will earn something from Bloktopia but it will act as a gateway for users to learn about blockchain and how it's helping power the metaverse.

**Frequently Asked Questions**

**Where's the best place to buy ETH?**

There are many centralized exchanges that support Ethereum. If you live in the US, the most popular exchanges are Coinbase, Gemeni and Kraken. Coinbase users can use Coinbase Pro for lower fees.

**When is Eth2 launching?**

Eth2 is a marketing term used to represent a number of updates to Ethereum. The Eth2 proof-of-stake chain first launched in December 2020. ""The Merge"", which is the event that will fully switch Ethereum's consensus to proof-of-stake, is estimated to be ready in early 2022, although there is no exact timeline. Other updates, such as data shards, will follow that update.

Visit [ethmerge.com](https://ethmerge.com/) to learn more about ""The Merge"".

**Do I need to do anything to update to Eth2? Will Eth2 create a new token?**

No, ETH holders *never* need to take any action to keep holding ETH. Ethereum users will be unaffected by the Eth2 upgrade. And the Eth2 updates will not create any new tokens.

**How can I stake my ETH?**

The best way to stake your ETH: by running your own validator.

* Running your own validator requires a modern computer and 32 ETH. Visit /r/ethstaker for more details

**Why are Ethereum transaction fees so high?**

Like most blockchains, Ethereum fees are determined by supply-and-demand. The large demand to use Ethereum has pushed transaction fees quite high (however, fees were just a few cents only 2 years ago). Fees are especially high during market volatility, and during NFT drops.

**What is being done to lower Ethereum transaction fees?**

Ethereum fees are reduced by using layer-2 rollups. Rollups are scaling solutions that allow for significantly cheaper transactions, while still maintaining Ethereum's security.

Additionally, Eth2's data shards will make rollups even cheaper.

While rollups are cutting-edge technology being actively developed, a number are already live on Ethereum mainnet. Visit [l2beat.com](https://l2beat.com/) to learn more about rollups.

**What's the best wallet for Ethereum?**

The most popular tool for using decentralized applications is Metamask. However, for security reasons, we recommend using a hardware wallet such as a Trezor or Ledger.

Did the LUNA crash reveal an inherent risk in Proof Of Stake networks?,"Most stories that you will read about the event will focus on the depegging of the mechanism of the algorithmic stablecoin which was tied to the supply and market value of the protocol token. This is interesting, of course, but I don't see too many people discussing the other side effect, the network became so vulnerable to attacks at the consensus level that the Luna Foundation was forced to turn it off. \[[https://twitter.com/terra\_money/status/1524935730308456448](https://twitter.com/terra_money/status/1524935730308456448)\] Because the proof of stake network derived the security guarantees from the (Dollar) cost of staked Luna, its market price devaluation allowed malicious actors to buy Luna for cheap and attack the network at the consensus level. 

I must confess that I was aware of the concerns for the mechanism design of Luna, and knew there was a risk for a death spiral. However, I did not think the risks would play out so spectacularly and meteorically. I also assumed that in normal market conditions, the decisions of the Luna Foundation Guard (LFG) to use BTC as their forex reserve would allow the foundation to counteract the risks. It was a declaration of defeat of the algorithmic stable coin system, but I thought it would generally be able to recover from volatile - and natural market conditions. That is because I did not consider the coordinated malicious attack security vector. The fact that the attackers were able to short the market made it profitable to crash the market price of Luna, made me revisit previous assumptions I've had and am less confident in POS as a concept.

Once the price of Luna crashed the chain became vulnerable for a consensus level attack, which is why it was 'shut down'. This is often overlooked, but I find it to be the most significant revelation about the entire ordeal. To me this seems to indicate there is a systemic risk for a death spiral on EVERY proof of stake network. Yes, even Ethereum, the network that I use daily, and that I chose as the most secure infrastructure to build the platform that I am working on. The core concept of Proof Of Stake is that it is expensive to be a malicious actor. But the expense to attack a proof of stake network is not denominated in value exogenous to the network itself. You stake Ether to secure Ethereum, and thus make the Ether that you need to run computation on that network more valuable. That means that **if the value of Ether goes down, the security of the Ethereum network goes down**. There is a point in which you can effectively use market mechanics to bring the value of Ethtereum low enough to make an attack on the network‚Äôs consensus viable, at which point the value of Ether would continue to fall in the same kind of feedback loop that we saw with Luna. Impractical, yes, unrealistic, I don't think so. **The network is valuable because it is expensive to attack it, and it‚Äôs expensive to attack it because the unit price of Ether is valuable.** This logic is a bit more circular than I am comfortable with. 

Have people addressed this risk in PoS chains directly? I am not too interested in discussing the LUNA thing further, but rather in the consensus level attack that was leveraged once the price tanked. I'd love to hear the community's thoughts on this.",208.0,2022-05-23 02:56:53,0.7
Could eth become more decentralized than BTC after the merge?,"Can this be translated, in theory, to Eth becoming the best secured network?

My friend built this super user-friendly EVM tool for devs to have easier access to web3 data.,"We all know that it is not that easy for web3 developers(especially for front-end) to access and present Web3 data due to the infrastructure design of blockchains.

To resolve this issue, My friend [DIY](https://github.com/DIYgod) single-handedly came up with this human-friendly open-source project¬†[Unidata](https://unidata.app/) a few days ago. We believe this tool will make Web3 data much easier to access and display for developers.

Docs:¬†[https://unidata.app/](https://unidata.app/)

GitHub:¬†[https://github.com/NaturalSelectionLabs/Unidata](https://github.com/NaturalSelectionLabs/Unidata)

Let's take the most commonly used web3 data ETH NFT as an example to elaborate on the issue.

1. The EIP-721 standard ETH NFT used has a very ""flexible"" format. An NFT image may use various fields, such as¬†`image`¬†`image_url`¬†or¬†`animation_url.`¬†Depending on the publisher's preference, it might not even be an image at all; it could be a video, a 3D model, etc. The inconsistent formats cause a lot of problems for its front-end presentation.
2. Getting all the Ethereum NFTs owned by a given address is also problematic. Ethereum's design requires you to read all the transaction records of that address to get all its Ethereum NFTs. This is an impossible task for the front-end, but can be partially solved by the various data indexing services currently available. However, the data returned by these services are in different formats, each having its own advantages and disadvantages, while each supports different chains. So how should we choose which one to use?

To address the first issue, Unidata has designed a series of user-friendly and uniform data specifications, divided into four sections - Profiles, Links, Assets, and Notes, and Ethereum NFTs fall under the Assets specification. With a fixed data format returned by Unidata, the front-end no longer has to do the troublesome work of adapting a confusing data format.

Unidata currently supports Ethereum NFT and Solana NFT as well, and the data specifications for Ethereum NFT and Solana NFT are unified. In addition, Unidata will continue to support more Assets sources, all of which will also have unified specifications.

Once the first issue was solved, the second is easy: Unidata's approach is to unify and aggregate the data returned by the various services into the same format. For example, the OpenSea service supports the mainnet, the Alchemy service supports Polygon, the Moralis service supports BSC, Arbitrum, and fantom, and the POAP service supports POAP NFT for the Gnosis chain. With a single line of code from Unidata, you can use these services to get all the NFTs for mainnet, Polygon, BSC, Arbitrum, fantom, and POAP at the same time. An online demo can be seen [here](https://unidata.app/guide/assets/ethereum-nft/#live-demo).

Unidata currently supports not only Assets, but also Profiles, Links, and Notes sections. All the services and data sources currently supported can be seen in this [documentation](https://unidata.app/guide/#supported-sources).

\- [Assets](https://unidata.app/guide/assets/)¬†currently support Ethereum NFT(mainnet, Polygon, BSC, Arbitrum, Fantom, Gnosis, POAP), Solana NFT, Alchemy, Solscan, Moralis, and OpenSea.

\- [Notes](https://unidata.app/guide/notes/)¬†currently support Mirror Entry, Ethereum NFT Activity(mainnet, Polygon, BSC, Arbitrum, Fantom, Gnosis, POAP), RSS3.

\- [Profiles](https://unidata.app/guide/profiles/)¬†currently support ENS, Crossbell, Infura.

\- [Links](https://unidata.app/guide/links/)¬†currently support CyberConnect.

Many more features are in progress and will be active very soon.

I built a universal NFT virtual machine.,"Hey Reddit, just wanted to share something cool I‚Äôve been working on.

It‚Äôs an NFT protocol, but different from the usual NFT contracts you‚Äôve seen. 

Most NFT contracts hardcode their minting logic directly into the contract. What I‚Äôve built (It‚Äôs called ‚ÄúCell‚Äù) is not really an ‚ÄúNFT contract‚Äù, but an ‚ÄúNFT virtual machine contract‚Äù. There is no NFT collection-specific logic built into the contract. The contract acts as an operating system that interprets and executes offchain signed messages called ‚Äúscript‚Äù and authorizes whether to mint them into NFTs or not. Which means you can use this offchain scripts to print as many NFTs as you want for free. And it lets you do all that without relying on a 3rd party. If you want to quickly see what it is, I recommend checking out this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVvwy3JuCKo

Another important part of Cell is its ‚Äúuniversal tokenId‚Äù system. Unlike most NFT collections where the NFT creator arbitrarily assigns tokenIds, the universal tokenId ensures that every single unique NFT will have EXACTLY the same tokenId across space and time, regardless of which blockchain it‚Äôs stored on, regardless of which contract it‚Äôs stored on, and regardless of when it was minted, both relatively and absolutely. This is achieved by implementing an onchain IPFS encoder that makes the NFT tokenIds ‚ÄúIPFS native‚Äù. Essentially, the tokenId is a UINT256 encoded version of the tokenURI. You can imagine how this can make the management of cross-chain swaps and managements of NFTs much simpler, as well as making the management of L1-L2 NFT bridging much simpler. Just to be clear I have no interest in building these bridge systems myself, but am thinking about various options to experiment or integrate with existing bridge/L2 solutions, and excited to see where we can go.

Lastly, I‚Äôve built this protocol to be a completely open and free public utility protocol, with no owner. Any company or hobbyist can just start using it without worrying about licensing issues, just treat it like node.js or ruby on rails.

It‚Äôs currently in beta on Rinkeby with fully open sourced/verified code (more in the tweet thread), and planning to go live on ETH mainnet soon.

Huge testing milestone for Ethereum: Ropsten testnet Merge set for June 8,"Merging Ropsten is a huge testing milestone towards Ethereum‚Äôs mainnet merge later this year,‚Äù said Preston Van Loon, an Ethereum core developer at Prysmatic Labs.

The Ethereum ecosystem is set for a ‚Äúhuge testing milestone‚Äù with the Ropsten testnet Merge set to be conducted on June 8.

According to the Merge testnets page on Github, Ethereum DevOps engineer Parathi Jayanathi submitted a pull request for the Ropsten testnet Merge¬†configuration code on Monday, suggesting the implementation is ready to go.

Ropsten is¬†one of several testnets¬†created by the Ethereum Foundation in 2017 and which is currently maintained by the Geth developer team.

This specific testnet is seen as the best replication of the Ethereum Mainnet as it follows a similar network structure. This enables devs to conduct¬†realistic deployment testing¬†before making updates to the actual mainnet.

The Ropsten testnet Merge will see the proof-of-work network combined with a new proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus layer testnet, with its genesis set for May 30. It will simulate what will happen once the actual Merge between Ethereum and the Beacon Chain finally takes place and it¬†becomes a PoS network.

Devs in the community have been posting their bullishness about the testnet news online. Preston Van Loon, an Ethereum core developer at Prysmatic Labs said that..

Layer 2 (zkSync) Swaps and Fiat On-Ramp are Now Live on Numio,"Hello /r/ethereum,

Our timing for this release couldn‚Äôt be much worse but bears haven‚Äôt stopped us building before and they won‚Äôt stop us now.

[Numio](https://www.numio.one/) is a non-custodial, Layer 2 Ethereum, mobile app available on Android and iOS. First released in 2020, we were the first app to be built on zkSync.

## What's new?

**Layer 2 Swaps** \- we‚Äôve added Layer 2 Swaps with our [ZigZag](https://info.zigzag.exchange/) integration which means you can swap tokens quickly and cheaply on the zkSync network.

The cost for a swap is currently under $0.50 - the cheapest I have swapped for is ¬£0.07.

We‚Äôve added the following pairs for now but will be adding loads more (>75) very soon.

* ETH/USDC
* ETH/USDT
* USDC/USDT

**Layer 2 fiat on-ramp** \- you can now purchase crypto directly on zkSync. This feature is supported by our [MoonPay](https://www.moonpay.com/) integration and saves you a lot on gas fees.

**NFTs** \-You can view and interact with your NFT collection in the app.

## A Note on Privacy and Fees on Numio

Numio is non-custodial - you generate your own private keys within the app and can download your private keys at any time.

You can stay pseudonymous - you don‚Äôt need to give an email, phone number, or complete KYC to use Numio - all you need is a username.

Downloading and signing up for Numio is free. Whether you are using Layer 1 or Layer 2, we won‚Äôt charge you to make an account or create a wallet.

## Feedback

As always we appreciate all the feedback we get, so please let us know if you have any comments, requests, or criticisms - we‚Äôre always working to improve.

Thanks",39.0,2022-05-18 09:53:34,0.94
Differences between stablecoins by collateral,"At Wido, we tried to look at the differences between stablecoins as of May 1st, approximately 1 week before UST crashed.

Stablecoins achieve price stability through collateralisation. There are different types of collateral (cash or other crypto assets), let‚Äôs explore it for a few stablecoins ‚Äì USDC, UST, DAI, FRAX and LUSD.

# USDC

https://preview.redd.it/gnkmj6lpguz81.png?width=1684&format=png&auto=webp&s=135b652023acbfd2ae857786db7a890bc7d98662

In the chart above, USDC stands out of the crew. As of May 1, 2022, there was 49B USDC issued, fully backed by US dollars.

Let‚Äôs zoom in to better see the rest of the picture. We will purposefully keep UST for the end.

DAI is an over-collateralized stablecoin, backed by various types of crypto collateral, most notably ETH, WBTC and USDC, as well as real-world assets such as real estate.

As of May 1, 2022, there was \~ **8.46 billion** DAI in circulation backed by approximately **$13.14 billion** worth of collateral, most notably $5.96 billion worth of ETH and 4.37 billion USDC, resulting in a collateralization ratio of **155%**.

Notably, as of May 1, 2022, there also was $1.29B worth of MKR (protocol market cap) that serves as a backstop to protect the dollar peg.

FRAX is an algorithmic stablecoin, partially backed by USDC stable-coin and FXS (Frax Share Token).

As of May 1, 2022, there was **2.7 billion** FRAX in circulation and the protocol‚Äôs collateralization ratio was sitting at **86.75%**, which equals approximately **$2.34 billion** in USDC collateral.

There also was $1.41B worth of FXS serving as a backstop to protect the dollar peg.

Liquity USD is an over-collateralized stablecoin, backed by ETH.

As of May 1, 2022, there was **479 million** LUSD in circulation, backed by 364 thousand ETH worth approximately **$997 million**, resulting in a collateralization ratio of **208%**.

Note: For Liquity, as per their docs, the LQTY token does not serve as a back-stopping mechanism.

In the case of UST, as of May 1, 2022, there was 18.56B of UST total issued.

LFG collateral worth $1B consisted mostly of BTC. On top of that, there was $27.15B worth of Luna, which served as the backstop mechanism.

"Layer 2 in 2022: Are You Ready for Rollups, Bridges, New Apps, Life With Ethereum 2.0, and Layer 3?","We all recall this is a pivotal year for Ethereum layer 2 (L2) solutions so what happens over the coming months will be critical in making decentralized finance (DeFi) work better, faster, and more reliably for a far greater number of users.  

Last year saw L2 solutions roll out with great promise, increasing the number of decentralized apps across verticals such as exchanges, marketplaces, wallets, bridges, and more. Yet the growing user base and total value locked on Ethereum L2 were eclipsed by alternative layer 1 blockchains emerging to fill the market gaps that persisted such as Ethereum‚Äôs scalability issues.

   With multiple apps deployed across chains, we are now seeing increasing fragmentation that adds complexity for end-users and detracts from the ultimate goal of making DeFi accessible for all. We have seen chains like smartchain develop cheap, fast and highly efficient solutions which helps launching of projects like Cake, Minosis, Xvs etc even more accesible.  Ethereum creator Vitalik Buterin has claimed that (L2s or) ‚Äúrollups are in the short and medium-term, and possibly in the long term, the only trustless scaling solution for Ethereum‚Äù. 

 We have seen this start to play out, with the total value locked (TVL) in layer 2 protocols such as StarkNet, Arbitrum, and Boba Network growing from USD 50 million to a high of USD 7 billion.  I look forward to what follows, do you think the L2 will be a total success?",261.0,2022-05-15 18:45:09,0.88
How to sell ethereum without proof of address?,"I have some eth, but I can't find a website to sell it on. I used to use coinbase, but it looks like they don't accept norwegian cards anymore. I moved out of Norway a while back, and don't have access to any documents from the last 3 months proving my address there. I also don't have these documents where I'm staying right now.

Is there a website I could sell on? I've tried zipmex and coinbase as well, but no dice.",237.0,2022-05-15 17:28:36,0.99
"Vitalik himself said that the goal of Ethereum isn‚Äôt million-dollar pictures of monkeys, it‚Äôs to accomplish meaningful things in the world.","I‚Äôm not against NFT art, after all its another integral part of the Ethereum ecosystem. However, I am against the HUGE amounts of resources that are being poured in the NFT market. Resources that will not result in anything of real utility or impact in the real world.

Vitalik‚Äôs vision is for Ethereum to be the portal which people will use to integrate themselves and their lifestyle into the digital world. His vision is for Ethereum to be able to solve real world problems and eventually, down the line, make decentralization the norm and end the tyranny of centralized authorities over our lives. I know this may sound a bit ‚Äúpoetic‚Äù right now but this is the real long term vision.

This is exactly why I love to see that there are indeed a select few projects that have been following this vision, a lot of which are DAOs which fits great with Vitalik's ideals. There are DAOs out there like BitDAO aiding this vision with more than $500 million ETH in their treasury being allocated toward expanding the DeFi space on Ethereum and improving its adoption rates. Crazy to think that a DAO is the 43rd largest ETH holder meaning that they truly do believe in the long term vision of Ethereum.

Hopefully we keep seeing more resources being allocated toward the utilitarian side of Ethereum cause this is the only way to prove that crypto will indeed solve everyday problems and make life all the better. All these billions of dollars combined can be put into much better use. But that's just my (and Vitalik's) personal opinion.",1123.0,2022-05-14 20:32:16,0.95
the only way the Ethereum would ever accomplish mainstream status is through this merge. Energy consumption will go down by 99% meaning that Ethereum will finally be able to experience mass mainstream adoption.,"Some people are really underestimating what this merge means exactly. A lot of people know that it will definitely drive consumption WAY lower, but not many realize that this means Ethereum is going one step forward towards attaining mainstream status.

Aside from the fact that retail companies are pushing all in for eco-friendliness, these companies can‚Äôt operate on Ethereum as long as it's PoW.

Of course, we still need to wait for sharding for Ethereum to actually start showing its real efficiency, but there are already enough scaling solutions to compensate for that in my opinion.

These scaling solutions and L2s aren‚Äôt playing. Polygon alone has already partnered with so many mainstream traditional companies like Ernst & Young, Dolce & Gabbana, Twitter, Instagram and most importantly Stripe which is a BIG step for crypto as a whole considering Stripe is the 6th largest Fintech company in the world and the 5th most used payment app in the US.

And the fact that this company is using Ethereum (even if it‚Äôs through an EVM chain like Polygon) insights a lot of hope that Ethereum is on the right path toward mainstream adoption.",504.0,2022-05-14 16:30:26,0.83

**Frequently Asked Questions**

**Where's the best place to buy ETH?**

There are many centralized exchanges that support Ethereum. If you live in the US, the most popular exchanges are Coinbase, Gemeni and Kraken. Coinbase users can use Coinbase Pro for lower fees.

**When is Eth2 launching?**

Eth2 is a marketing term used to represent a number of updates to Ethereum. The Eth2 proof-of-stake chain first launched in December 2020. ""The Merge"", which is the event that will fully switch Ethereum's consensus to proof-of-stake, is estimated to be ready in early 2022, although there is no exact timeline. Other updates, such as data shards, will follow that update.

Visit [ethmerge.com](https://ethmerge.com/) to learn more about ""The Merge"".

**Do I need to do anything to update to Eth2? Will Eth2 create a new token?**

No, ETH holders *never* need to take any action to keep holding ETH. Ethereum users will be unaffected by the Eth2 upgrade. And the Eth2 updates will not create any new tokens.

**How can I stake my ETH?**

There are two ways that you can stake your ETH: by running your own validator, or providing your ETH to a staking pool.

* Running your own validator requires a modern computer and 32 ETH. Visit /r/ethstaker for more details
* Staking pools accept any amount of ETH. We recommend [Lido](https://lido.fi/) or [StakeWise](https://stakewise.io/)

**Why are Ethereum transaction fees so high?**

Like most blockchains, Ethereum fees are determined by supply-and-demand. The large demand to use Ethereum has pushed transaction fees quite high (however, fees were just a few cents only 2 years ago). Fees are especially high during market volatility, and during NFT drops.

**What is being done to lower Ethereum transaction fees?**

Ethereum fees are reduced by using layer-2 rollups. Rollups are scaling solutions that allow for significantly cheaper transactions, while still maintaining Ethereum's security.

Additionally, Eth2's data shards will make rollups even cheaper.

While rollups are cutting-edge technology being actively developed, a number are already live on Ethereum mainnet. Visit [l2beat.com](https://l2beat.com/) to learn more about rollups.

**What's the best wallet for Ethereum?**

The most popular tool for using decentralized applications is Metamask. However, for security reasons, we recommend using a hardware wallet such as a Trezor or Ledger.

Tried out the Arbitrum Layer 2 tonight.,"I basically only stake ETH using Lido built into Ledger Live.  During low gas times (around 20gwei) you can stake with Lido using Ledger live for about $6 - $8 in gas fees.

The research I have been doing says I need to move to an L2 as most of retail will only use those in the future.

I decided to give it a try tonight.

I transferred $100 to my Ledger Nano S+ and connected it to MetaMask.  I then went to Arbitrums site and deposited the $100 of ETH into the L2 using the bridge.  Gas was around $7 (22 Gwei) at the time.  So I ended up with $93.  

That was successful and I now show $93 of ETH on the Arbitrum network on my Ledger connected to MetaMask.

I then went to Uniswap, connected my wallet to the Arbitrum network and swapped ETH for rETH.  The fee was only $0.65.  It would have been $24 if I had done it on the mainnet.  So 36x cheaper than the Ethereum mainnet.

So this may not have been the best test as I could have staked with Lido for roughly the same gas fees and it‚Äôs much easier using the ledger live interface, but I wanted to learn how to move to an layer 2.

It does get me very excited for the potential of the ethereum ecosystem when Layer 2s are the go to for retail investors and we don‚Äôt have to interact with the layer 1 directly anymore.

It‚Äôs obviously still early days and it‚Äôs needs to be a little easier before mass adoption happens, but I know that will come in time.

I really like that I can still do it all using my Ledger and not have to give up on using a hardware wallet.

Question about debt,"So I have recently gotten into monetary theory. Basically, transactions in the world of fiat are pretty much all just debt being thrown around in the form of government currencies or bank deposits. This means that most transactions change the amount of debt and thereby the amount of money in circulation.

Now, my question is this: Since many coins has a fixed supply but can be lent out, is there a way of knowing how much there actually is including the debt? Do you know any reliable data sources to find out how much bitcoin (or other crypto currencies) have been lent? 

I think this might be especially interesting for DeFi since I wouldn't be surprised if a large amount of ETH for example might be borrowed multiple times. That's kinda what yield farming is about right? Also any form of investing on margin.

"How to stake less than 32 ETH in your own wallet, no lockup, mininal fees","A lot of people use centralized exchanges to stake small amount of ETH, but thereby they give them custody over their coins.

There is actually a very easy way to stake ETH in your own wallet decentralized, without any lockup and with mininal fees of only a few dollars. 

It works through layer 2 Arbitrum and the decentralized staking pool Rocket Pool!

First you need to get ETH to your Arbitrum account. Most big centralized exchanges support withdrawals to Arbitrum, for example Binance or Crypto.com. If you have ETH on mainnet, there is also a bridge from Ethereum mainnet to Arbitrum, but using centralized exchanges to bridge will be cheaper for gas.

You can now use metamask to access your arbitrum account. [Here](https://help.uniswap.org/en/articles/5538707-how-to-connect-to-arbitrum) is a tutorial on how to connect your metamask to the arbitrum network.

After you can access your Arbitrum funds on metamask, there is only one thing left to do: Go to Uniswap and swap your ETH to rETH (Rocket Pool ETH) 

You can do that through this link: [Uniswap](https://app.uniswap.org/#/swap?inputCurrency=ETH&outputCurrency=0xec70dcb4a1efa46b8f2d97c310c9c4790ba5ffa8&chain=arbitrum). (You might have to switch the network to Arbitrum on Uniswap first)

The swap will only cost around $2 dollars on Arbitrum. So you pay less than $5 total in fees, including the exchange withdrawal.

The value of rETH will automatically increase over time compared to ETH, because the staking rewards that are earned through staking in Rocket Pool automatically flow into the value of rETH. At the beginning of Rocket Pool, 1 rETH was equal to 1 ETH. Right now, 1 rETH = 1.02 ETH. 

If the staking pool earns 5% staking rewards every year, the rETH/ETH ratio will go up by 5% in the same amount of time. Thats how you earn your staking rewards.

You can swap your rETH back to ETH at anytime to 'unstake' your ETH.

What's the go-to fully open-source privacy-respecting wallet for the desktop?,"What's the go-to fully open-source privacy-respecting wallet for the desktop?

Most wallets I can find are either closed-source or only partly open-source. However this is unacceptable to me as using these wallets would require trust, which I do not want to rely on when it comes to cryptocurrencies.

Also, ideally I'd be able to either start a local geth instance right from the wallet or at least be able to point the wallet to a locally run instance.  

Hardware wallet integration would be very welcome, too.

Plus I'd really appreciate if the wallet wouldn't send my address(es) to other services unless it absolutely has to.

What would you guys recommend? The wallet comparison on ethereum.org unfortunately doesn't offer a ""fully open-source"" filter.",88.0,2022-04-29 17:43:01,0.94
More North Korean-linked ETH Wallets are being sanctioned by the US Treasury after the $600 million Ronin hack.,"US authorities are enforcing a broader set of penalties against putative North Korean cryptocurrency wallets. On Friday, three Ethereum domains were basically introduced to the Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Asset Control or OFAC sanctions database. Among those three Ethereum, one address was actually named last week. The US authorities linked to the loss of about $610 million in cryptocurrency from Axie Infinity's Ronin bridge. 

Over the previous week, all three accounts had received large incoming transactions. That money is basically looted ether (ETH) from the officially sanctioned wallet. North Korea's Lazarus hackers squad, according to the FBI as well as OFAC, has been diverting funds. They were transferring them from a permitted account to an intermediate address prior to actually transferring the cash to Tornado Cash. Tornado Cash is a mixer intended to conceal the destination address of monies transferred via the service. Companies 

This money laundering process was even replicated on Friday. Money was again transferred from one of the recently sanctioned addresses to a third-party middleman before returning to Tornado Cash.

Tornado Cash has never personally communicated with any of the permitted addresses.
Because of the architecture of Tornado Cash, the company's operators can't ban addresses. The OFAC mandates any entity dealing with the US banking system. 

The mixer has included a compliance tool from Chainalysis. It is a blockchain intelligence business that allows it to ban specific addresses. However, only on the decentralised customer software that Tornado Cash's operators have control over. Individuals can still circumvent this certification tool by using the method itself. Furthermore, the Chainalysis program only revealed the initially approved address as of the previous week.
""OFAC is the arbiter of what addresses have to be actually blocked,"" a Tornado Cash spokesperson initially told CoinDesk.

""So far, it's been a guessing game. It is presume OFAC has found just one address that should be basically authorised in connection with that occurrence. That is to say, Chainalysis modifies whatever is on the penalty list ""explained the spokesperson. Facing all these captivating it has become important to have cryptocurrencies that are easy to track, projects like Polygon, Point Network, Theta, etc, are good examples which can be useful for facilitating multiple transactions which are easy to track.",27.0,2022-04-29 03:03:18,0.85
To any new comer. The merge will reduce energy consumption by a huge margin but won‚Äôt have a significant affect on gas fees. Sharding is what will reduce gas fees.,"
While a considerable number of users on the subreddit have been using Ethereum, L2s and sidechains for a while, there are also new comers joining everyday (niceeee).

I‚Äôm seeing a couple posts here and there about ‚Äúhow will the merge affect gas fees?‚Äù and comments about ‚Äúshould I sell my L2 and sidechain tokens?‚Äù

The answer is no. In fact, the merge will most probably drive more activity on the platform making traffic worse which might theoretically increase the demand on scaling solutions overall.

The end goal is to reach ETH2.0 which is a phenomenally more advanced version of the Ethereum we have now. But that will happen in slow steps and phases. Part of these steps is lowering energy consumption which is the whole idea behind the merge from PoW to PoS.

For now keep your L2 tokens and maybe even accumulate more to cash in on a decent profit. Personally I‚Äôm betting my money on Polygon. They already have the largest number of daily active users between all scaling solutions plus it kinda easiest to build on seeing that they already have 19,000 dApps onboard.

I also think Optimism might have a chance at making it big especially after the recent updates with the token release but I tend to lean more towards zk tech honestly cause I personally think it‚Äôs much more superior and has more potential for the long term.",130.0,2022-04-29 01:26:08,0.93

How to save 90% in gas on Ethereum,"Transactions on Ethereum can easily [cost more than $200 in gas](https://etherscan.io/tx/0x7e3744801b5b5ecf54cee34d80abd07a1f1e401f3d6abd7a9539c7b1b4ae3736). Many projects work hard to solve this problem. Some say you need alternative chains outside of Ethereum. Others say L2s are the solution, and everything needs to stay tightly connected to Ethereum.

Regardless of which camp you support, the truth is that most value is still sitting on Ethereum L1, where gas is unbearable. [According to DeFiLlama](https://defillama.com/chains), $113.89B is locked on Ethereum, with Terra as second and third BSC. In the [Ethereum Layer 2 space](https://l2beat.com/), Arbitrum leads the charts with $3.65B locked, followed by dYdX ($1.00B TVL) and Optimism ($686M TVL). Most interesting apps and opportunities are still on Ethereum.

Many of us have deposits inside protocols on Ethereum. Sometimes, those deposits are not large, and it is economically infeasible to withdraw (gas costs more than the deposit is worth). Or we want to deposit into some smart contract that only exists on Ethereum today, but high gas prices are holding us off.

A question arises: **Is there a way to save gas on Ethereum L1 today before everyone moves to L2s and alternative chains?**

Batch transactions let people save up to 90% in gas on Ethereum L1. Instead of sending a costly transaction on your own, you can batch it with other people and split the gas. Let me explain how batch transactions work using the following diagram:

[Single Transaction \(left\), Batch Transaction \(right\)](https://preview.redd.it/nnw0hh5r2aw81.png?width=1650&format=png&auto=webp&s=c9c1d0f954265a51b2e6cf8b5e7489eb9eda0dc3)

The left part of the diagram shows a single (non-batch) transaction which costs 1M in gas for the user.

The right part shows when multiple users join a batch transaction. Extra ‚Äúbatch smart contract‚Äù is involved, which serves as a proxy between the users and the ‚Äúexpensive smart contract‚Äù. In this case, funds are pulled into the batch smart contract (gas cost is only 90k) from all batch users and deposited into the ‚Äúexpensive smart contract‚Äù as a single transaction.

The result is that in the case of batch transactions, each user only pays 363.33k in gas. This equals 69% in gas savings with just 3 batch participants. Savings increase with more people in the batch.

&#x200B;

**Many people successfully batched their transactions and saved in gas using Wido Batch Transactions.**

Following are examples of recent batch transactions and gas savings:

(1) Withdraw USDC from yvCurve-stETH

* Batch size: 4 users
* Total batch transaction value (in USD): $36,265
* Gas savings: 69.74%
* [Link to Etherscan](https://etherscan.io/tx/0xf64eb05c97e6ae78a99f24aef3cd9838e4b6aeb108d44fe22d8d3fc0e2c39e06)

(2) Withdraw USDC from yvUSDC 0.3.0 and deposit into yvUSDC 0.4.3 (vault migration)

* Batch size: 7 users
* Total batch transaction value (in USD): $226,905
* Gas savings for each batch participant: 61%
* [Link to Etherscan](https://etherscan.io/tx/0xf6cddab208ba1a1e06d46f238cc7745c9a70690f4afadc763fab2e16a28f4016)

**How much gas can batch transactions save?**

Below is a chart showing the ratio between gas savings and batch size. It was calculated for [this transaction](https://etherscan.io/tx/0x7e3744801b5b5ecf54cee34d80abd07a1f1e401f3d6abd7a9539c7b1b4ae3736) (deposit USDC into the Curve Frax vault by [yearn.finance](https://yearn.finance/) using a Zap). The numbers will differ slightly for different transactions.

[Gas savings based on number of users in a batch](https://preview.redd.it/an77mhc93aw81.png?width=2082&format=png&auto=webp&s=ee525587073d07f0228438bc9ef676144dc1965f)

As you can see, with just three people in the batch, everyone saves 60% in gas. With 20 batch participants, the gas savings are almost 90% for each batch participant.

**We are looking for feedback and partnerships ‚úåÔ∏è**

We are happy with the initial results and would love to take Wido batch transactions to the next level to let more people and protocols benefit from gas savings.

We are looking for:

* Suggestions on which transactions do you want to be cheaper? If you are stuck in an expensive vault or plan to deposit into some vault on Ethereum L1: let us know, and we will integrate it into Wido batch transactions so that you can split the gas with others

5 DeFi Risks," I just finished a 2 hour readthrough of Nic Carter's & Linda Jeng's 'DeFi Protocol Risks: The Paradox of DeFi' for the Ethereum Audible Podcast. They point out 5 key risks - which have all come true over the past year.

Here's a brief summary of the 36 page article and 5 risks.

DeFi is growing and is quickly on its way to becoming a new financial paradigm. But...there are financial risks in DeFi that manifest in new ways that we haven‚Äôt seen in the traditional financial system. The 5 risks pointed out are:

1. Interconnections with the traditional financial system
2. Operational risks stemming from underlying blockchains
3. Smart contract-based vulnerabilities
4. Other governance and regulatory risks
5. Scalability challenges.

Let's look at each.

1. **Interconnections with the traditional financial system:**

Stablecoins are the main connection to the existing financial system. They're pegged to fiat, but also via custodian banks. Stablecoins are one of the killer apps for crypto, but offer a centralization risk. Lyn Alden covers stablecoin centralization risk in her article: ""Proof-of-Stake and Stablecoins: A Blockchain Centralization Dilemma"" (did a readthrough of that a few weeks ago: [https://open.spotify.com/episode/3cTMt0friaFdmWwJvbDtmX?si=2MYAbps7Ra-fq50oEbCmUg](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3cTMt0friaFdmWwJvbDtmX?si=2MYAbps7Ra-fq50oEbCmUg))

2. **Operational risks stemming from underlying blockchains**

Consensus failures (aka what happened to [SOL](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23SOL) recently), protocol changes, changing security assurances (PoW or PoS) all can be risk vectors for any protocol built on top.

3. **Smart contract-based vulnerabilities**

All the bugs you can imagine that allow draining of funds. Most famous of which - the DAO hack, but also most recently the Wormhole hack. Oracle attacks also are a vulnerability vector ([https://www.theverge.com/2022/2/3/22916111/wormhole-hack-github-error-325-million-theft-ethereum-solana](https://www.theverge.com/2022/2/3/22916111/wormhole-hack-github-error-325-million-theft-ethereum-solana))

4. **Other governance and regulatory risks**

These risks include bad regulation or multi sig management - aka Axie's Ronin hack. Flash loans can be used to sway governance as well - a new risk unique to DeFi, aka the Beanstalk attack last week.

5. **Scalability challenges**

Inelastic block space can lead to high fees, irregular execution or transactions that don't go through at all - which lead to unexpected edge cases.

To bring it all together, DeFi is developing super fast, bringing more innovation to the financial world than any time since the 1800s. But it comes with new sets of risk. We're in heading west, as they like to say on Bankless!

**Frequently Asked Questions**

**Where's the best place to buy ETH?**

There are many centralized exchanges that support Ethereum. If you live in the US, the most popular exchanges are Coinbase, Gemeni and Kraken. Coinbase users can use Coinbase Pro for lower fees.

**When is Eth2 launching?**

Eth2 is a marketing term used to represent a number of updates to Ethereum. The Eth2 proof-of-stake chain first launched in December 2020. ""The Merge"", which is the event that will fully switch Ethereum's consensus to proof-of-stake, is estimated to be ready in early 2022, although there is no exact timeline. Other updates, such as data shards, will follow that update.

Visit [ethmerge.com](https://ethmerge.com/) to learn more about ""The Merge"".

**Do I need to do anything to update to Eth2? Will Eth2 create a new token?**

No, ETH holders *never* need to take any action to keep holding ETH. Ethereum users will be unaffected by the Eth2 upgrade. And the Eth2 updates will not create any new tokens.

**How can I stake my ETH?**

There are two ways that you can stake your ETH: by running your own validator, or providing your ETH to a staking pool.

* Running your own validator requires a modern computer and 32 ETH. Visit /r/ethstaker for more details
* Staking pools accept any amount of ETH. We recommend [Lido](https://lido.fi/) or [StakeWise](https://stakewise.io/)

**Why are Ethereum transaction fees so high?**

Like most blockchains, Ethereum fees are determined by supply-and-demand. The large demand to use Ethereum has pushed transaction fees quite high (however, fees were just a few cents only 2 years ago). Fees are especially high during market volatility, and during NFT drops.

**What is being done to lower Ethereum transaction fees?**

Ethereum fees are reduced by using layer-2 rollups. Rollups are scaling solutions that allow for significantly cheaper transactions, while still maintaining Ethereum's security.

Additionally, Eth2's data shards will make rollups even cheaper.

While rollups are cutting-edge technology being actively developed, a number are already live on Ethereum mainnet. Visit [l2beat.com](https://l2beat.com/) to learn more about rollups.

**What's the best wallet for Ethereum?**

The most popular tool for using decentralized applications is Metamask. However, for security reasons, we recommend using a hardware wallet such as a Trezor or Ledger.

You can‚Äôt love Ethereum without loving scaling solutions. Ethereum is L2s and scaling solutions at this point,"Like it or hate it, this statement is true.
Ethereum did A LOT of hard work establishing itself as the first and best multi-use chain on the market and cemented its reputation as one of the safest chains out there.

However, becoming the best in one thing, and maintaining that status is another. And so far (at least statistically) Ethereum is the best chain out there in terms of sheer numbers.

This status wouldn‚Äôt have possibly been sustainable without scaling solutions stepping up their game and helping people operate Ethereum.

And this can all be clearly seen with commit chains like Polygon have more daily active users than Ethereum itself considering you literally pay pennies there compared to double digit gas fees on Ethereum along with things like beinf able to mint NFTs for free there.

People want to use Ethereum so bad but would rather do that through scaling solutions.

**TLDR: Ethereum did a great job claiming its spot, but half of the cake goes to scaling solutions for helping Ethereum maintain that position**.",127.0,2022-04-15 21:19:36,0.85
Ethereum and chains on-top of it going greener honestly makes me happier than all the money and pumps in the world.,"I care about the environment more than all the money and technology in the world. I mean just think about it, If there is no earth then what the hell are you going to do with all your Ethereum or your ""lambo"" bruh? This is the one gripe that a lot of people have with cryptocurrency and why they tend to avoid it completely. I don't avoid it completely but this is STILL something I have issues with and I feel like it isn't talked about enough. 

One thing that I don't think is talked about enough is that Ethereum switching to PoS is going to GREATLY reduce it's carbon footprint. This honestly makes me incredibly excited and it makes me want to use nothing but Ethereum and other PoS chains like Polygon. It is built on Ethereum anyway so it's mostly still on the Ethereum ecosystem IMO. Polygon also very recently put 20 million dollars towards making it's chain environmentally positive, meaning that it's trying to help the environment and undo damage rather than kill it.

I think we all want mass adoption for Ethereum and I think this is a way bigger step towards that than people realize. Crypto is a long-term game and what Ethereum is aiming to achieve is a long-term game. Being the foundation for the web3 layer is going to require a ton of sustainability and I think this is an incredible step foward in the right direction for Ethereum. I believe this will bring a ton of environmentally conscious people towards Ethereum over other chains as well.",34.0,2022-04-13 12:35:48,0.73
Former Ethereum Developer Virgil Griffith Sentenced to 5+ Years in Prison for North Korea Trip," Former [Ethereum](https://www.coincarp.com/currencies/ethereum/) developer Virgil Griffith will serve 63 months in prison and pay a $100,000 fine for helping North Koreans use cryptocurrencies to evade sanctions.

In September, Griffith pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy to violate international sanctions against North Korea. Griffith was arrested in November 2019 after giving a talk at a [cryptocurrency conference in Pyongyang](https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2021/09/27/7-nights-in-pyongyang-inside-the-north-korean-trip-that-got-ethereums-virgil-griffith-arrested/) in April of that year.",55.0,2022-04-13 01:41:06,0.91
Ethereum One Step Closer To PoS After Implementation of First Shadow Fork,"Ethereum developers have announced the first successful implementation of a ‚Äúshadow fork‚Äù on the network, which is a big step towards shifting the network to proof-of-stake.

The shadow fork creates a platform for ETH developers to run tests before the networks shift from PoW to PoS. The Ethereum network‚Äôs merge into PoS is expected to make the network faster, cheaper, and more environmentally friendly due to the high energy consumption required to run PoW. The merge is expected to be fully implemented in the second half of 2022. So, if you are confident that it will go through without a hitch, then you might consider adding some ETH to your portfolio.

Do you think it's truly a big deal?

That AVAX is obviously controlled by the hacker. What was the purpose of sending the ETH through Tornado if it can easily be traced to that AVAX address? Nobody is mixing their AVAX either. There's effectively no anonymity set on that chain.

A Deep Dive into the Ethereum Virtual Machine: Part I,"&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/c9aizhzq7os81.png?width=640&format=png&auto=webp&s=ad47a2c0788f25eaf7e880a4deaed7961e62c0b3

Blockchain technology has prompted a massive shift from traditional financial architecture and has evolved from an **electronic cash system to an all-encompassing technological breakthrough** with diverse use cases. Decentralized applications (dApps), built primarily on Ethereum, showcase the true potential of decentralization.  Blockchain technology is, however, still far from mainstream adoption. Ethereum as a network is congested, transaction speeds are low, and costs are high. These issues have become barriers to scalability and have led to the birth of other blockchains.

Cross-chain integration and interoperability are imperative to overcome these barriers. A value transfer system needs to be created that allows both the users and developers to leverage the solutions offered by these new chains.

Different blockchains are written in different languages. Ethereum is written in Solidity. For a dApp to have multi-chain variants, the code needs to be re-written in all different languages, which is extremely cumbersome.

The Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) makes it easier to transfer value between Ethereum and other blockchains without the need for new infrastructure. This connects the different silos of the blockchain with similar ecosystem components and toolkits requiring little-to-no change. There is no need for developers to use different technology stacks to reimplement existing Solidity backend contracts and dApp front ends.

This paper delves into the existing solutions that help to bridge these different blockchains by simply copying the code from Ethereum to other blockchains with minimal changes thus reducing transaction costs.

## The Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)

Ethereum has become the functional layer of the blockchain and the smart contract world. A smart contract is just like any other real-world contract, except it‚Äôs digital. In programming lingo, a smart contract is a computer program consisting of self-executing pieces of code that execute when preset conditions are met. Smart contracts are written in programming languages like Solidity, Viper, Bamboo, and others. A processor does not understand programming languages and hence cannot execute smart contracts. That brings us to the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). **The EVM is the heart of the Ethereum blockchain.**

The EVM serves as a computational engine, just like a CPU, and acts as a middle layer between the smart contract and the operating system. Contracts written in programming languages are compiled to low-level machine instructions called opcodes or operational codes. The EVM uses these codes to execute specific tasks. It thus provides the **run time environment** for smart contracts on Ethereum.

Any distributed network needs to have consensus, whereby every node on the network has the same information about the state of the network. For Ethereum, the EVM enables consensus, allowing anyone to execute code in a trustless ecosystem. The outcome of execution (smart contracts) can be guaranteed and is fully deterministic. It creates a **level of abstraction** between the executing code and the executing machine.

Ethereum‚Äôs state is a large data structure that holds all accounts and balances. It is also a **machine state**, which can change from block to block according to a predefined set of rules. At any given block, there can only be a single state of the blockchain. Ethereum maintains its state with the help of EVM, which does this by defining the rules for computing a new valid state.

In short, EVM exists as one single entity maintained by thousands of connected computers running an Ethereum client. It is operating system-agnostic, and without it, each operating system would need a separate compiler.

## How the EVM Works

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/o38knrwo7os81.png?width=640&format=png&auto=webp&s=0f0665620473bc670af0cd3285758cfca0511fa4

At a **basic level**, the EVM can be considered a translator from the smart contract language to the Ethereum nodes. It enables developers to build and deploy dApps (without the need for an extensive coding background). It makes the process of creating blockchain applications much easier and more efficient while eliminating the need for powerful hardware. The EVM has no downtime and keeps all created objects safe from being modified.

At a **technical level**, EVM is a sandboxed virtual stack embedded within each Ethereum node, responsible for executing contract bytecode. Contracts written in higher-level languages, like Solidity, are compiled to EVM bytecode. The machine codes are completely isolated without any access to the network, filesystem, or any processes of the host computer (hosting the VM). Every node in the Ethereum network runs an EVM instance, which allows them to agree on executing the same instructions. Due to the set of opcodes, the EVM is Turing complete.  A Turing complete system is capable of performing any logical step of a computational function, and that means it should theoretically be able to solve any computational problem. JavaScript, the programming language which powers the worldwide web, widely uses Turing completeness. Ethereum Virtual Machines have been successfully implemented in various programming languages including C++, Java, JavaScript, Python, Ruby, and many others.

There are two types of accounts in Ethereum ‚Äì **external accounts and contracts**. Every account is identified by an address, consisting of a balance, a nonce, bytecode, and stored data (*storage*). The code and storage of external accounts are empty, while contract accounts store their bytecode and the Merkle-root hash of the entire state tree. External accounts have a corresponding private key while contract accounts don‚Äôt. The actions of contract accounts are controlled by the code they host, in addition to the regular cryptographic signing of every Ethereum transaction. The creation of a contract is simply a transaction in which the receiver address is empty and its data field contains the compiled bytecode of the contract to be created.

The first thing that happens when a new contract is deployed to the Ethereum blockchain is account creation. The data sent with the transaction is executed as bytecode. This initializes the state variables in storage and determines the body of the contract being created. The process is executed only once during the lifecycle of a contract. Once a contract account has been created, there is no way to change its code. The EVM treats both accounts the same. A transaction sent from one account to the other can contain **Ether** or **binary** data (payload). If it contains code, it is executed and the payload becomes input data. If it is not set, the code sent is executed and returns the code for a new contract. During the construction, the code of the contract is empty.

Being decentralized, contracts are executed on all Ethereum nodes. This raises the risk of bad actors slowing down the network intentionally by creating a lot of complex contracts. To protect against such attacks, every opcode has a **base gas cost**. For any smart contract to be executed by the EVM, each and every line of code in Solidity requires a certain amount of gas to be executed. The gas is used as per the execution cost assigned to the instruction implemented by the EVM. 

By using the Gas mechanism, two major issues are solved. A validator is guaranteed to receive the initial prepaid amount, even if the execution fails. An execution cannot run longer than the prepaid amount would allow. Instead of looping indefinitely, the execution would run until it runs out of Gas.

When a transaction is sent to the network, validators may take the transaction, executing the associated code. The validator will ensure:

‚Äì Validity of all information on the transaction.   

‚Äì Enough funds are available to pay for the execution of the transaction.

‚Äì The EVM doesn‚Äôt run into any exceptions during the execution.

The EVM achieves Turing Completeness by enabling **an economy that charges as per the execution of software instruction instead of financial transactions**.

*This is a two-part piece written on EVM and the existing EVM options. The first part covers EVM and working at a high level. The second part gives an insight into the existing options on different blockchains.* 

*The subsequent part will cover EVMs on different blockchains.*

I fell for every NFT scam in 10 minutes,"I‚Äôm in a slump. I spent more than a year on an app that helped people build better habits. But it didn‚Äôt make any money, so I started working on an app for a big organization. Working there killed my soul.

I needed something new. While listening to the Tim Ferriss podcast, I kept hearing about Web3.

Web3 sounded like another crypto thing I didn‚Äôt want to hear about. But after the podcast; I became a believer.

Web3 was going to help us move away from big corporations to individual creators. Changing the web as we know it. No one knows where Web3 is going, but that‚Äôs part of the fun.

I started learning how to build applications for web3. Building the future would get me out of my slump. But learning takes time. I wanted to get involved right away.

A big part of Web3 is NFTs. When people think of NFTs, they think of weird internet images. People buy, sell and create these NFTs and they are all tracked on a big ledger called the blockchain.

Web3 proves who owns what. Owning an NFTs give you access to communities, bragging rights and a bunch of other stuff I don‚Äôt understand. NFTs would be my way of joining the Web3 revolution. It was the 1st of January 2022 and I wanted my own NFT.

Within minutes, it was clear I was late to the party. The most popular NFTs, ‚ÄúCrypto Punks‚Äù and ‚ÄúBored Apes,‚Äù were going for millions. I‚Äôd missed the train before they‚Äôd released the timetable.

The lowest price I found for a popular NFT on the auction website Opensea was $30,000. What is going on? Maybe I could lowball someone for an NFT. It is an auction, after all. Fuck it, there was no minimum price to bid. I bid $20 on one of the ‚ÄúCool Cats‚Äù NFTs, which go for thousands. Not sure if my bid went through. I tried again, bidding another $20 and paying the fee again. The fee had left my crypto wallet, but nothing appeared on the website. I refreshed the auction page. I had bid $20 twice. The fees I paid were almost higher than my bids. No one would accept these bids. I had just thrown money into the void.

I told myself it was ok, in uncharted land, explorers make mistakes.

I couldn‚Äôt afford anything from the auction. My low ball approach was dumb. How do I get an NFT before it‚Äôs on the auction? I then discovered minting. Minting is where you pay the fee for a new project to get your own NFT.

On the ‚ÄúCool Cats‚Äù auction page, there was a link to the ‚ÄúCool Cats‚Äù website. Maybe I could mint my own NFT there? The ‚ÄúCool Cats‚Äù website was weird. It mentioned breeding NFTs and a lot of other things I didn‚Äôt understand. After scrolling, I realised ‚ÄúCool Cats‚Äù had created all the 10,000 cat NFTs they had planned. If I wanted one, I‚Äôd have to buy it at the auction. Fuck.

On the ‚ÄúCool Cats‚Äù website, they had a link to their Discord. I thought Discord was just for angry teenagers. But it‚Äôs where everything happens for NFTs. I clicked on the discord link.

I didn‚Äôt know how to use discord. When it first loaded up, I got a burst hose pipe of notifications. I was a boomer for the first time. People talking about trades, $50,000 purchases and roadmaps for new plans. I had notifications, but I had no idea how to make them disappear.

Along with the official messages, there were messages to join other communities. I joined a bunch of these communities at once. I wanted to sample all the ice creams in the store. These smaller communities had funny names like ‚ÄúAge of Sam‚Äù, ‚ÄúThe Honey Badger,‚Äù and ‚ÄúBored Apes Dad Club‚Äù. If Discord confused me before, I had full-blown dementia now. With each community, I got more notifications.

I tackled the groups one by one. First, I clicked ‚ÄúBored Apes Dad Club‚Äù. It had 79000 members. Was that a lot? I had no idea. But if other people trusted it, I trusted it. All you had to do to verify was type a message saying ‚Äò!join‚Äô and then they channel messaged you with a link to a website to verify your wallet. The wallet that holds all your internet money.

I clicked on the verify link and a login popped up. This was strange. My wallet is a google chrome plugin that should always keep me logged in. Did it time out for a security measure? I typed in my password without thinking. The plugin accepted it. But it said for additional security information, it needed my secret phrase. Must be like when your phone says it needs you to enter your pin. I went and got my secret phrase and entered it. When I entered it, nothing happened. It just said error. I entered my password and secret phrase for the second time.

This is when I realized I had fucked up.

What I had entered my password and secret phrase into wasn‚Äôt the official plugin. It looked the same, but it belonged to some randomer living in a shack in a different country.

Giving away your password wasn‚Äôt the end of the world. The end of the world was that I had given away my secret phrase. You should never give away your secret phrase. With your secret phrase, anyone can access all of your accounts. I‚Äôd just given my secret phrase away twice.

I googled what to do if you‚Äôve given your secret phrase away. Hoping for a reset password system or something. The website told me I‚Äôd fucked up. I had to transfer everything to a new account. Which meant fees to transfer and the guilt of being dumb.

Within ten seconds of not paying attention, a hacker could now access all of my internet money. This wasn‚Äôt the start I wanted for my new year.

A better person than me would have realised they needed to be more careful. But I‚Äôm not a better person. I still wanted my NFT.

I figured I had some time before the randomer would steal all my money. Like all addicts, I looked for my next hit.

Another community was offering a mint in six days. It cost about ¬£150 to mint one NFT, this seemed expensive. But everything had been expensive. Maybe ¬£150 was a good price? But I kept looking for a better deal.

I joined another community called ‚ÄòLittles‚Äô. Their verification didn‚Äôt require a password. This community had active members, people reporting scams, and FAQs. Maybe I just had bad luck with my first attempt?

While in the ‚ÄòLittles‚Äô. I received a message from ‚ÄúThe little info‚Äù saying:

‚ÄúWE ARE LAUNCHING A LIMITED SALE. For the new year we‚Äôre offering 777 pixels to be minted.‚Äù

I‚Äôm in luck! I clicked the link, and they‚Äôd minted 764 out of 777. Shit, I‚Äôm going to miss my opportunity. It cost ¬£300 to mint here. I looked up the prices of the ‚Äòlittles‚Äô. The littles sold for $30,000. It was double the price to mint these compared to the other group. But these were making 100 times the rate of return. I refreshed the page, and the number had gone up to 770. There were only 7 left. It was now or never.

I scanned the website to make sure I wasn‚Äôt getting scammed. The website looked legit, with its own security certificate and the URL littlepixel.art seemed to match the discord channel.

Fortune favours the brave. I clicked on the link that said ‚Äúmint‚Äù. This time, a real transaction came up with the correct price, including the fee.

Was I about to spend ¬£300 to get my own online internet image of a cartoon bear? Yes‚Ä¶ I was. I clicked ‚Äòconfirm‚Äô.

It went through and brought me back to the webpage. Bit underwhelming. I was hoping for some confetti. But the blockchain takes time. I went to my transaction history expecting to see a minting job; but it just said I had sent someone ¬£300. I had no NFT in my wallet.

On the blockchain, you can see every transaction. Which meant I could look up my transaction to see where I sent my ¬£300. Turns out I had sent ¬£300 to a random wallet with $77,000 in it.

I went back to the littlepixel.art website. Everything looked legit, but the links on the top didn‚Äôt work. Fuck.

In the scam section of the discord, someone had reported the website as a known scam.

I thought the message from the ‚Äòlittles info‚Äô had come from the official channel. Because of its name and profile picture. But no, it was a direct message meant to confuse boomers like me.

In only ten minutes, I‚Äôd given access to all my accounts to a randomer and then sent about ¬£300 to another scammer.

This was a major defeat. Worst of all, it was the first thing I‚Äôd done in January 2022.

I had lost track of time as the NFT fever had taken over. I forgot my sister had got us a gift to go to a trampoline park. We were leaving for the park in five minutes. Before the person with my secret phrase stole everything I had left in my wallet, I needed to create a new account.

I set up a new wallet and attempted to transfer everything over. I clicked send. But it failed with some obscure message saying ‚Äúgas fee to low‚Äù. Shit. I didn‚Äôt have time for this and didn‚Äôt feel like explaining to my sister we‚Äôd be late because I just lost ¬£300 trying to mint an image of a teddy bear. I tried again by clicking the most recent contact in the list ‚ÄòOxFefhrysgjohjhljkklskd‚Äô or whatever the address was. This time it sent. Thank god.

Destroyed, I walked away, never wanting to hear the word NFT again. I tried to persuade myself that it was ok. It was a tuition fee. But inside I was bitter.

On the trampolines, I tried to bounce out of my depression. Wondering if anyone else in the trampoline park had just lost money trying to buy their own ‚Äúlittle‚Äù that morning.

After taking my anger out in the gladiator arena of the trampoline park, I got home feeling better. I still had some money to work with.

I loaded up the new wallet. It was empty. There was no way the money hadn‚Äôt gone through. It had been hours. I logged into my old wallet. It said I had sent the money.

What was going on? Maybe the person with my secret phrase had emptied the wallet? I clicked on the location I had sent the rest of my money to. It said I sent the rest of my money to the same scammers‚Äô wallet with $77,000. That couldn‚Äôt be. I refreshed the page and tried again‚Ä¶

My gut tightened. I realised what had happened. When I tried to transfer the rest of my money to my new account, the first time, it error‚Äôd. Then when I tried again instead of pasting my new wallet address, I clicked the most recent contact in my addresses. Thinking it was like the most recent person you‚Äôve called on your phone. It wasn‚Äôt. The address I clicked was the contact of the last successful transaction. I had just sent the same scammer the rest of my internet money.

This was the dumbest thing I‚Äôd ever done.

In denial, feeling like Liam Neeson, I tried to figure out who the owner of the wallet was. Hoping I could beg for my money back. I followed where the owner of the $77,000 wallet had transferred the money out. It was a bigger wallet with over $1 million. But the million dollar wallet had withdrawn the funds out in dollars via another website. I‚Äôd never know who they were. My money was gone forever, and I had no NFT to show for it.

Crypto Hedge Fund CEO Predicts Global Adoption of Digital Assets Following Ukraine War," Crypto hedge fund veteran Su Zhu thinks widespread adoption of cryptocurrencies is inevitable as macro events accelerate use-case scenarios for blockchain technologies.

"" *I think what‚Äôs likely to happen is a short-term victory for the West where Ukraine will get the better end of a deal with Russia, but then in the longer term, you will see countries really aggressively move away from overdependence on the existing financial systems.*  *The macro stuff is to understand the way the other traditional financial people view it‚Ä¶ Basically to get in the mindset of a tourist in this market, how they think about whether or not they should own* [Bitcoin](https://www.coincarp.com/currencies/bitcoin/)*, or if they own* [Ethereum](https://www.coincarp.com/currencies/ethereum/)*.‚Äù*

How malicious smart contracts work,"I have a question about how malicious smart contracts work. Many people here probably have some unsolicited tokens sitting in their wallets, and whenever someone asks what to do with them, the chorus always sings ""Do NOT touch it or it will empty your wallet!"" Ok, it's a reasonable advice, but anyone has yet to explain how exactly a smart contract can empty someone's wallet. 

I have a modest experience writing smart contracts, including ERC-20 smart contracts (creating my own tokens just for fun). I also have some experience interacting  with MetaMask from a webpage via JavaScript. So, I know how a user can be scammed into approving access to their tokens and then having their wallets emptied. It's still a long shot, though, since the user needs to be completely clueless and just hit ""approve"" button without reading what it is they're approving. Obviously, this method would require luring a user to your sinister Web3-enabled website first. 

However, if we strictly talk about smart contracts and specifically ERC-20 contracts, can someone explain how calling their functions like ""transfer"" or ""approve"" can give them access to your other tokens that are not managed by these contracts? For example, if I find some sh—ñtco—ñns sitting in my wallet and want to send them to another address via MetaMask, how would it compromise my other tokens? Thanks!",21.0,2022-04-06 00:35:11,0.96
What just happened to the gas price?,"Does anyone know what happened here? I first thought I had a bug in my program. Then I checked etherscan:

edit (since the question seems unclear): I am wondering what caused people to suddenly spend thousands of euros for a single transaction. Was there a short sharp price movement? Was there some launch of any big project that people tried to front-run each other like there is no tomorrow?

**Frequently Asked Questions**

**Where's the best place to buy ETH?**

There are many centralized exchanges that support Ethereum. If you live in the US, the most popular exchanges are Coinbase, Gemeni and Kraken. Coinbase users can use Coinbase Pro for lower fees.

**When is Eth2 launching?**

Eth2 is a marketing term used to represent a number of updates to Ethereum. The Eth2 proof-of-stake chain first launched in December 2020. ""The Merge"", which is the event that will fully switch Ethereum's consensus to proof-of-stake, is estimated to be ready in early 2022, although there is no exact timeline. Other updates, such as data shards, will follow that update.

Visit [ethmerge.com](https://ethmerge.com/) to learn more about ""The Merge"".

**Do I need to do anything to update to Eth2? Will Eth2 create a new token?**

No, ETH holders *never* need to take any action to keep holding ETH. Ethereum users will be unaffected by the Eth2 upgrade. And the Eth2 updates will not create any new tokens.

**How can I stake my ETH?**

There are two ways that you can stake your ETH: by running your own validator, or providing your ETH to a staking pool.

* Running your own validator requires a modern computer and 32 ETH. Visit /r/ethstaker for more details
* Staking pools accept any amount of ETH. We recommend [Lido](https://lido.fi/) or [StakeWise](https://stakewise.io/)

**Why are Ethereum transaction fees so high?**

Like most blockchains, Ethereum fees are determined by supply-and-demand. The large demand to use Ethereum has pushed transaction fees quite high (however, fees were just a few cents only 2 years ago). Fees are especially high during market volatility, and during NFT drops.

**What is being done to lower Ethereum transaction fees?**

Ethereum fees are reduced by using layer-2 rollups. Rollups are scaling solutions that allow for significantly cheaper transactions, while still maintaining Ethereum's security.

Additionally, Eth2's data shards will make rollups even cheaper.

While rollups are cutting-edge technology being actively developed, a number are already live on Ethereum mainnet. Visit [l2beat.com](https://l2beat.com/) to learn more about rollups.

**What's the best wallet for Ethereum?**

The most popular tool for using decentralized applications is Metamask. However, for security reasons, we recommend using a hardware wallet such as a Trezor or Ledger.

Any tips on how to store seed phrase to be accessed from anywhere?,"When thinking about storing seed phrases one of the most common thought is writing it in a paper and store it in some secure place in home. That could be ok to some people, but when the person doesn't feel secure even at home (it could happen for a sort of reasons, local government threats, familiar distrust, natural disaster possibilities, etc), storing it at home could be high risk.

So I'm wondering if there's a security way to store seed phrases and being able to access it from anywhere without a necessity to transport a physical paper with it.

The first thought could be storing it in a cloud, but it also might be very insecure, although in some cases storing at home could be even more.

I'm thinking if a mixed storing would be a good choice, per example, splitting the seed phrase among two or three different clouds.

What happens to ETH lost when staking?,"I've been doing a lot of research into POW vs POS recently. Many sources talk about the advantages of POS, as well as the repercussions of cheating the system. Everyone seems to agree that a selected validator who cheats gets their staked currency taken away (hence why the currency is at stake). I haven't been able to find out what happens to the staked currency after it has been taken from a cheater, however. Does it just evaporate into the ether (pun intended)? Does it get redistributed as a reward to the next person who stakes (or the people who caught the cheater)?

"ETH2.0 is not a ‚Äúproduct‚Äù that will ‚Äúlaunch‚Äù one day. As Vitalik described it, Ethereum will slowly morph into a different more advanced version with subtle improvements overtime.","For a certain period of time, ETH2.0 was part of the roadmap and was expected to ‚Äúdrop‚Äù or ‚Äúlaunch‚Äù at a given date.

Somewhere along the way, this idea started changing and ETH2.0 became more of a concept rather than an actual product.

Ethereum will stay Ethereum but there will be subtle but important events and improvements along the way that combined will culminate in a more mature and advanced Ethereum over the years.

The main focus, as Vitalik stated, should be 2 things:

 ‚Ä¢ The move to PoS
 ‚Ä¢ Sharding

Any additional features act as accessories and polishing for the network to make it as idea as possible.

But for the meantime Vitalik is focusing mostly on Zk rollups as the future of salability for Ethereum.

It was back in 2020 when this decision to build around rollups came to fruition with Vitalik‚Äôs article titled ‚ÄúA roll-up-centric ethereum roadmap‚Äù where he described how Ethereum would be fully focused on rollups.

I think this is part of the reason why Vitalik is so supportive towards Polygon considering how much they‚Äôve invested in rollups and scalability in general (Hermez, Polygon Zero, Polygon Avail, Polygon Edge).

So bottom line is, if you‚Äôre expecting a date of ETH2.0 to ‚Äúlaunch‚Äù then dont cause its more of a combined process rather than an event launching.",706.0,2022-04-02 01:57:52,0.94

the Merge is coming! a few things to expect,"Sharing [this thread](https://twitter.com/trent_vanepps/status/1508478499325202435?s=20&t=RQzPSM9y-R56aF0lAhcILQ) of Merge info so the community can get acquainted with what to expect in a few months.

1. Unburnt fees (aka tips) on the execution layer (EL) begin going each block's proposer - completely liquid on the EL. Over a typical week, this is \~14k ETH / $42mm
2. Due to the amount of work required to properly test and verify the Merge across all clients, Beacon Chain validator withdrawals of staked ETH are only expected to be included in the upgrade after (Shanghai). Work from [@ralexstokes](https://twitter.com/ralexstokes) has started [here](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4895)
3. Post-merge, blocks will arrive exactly every 12s. Today, they arrive in a poisson distribution around \~13s. For devs: do not assume \~13s blocktimes (eg. to calculate an interest rate) - please make sure to use timestamps.  More [here](http://blog.ethereum.org/2021/11/29/how-the-merge-impacts-app-layer/) from [@TimBeiko](https://twitter.com/TimBeiko)
4. **The Merge/ Proof of Stake will not reduce fees on mainnet**. Smaller block/ slot times do increase available blockspace, but not significantly. Av. blockspace is only one input which influences fees, the other being demand. Near-term scaling & lower fees will be on Layer 2s!
5. To any stakers: you should start running a local execution layer (EL) client ahead of the Merge. In the future, outsourcing this to third-party providers will open up stakers to slashing risk under the [Proof of Custody game](https://dankradfeist.de/ethereum/2021/09/30/proofs-of-custody.html)
6. The Merge will use accumulated difficulty (Total Terminal Difficulty) to trigger the PoW‚ÜíPoS upgrade, instead of block height ""An attacker cld use a minority of hash power to build a malicious chain fork that wld satisfy the block height req"". more [here](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-3675#terminal-total-difficulty-vs-block-number)
7. At the Merge, the 2 ETH PoW block reward goes away. new issuance will only come from PoS validators proposing blocks (\~.025 ETH) or ""attesting"" aka voting on network state (\~.00002 ETH)  4.3% PoW issuance ‚Üí .43% in PoS h/t [@litocoen](https://twitter.com/litocoen). Higher security w/ lower spend!
8. Running a node post-Merge does not require any ETH (and never has). This is an important part of Ethereum culture that should be accessible to all. (Staking independently - aka consensus activities - does require 32 ETH. With some providers, it may be lower than 32.",437.0,2022-03-31 15:31:17,0.96
A question for the OG Ethereum people,"What was it like when Eth first came out? back when it was like 31 cents a coin? did people say it was gonna go to shit like they do with other cryptos that are growing now? Or were people sure it was a great idea off the bat? 

Is there any projects currently you get the same vibe from?

Loopring is currently my largest holding and I was wondering what the eth society thinks of it? I want an unbiased opinion really- i think its ridiculous when people say its gonna hit 100$ etc- like blatantly just hyping it up and hopium- but then i think eth went from 31cents to over 3k$ so is it even feasibly possible? the market cap would have to be like 130bil so i think its just mad cos ofc thats huge.

My main questions are how does the current climate of ceertain tokens match up with the original atmosphere of getting into eth? i understand crypto wasnt anywhere near as established back then but really its not that established now.",37.0,2022-03-31 15:14:38,0.84
"Anticipation for ETH 2.0 is at its highest now, and it creates an opening for eth related tokens","With Ethereum completing the final Kiln test onto the new chain, it seems the gates have been opened and everyone is ready for the upgrade, many reasons to be excited about this, but it‚Äôs important to note all the positive effects it will have on the other chains as well. 

You see, ETH doesn‚Äôt work on its own, and it wasn‚Äôt designed that way anyway. As we‚Äôve seen in the past year, many other coins have grown dependent on ETH and have used its blockchain as part of their blockchain, notwithstanding all the positive effects it has had on the DeFi world. 

You see, if it wasn‚Äôt for the success of ETH, DeFi wouldn‚Äôt exist even. It basically launched it into the Ether, literally.

DeFi expands the use of blockchain from simple value transfer to more complex financial services. Specifically, DeFi refers to an ecosystem of decentralized applications ‚Äì autonomous applications that operate using smart contracts instead of relying on an underlying company to manage them.

Apparently, as reported by CoinDesk, some DeFi platforms allow you to pay off student loans even, other platforms like Aloha DeFi function as a gateway into the DeFi space, with NFTs and DAOs within providing win win situations for everyone. A decentralized world that is just getting started but carries much potential. 

Right now, one of the largest sectors within, and the current news item of all mass media, is GameFi, as more and more game companies try to branch out with DeFi to expand the gaming industry.

DeFi‚Äôs value on Ethereum went from $1 billion to more than $100 billion in just 2 years. People are starting to take control of their own financials.,"I‚Äôm not trying to sound poetic here or anything but Ethereum is a financial revolution in the making and we‚Äôre all part of it.

This might be the first time in history where a regular person‚Äôs wealth isn‚Äôt governed by a central body that usually ends up giving back minimally and pocketing the rest.

This 100x growth in 2 years in unprecedented and that growth will only keep on increasing as we see more and more projects focusing on DeFi.

xToken Terminal: Deploy a Liquidity Mining Program on Uniswap V3 - no dev required!,"Uniswap, the most widely used DEX in DeFi, has brought a number of improvements with its V3 upgrade - namely, better capital efficiency via[ concentrated liquidity](https://docs.uniswap.org/protocol/concepts/V3-overview/concentrated-liquidity). But deploying a liquidity mining (LM) program on V3 right now requires technical expertise and development time - it typically requires 2-3 developer weeks.

How do we solve this? Enter,[ xToken Terminal](https://xtokenterminal.io/).

Terminal is a permissionless, no-code platform that allows projects to configure and deploy V3 LM programs in a few easy clicks - with a rich UI, a configurable contract architecture, and powerful features like rewards vesting and multi-token incentives. Terminal is great for LPs as well, allowing frictionless liquidity deployment and an end-to-end experience.

100% of fees collected from Terminal are redistributed to xToken (XTK) stakers. Single asset staking of XTK is available with a current APR of over 40%.

Why I think ZK tech is better than Optimistic tech.,"Regardless of the fact that ZK is significantly faster and more advanced than Optimistic rollups, ZK is focuses much more on privacy.

In my opinion privacy plays a huge role when it comes to this considering that these technologies are available on side chains and commit chains where privacy is always a concern.

This is exactly why I prefer commit chains like Polygon over others since they‚Äôve been focusing a lot of ZK recently to the extent of allocating $1 billion just for ZK tech development and we‚Äôre already seeing that with new products like Polygon ID which basically proves access rights without having to prove any identity.

I love Ethereum and I genuinely think its the best blockchain out there since its proven time and time again to be the most reliable when it comes to to smart contracts. But the fact is that it‚Äôs plagued with traffic problems and most of us now need to resort to scaling solutions. And if I had to choose a scaling solution for the future of Ethereum ZK would definitely win out over Optimistic.",279.0,2022-03-30 06:11:48,0.92

What do you think of rollups as the L2 scaling solution for Ethereum?,"User activity on ETH has seen slow growth due to ETH‚Äôs high gas fees, not surprising, right? I noticed that plenty of users prefer to use Solana and Avalanche as gas fees on all of these chains cost less than a dollar. ETH has less throughput also in comparison to other Layer 1 blockchains.   
 

Various scaling solutions can help in boosting the growth of ETH's ecosystem. But what I've heard is that the rollups have shown the most potential as a scaling solution out of all of these. They can solve significant problems for ETH users, which are high gas fees and less throughput.   
 

I've noticed over time how rollups are enabling transactions at a low cost and have a high throughput capacity without compromising the security as settlement of all the transactions executed on rollups happens on ETH. ETH can act as a settlement layer of the ETH ecosystem while rollups are used as an execution layer.   
 

You know how processing is sluggish, optimistic rollups can boost scalability by up to 10-100x, depending on the transaction. With the advent of shard chains, this figure will rise even further, as more data will be available if a transaction is challenged. The two most widely used optimistic rollups are Optimism and Metis, which allows us to provide extraordinarily quick transactions that take only a few seconds and cost only a few cents while yet preserving ETH Layer 1 security.

Serious question: *Why* should crypto development be based on financial utopia if it isn't a necessary driver to technical success nor consumer adoption?,"The best entity for pragmatically increasing crypto usage worldwide is likely an analog to the best entity for increasing fiat currency usage worldwide, namely a bank or a bank-like entity. Banks as they exist today contain many undesirable features such as [insert your favourite here], which crypto is a good candidate to solve.

Yet, new generation digital banks that exist in certain markets do solve a significant portion of these issues and haven't so far necessarily required crypto to do so. For example, not having physical branches is a big advantage but one that is a business model concern, not a technical programming issue. Similarly, many of the other advantages also have to do with better management and organizational dynamics and economics, something again outside the scope of computer science. 

As a demonstration, consider generically the concept of customer service. I guarantee that you can list off the top of your head significantly more subjective aspects that would improve your experience with a contact center agent than you can list specific problems with IVR software. You wouldn't say that merely having a better coded database is a solution to lower morale or uncompetitive wages, right?

By the same token, why should crypto be treated as the be-all and end-all magic bullet for the system we have today?

This vote will basicaly determine if EU will enforce identification and regulation of every non-custodial wallets such as Metamask, software wallet, Trezor, Ledger etc. This could lead to exchanges refusing to transfer in or transfer out to wallets, making cryptos very centralized and easily controllable by government and their regulators.

"How does the subreddit feel about Polygon building multiple L2 solutions and moving away from being ""just a commit chain""?","Everyone knows that Polygon is currently just a commit chain and not a real layer 2. For some reason people either don't realize or outright ignore the fact that Polygon is building a whole suit of L2 chains. Polygon believes in an Ethereum centric world and the fact that they've put in 1B$ to build these ZK products on Ethereum proves this.

I think this multi-sided approach to ZK scaling on Ethereum is new and pretty interesting. They're aiming to do a whole ""internet of blockchains"" type thing and to my knowledge I do not think this has been done before.  Its products are designed to support the growth of Ethereum as the  network ramps up its user and application base. It‚Äôs worth noting,  Polygon‚Äôs particular focus on Ethereum reflects the company‚Äôs core  belief in the network as the center of the future cross-chain paradigm. 

At  present, blockchain scaling lacks a one-size-fit-all answer, meaning  each startup‚Äôs solution ‚Äì be it Optimistic rollups, Zero Knowledge  rollups (ZK Rollups), or some other alternative ‚Äì has a place in the  current ecosystem. This sort of competitive research effort is what  Mihailo Bjelic, co-founder of Polygon, has referred to in the past as  ‚Äúletting one thousand flowers bloom.‚Äù

For anyone wondering. ZK Rollups are one of the two general categories of Layer-2 rollups,  alongside their peer, Optimistic rollups. At its core, the idea of ZK  Rollups relies on cryptographic proofs to verify changes to the network  state before they are bundled into the Ethereum blockchain. As a result,  some call ZK Rollups ‚Äòvalidity proofs‚Äô. This stands in contrast to  Optimistic rollups, which ‚Äúoptimistically‚Äù assume all transactions are  correct and let verifiers on the mainnet check for fraudulent  transactions over some course of time. Optimistic rollups are also  referred to as ‚Äòfraud proofs‚Äô.

I urge you to look into each of these individual chains on your own as there's too much info for one post honestly but in short. Hermez is placing a high focus on decentralization, Zero is focused on speed, Nightfall has a focus on Privacy for enterprises, while Miden is a STARK and Polygon avail is focusing on Data availability for Ethereum. Polygon edge is also made with developers in mind.

None of this is out there yet and I think Hermez is the closest to going live. \*IF\* all this goes well and they keep their promises then I believe this could be a massive step forward when it comes to scaling Ethereum.

Stuff /r/ethereum should know: Proof of Stake edition,"Poorly informed crypto-journalist articles are constantly coming out, and this brings more Proof-of-Stake related questions and discussions rehashing the same topics and same misconceptions. So here are a bunch of common questions/takes I see, boiled down in quick bullet points like I did in [my previous post](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/s8mnwb/a_collection_of_various_things_the_average/) that was more about Ethereum in general.

I plan on lazily linking this thread whenever I see those points being brought up, and I encourage everyone to do the same and correct me if I got anything wrong or suggest any addition.

## Wat merge?

A lot more info can be found on [ethmerge.com](https://ethmerge.com/) so I will keep this section light

* When the merge happens, Ethereum will be secured by Proof of Stake instead of Proof of Work.

* The Merge is not ""ETH 2.0"", there is no ETH 2.0, [it's an obsolete term.](https://blog.ethereum.org/2022/01/24/the-great-eth2-renaming/)

* **If you currently hold ETH, you don't need to do anything.** You will still hold the same amount of ETH after the merge, there is no ""ETH2 coin"", no need to migrate anything, etc. Everything sames exactly the same, only the consensus mechanism changes under the hood.

* It's called ""merge"" because it's about *merging* the Beacon Chain (*consensus layer*) with the current chain (*execution layer*) and ditching the proof of work part of the execution layer.

* If you don't know, ""consensus"" is just a fancy word for the goal of ordering transactions and getting some economic guarantee that this order won't change. Both PoW and PoS achieve consensus by different means:

  * PoW: ""It costs too much to mess up with the order of blocks, playing by the rules is more lucrative.""

  * PoS: ""It costs too much to mess up with the order of blocks, because if I do I'll lose all the money I put up as collateral.""

* Since it's only the consensus mechanism changing, **Proof of Stake by itself will not lower gas fees significantly**.

## Why merge?

* Lower security costs since there's less energy needed to achieve consensus.

  * For PoW you need miners to be able to *at least* cover all the hardware and energy they use otherwise no one will mine. This requires a big issuance that is quickly sold for fiat to pay the bills.
  
  * For PoS you just need to give some yield to stakers to make people want to deposit capital rather than just invest it elsewhere. No big bills to pay beyond an ordinary computer and an internet connection, so the yield just has to reflect the opportunity costs and risks involved.

* More sustainability:

  * The security of a blockchain is basically proportional to the value of its coin. This is true for both PoW (more valuable coin rewards = more reasons to play by the rules = more miners = harder to mess up the consensus) and PoS (more valuable staked coins = more reasons to play by the rules to avoid losing the staked coins)

  * A newly issued coin is essentially value being taken from all holders of the coin and being redistributed to someone. All else equal, selling that coin for fiat extracts value out of the network.

* It opens the door for many scaling solutions in the future, namely data sharding, statelessness, light clients, and [more](https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin/status/1466411377107558402)

* It helps reduce some complexity of the code going forward, by separating concerns between execution and consensus.

* Appeasing the environment and gamers is certainly a nice side-effect, but not really a major reason behind the switch to PoS, since it's mostly about externalities over which Ethereum as a protocol doesn't have much control (source of energy production, GPU supply chains, etc.)

## Wen merge?

* It happened on September 15th, 2022

## Nope, your a idiot. They will delay it like they always have in the past. They promised it years ago and still haven't delivered.

Believe or not this was a common talking point before the merge

## Those millions of ETH staked will crash the price the very moment they're unlocked LOL

For sure, there will be plenty of stakers who will want to finally take profit, especially those who locked their ETH back when 32 ETH was worth $10k. But there's plenty more to consider on the other side of the equation:

* The merge doesn't unlock any ETH. Withdrawals will come in the first hard fork following the merge, likely 6-8 months after. That's months of no proof of work issuance (~13k ETH/day) being sold off *and* no proof of stake issuance coming into circulation.

* Just like how there's a queue to deposit ETH, there will be [a queue to withdraw it.](https://github.com/ethereum/annotated-spec/blob/master/phase0/beacon-chain.md#how-does-eth2-proof-of-stake-work). Assuming a mass sell-off event, everyone is in that queue, limited at a rate of 1125 valitors per day. So there's no ""opening the floodgates"" moment. Everyone unstaking would literally take over a year. A year of ~38k ETH/day entering back into circulation (or... roughly 1% of average daily volume)

* After the merge, validators will start receiving fee rewards as well, doubling the yield [by some estimates](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1vrK5sY5ooq-F8dcyRhmmAJ5YtgkvWKWP3OfGCZIYxSA/edit#gid=0). There are thousands of people waiting in line to stake *right now*. They're okay with a 5% yield on their ETH, I don't think they're gonna yeet the moment it becomes 10% lol

* The biggest risk involved in staking is *by far* the merge. Something catastrophic could go wrong, yet people have been staking and locking up their ETH for over a year despite this risk and despite the ETH being locked until an unknown floating date. How many people/institutions are waiting on the sidelines for this risk to disappear before jumping in?

* And don't forget stakers exiting means fewer validators which means higher rewards for the stakers who don't exit. It also means more incentives for other people to *start* staking if they weren't before...

* But of course it's crypto, and crypto's gonna crypto. The merge will bring excitement and volatility and possibly a sell-the-news dip, who knows. I don't pretend to know the future, but the way I see it it's much more likely way more ETH will flow *into* staking than out of it.

## If proof of stake is so good, then how come Ethereum didn't go with that from the start?

* Proof of Work is easy to conceptualize and implement, Proof of Stake isn't. Especially when back in 2014 it was mostly a theoretical concept still being researched, with some blockchain implementing some version of it.

* There were several fundamental problems with PoS that needed to be overcome from a research perspective before thinking about implementing it. 

* There is no one-size-fits-all for Proof of Stake. Every PoS blockchain comes with its own PoS specification that has pros and cons on various aspects, so it's not as simple as ""but this other blockchain did it, why can't ethereum just do the same thing""

* Starting as a proof of work chain had the benefit of letting anyone mine coins on their own without anyone's permission, which helped the coin distribution become way better than those newer chains that are proof of stake from the start and have to decide how to allocate the initial coins, which can't really be done permissionlessly.

* Related to above: Yes, there was still a premine/presale for Ethereum, but it has now been diluted to half the supply after years of mining and multiple bull/bear cycles making that ETH swap hands, bringing the distribution [closer to Bitcoin's](https://medium.com/@adamscochran/the-10k-audit-42c100dd32bb). So it's not that big of a deal in 2022 when Ether as an asset is extremely liquid and easy to acquire. 

## Nah, this is really just a ploy to screw over the miners one last time after years of hard work

* PoS has been the eventual goal since [day 1](https://blog.ethereum.org/2014/07/22/launching-the-ether-sale/), everyone mining was always aware that it would end one day. There is no rugpull or unfairness going on here.

* Economic factors trump any kind of miner-blockchain loyalty. You can kinda view the blockchain as a business and the miners as employees:

  * Miners/employees have been paid for the service they provide (namely, secure consensus) with the block rewards. The paycheck is an expense for the employer and it comes from diluting the value of existing coins from holders (see above in ""why merge?"")

  * Miners go to the chain offering the highest rewards, most of them would ditch Ethereum in a heartbeat if another GPU minable coin gave out more rewards. 

  * Similarly, Ethereum will pay less for the service it requires if stakers can do it for way cheaper. 

* It's not entirely exclusive. Miners can also be holders of the coin, and users of the blockchain. Nothing prevents them from holding their rewards and becoming stakers too.

## The coin stops having inherent value if you're not spending real world energy to mine it

I don't really buy this argument. There is nothing magical about computing hashes over and over until you land on one that fits arbitrary requirements. I mean, you could have a proof of work blockchain where the work is done by solving sudoku puzzles and it would work exactly the same: NP-complete problem, hard to compute one way but easy to verify a solution once one has been found. That doesn't mean solving sudoku inherently brings value into the world. Cranking up the mining difficulty of a coin doesn't magically make everyone richer, it just makes mining less profitable ‚Äì unless of course demand goes up too, which so far hasn't been too much of a problem in the crypto world.

The way I see it, the value of a coin ultimately comes from supply and demand, and the demand comes from how valuable the blockspace is. People need ETH to buy the blockspace, regardless of whether that ETH is generated by a miner or a staker. Sure, the more miners there are the higher the security/decentralization which further increases the value proposition of the blockspace in a positive feedback loop, but [feedback loops exist in Proof of Stake Ethereum too](https://i.imgur.com/3bPV35a.png) and they're super cool too!

## Proof of Stake is a recipe for total centralization

* It's basically the same as Proof of Work but slightly different. ""Better"" or ""worse"" really depends on your opinion. The way I see it, PoW is really just PoS with extra steps.

* Ethereum as a community values decentralization highly, any potential centralization vector is addressed by the research team to come up with ways to mitigate it, even if it's at the cost of other important stuff like scaling (e.g. keeping gas limits low so more nodes can participate in decentralization, even if that results in congestion and high fees)

* There **are** shortcomings currently, decentralization is a spectrum and a process and we're not there yet, and for the time being there are many centralization crutches that need to go away on the long term. That said, none of these crutches represent existential risks for the network, and for practically any ""it's centralized because X"" statement, there is an item on [the roadmap](https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin/status/1466411377107558402) addressing X. I personally find it much more fascinating to come up with a whole bunch of stuff to solve X rather than give up and say ""it can't be done because of X"". 

* Something interesting about Ethereum's PoS design that is often overlooked: Quadratic penalties. A single validator going down, messing up, or downright attacking the network doesn't get penalized very badly. A thousand validators doing it at the same time get penalized much more heavily. 

  * This means that if you're a megawhale with thousands of validators, it's in your own best interest to spread them out, avoid cloud hosting, use different clients, etc. Sure, the capital is still concentrated, but at least the points of failures are distributed which is good for the health of the network overall.

  * Compared to a big mining operation that relies on a central location to amortize costs, which can be spotted from energy usage and shut down if the authorities don't like it. It's hard to move mining equipment across the world, but staking only relies on private/public keys and not any actual hardware beyond a consumer grade computer.

## PoS is really just ""who has money makes more money""

* Yes. Unfortunately we live in a world of high wealth inequality. Blockchains don't fix that. 

* It's also true of proof of work: Whoever has money can buy more mining rigs and make more money. Except with mining, the ROI becomes better with economies of scale: Centralized mining operations have the big bucks to get bulk/discount rates on hardware and move to the places with cheap electricity. The solo miner simply can't realistically compete. With Proof of Stake, everyone earns the same yield proportionally, where they stake $10 or $10M.

* ""*They may be centralized, but those big mining operations have no reason to attack the network and weaken it since they dumped millions in infrastructure*""....... so you're saying you're fine with big centralized actors existing, as long as they have some kind of a big *stake* in the network?

## Passive interest on your deposit though? Printing money out of thin air? That's literally central banks and fiat part 2 electric boogaloo

* You have to really stretch it to make this case, but I've seen people do that lol. Those takes usually begin with ""proof of stake is nothing new""

* There's still ""work"" being done by validators: creating blocks and validating other blocks. It's just that the work done is composed entirely of the *actually useful work* that the blockchain needs to reach consensus, instead of computing hashes over and over again until one of them meets an arbitrary requirement. 

* It's not really ""free money being printed out of thin air"", there are still costs involved in staking capital, they're just more abstract and less direct than energy bills:

  * Opportunity costs ‚Äì Why stake at all if another investment offers you a better yield?

  * Illiquidity ‚Äì From the moment you deposit, your capital is locked up, queued up until your validator is active, then when you withdraw there is yet another queue before getting it back.

  * Inherent risks ‚Äì It's still a fairly new thing, something could go wrong, there could be a critical bug, network could get attacked, your staking hardware could get compromised, etc.

  * Volatility ‚Äì at the end of the day it's still a volatile asset, if you're the kind of investor who denominates their investments in their country's fiat currency, then a 5% yield on an asset that can drop 30% overnight isn't all that great (the upside of 5% yield on an asset that doubles is pretty great though, turn that 100% gain into 110%)

  * Maintenance ‚Äì You still have to maintain and secure your validator, ensure 100% uptime, update software, etc. 

* Here's where it gets nifty: The more stakers there are, the lower the individual rewards get. This basically means that all those costs above will get priced by the market itself. It's easy to see why: If the staking yield is too low, then the rewards don't justify the costs and people will pull out and invest elsewhere, bringing the yield back up. Likewise if it's too high, that'll attract more capital and bring it back down. 

* As far as inflation goes: Let's say the market as a whole decides that 5% is the ideal yield, of which 3% comes from issuance. That works out to about 30 million ETH staked printing 900 thousand new ETH per year. At a total supply of 120 million ETH, that's an inflation rate of 0.75%. Which is outpaced by EIP1559 burn as long as gas fees are at least 23 gwei. (I cannot stress this enough: *Ether-the-asset will become a yield-bearing deflationary asset very soon*)

* ""*Nice math but there's no supply cap + they change the monetary policy all the time*"" 

  * The goal has been ""minimum viable issuance to secure the network"" for years, priorizing network security over an arbitrary supply cap.
  
  * No update to the monetary policy has ever increased supply inflation. Low inflation rate (specifically *dis*inflation) has been the goal since day 1.

  * There will be an equilibrium acting as an effective supply cap ‚Äì decided again by market forces valuing Ethereum's blockspace ‚Äì once the rate of EIP1559 burn matches the rate of issuance. That's super nifty if you ask me.

* So yeah, there's no ""central Ethereum bank"" adjusting rates arbitrarily and printing money to cronies. The market itself dictates how much inflation/deflation there is, no single entity can control it the way a central bank controls fiat inflation rates.

## Whales have all the money needed to take over and change the rules and slash honest stakers

* No. Ethereum has no on-chain governance of any kind for this reason. Protocol updates are a community effort (*Layer 0*) and you don't need any money staked to call out bad ideas and participate in the process.

* This is exactly the same as Proof of Work: Even if you have 99% of the hashpower, you can't make invalid transactions that steal people's money without their private keys, or change protocol rules, or really do anything beyond reorganizing blocks. The 1% of honest nodes will reject any block that don't follow the rules and you'll be mining on an invalid/useless chain. Now replace hashpower/mining with stake/staking and the same holds true for Proof of Stake (with the difference that someone caught reorganizing blocks will have their entire stake destroyed, whereas the blockchain can't exactly destroy mining rigs)

* And simply put, there is a fuckton of ETH involved. 10 million and counting and that's *before the merge*. At current prices that's roughly 30 billion dollars. Both ""amount of ETH staked"" and ""value of ETH"" are projected to go up, so attacks become increasingly unlikely due to the sheer economic cost involved in doing an attack ‚Äî *once* ‚Äî and the absurdity of acquiring that much ETH in the first place if the attack comes from an outside actor (where would you buy 10 million ETH to have 51% of the stake? 20M?)

## 32 ETH is way too much, the average person doesn't have that much

* I agree it's a lot. There are some ideas of how it could be lowered ([better signature aggregation](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/rwojtk/ama_we_are_the_efs_research_team_pt_7_07_january/hrmt6o0/) or [a rotating cap of active validators](https://ethresear.ch/t/simplified-active-validator-cap-and-rotation-proposal/9022)) but they don't seem to be very high on the priority list currently, as opposed to making sure the base layer is truly secure.

* The reason for such a high number is it has to fall in a technical sweetspot. In a nutshell, it has to be low enough to be accessible and have enough validators to secure the chain, but high enough to not have too many validators and bloat the chain with overhead. And having a fixed amount for each validator reduces a lot of the complexity by having each validator weighted exactly the same in the distributed randomness process of who gets to produce each block.

* There is a whole bunch of [math involved](https://thomasborgers.medium.com/ethereum-2-0-economic-review-1fc4a9b8c2d9) to arrive at 32 ETH from a technical standpoint, back when 32 ETH was worth about 7000 USD. [Earlier math from 2017](https://medium.com/@VitalikButerin/parametrizing-casper-the-decentralization-finality-time-overhead-tradeoff-3f2011672735) even suggested over 1000 ETH minimum. 

* Thankfully, just like mining pools exist, there are staking pools to allow staking in smaller amounts. It doesn't necessarily fly in the face of the ""not your keys not your coins"" mantra, thanks to things like [RocketPool](https://rocketpool.net/), [Secret Shared Validators](https://medium.com/coinmonks/secret-shared-validators-on-ethereum-2-0-ea29ab380016) (not yet launched) which use smart contracts to be permissionless, decentralized and non-custodian. And because of the quadratic penalties mentioned above, I believe decentralized staking operations will outperform the centralized ones on the long run. I recommend superphiz's [guide to staking](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethstaker/comments/t1xpr5/how_to_stake_on_ethereum_march_2022_edition/) for more info. And obviously, I admit staking through exchanges is yucky if you value decentralization

* Related to above, stuff like Rocket Pool is better viewed as a higher-level abstraction to base staking, rather than ""just a staking pool"". I go into more details on this [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/tijcq1/stuff_rethereum_should_know_proof_of_stake_edition/i1gd27b/?context=1) for those interested.

## PoS hasn't been proven, while we know PoW works

That's actually totally fair and there is no real rebuttal to this, obviously. Only time will tell. I just think it's irrelevant in the context that Ethereum *is* switching to PoS and was always going to. If you don't believe in it, don't participate/invest in it. I do personally believe in a long term sustainable PoS Ethereum, but even then I'm glad good ol' boring-by-design Bitcoin will be there chugging its proof of work along.

It's all part of the great crypto experiment of our lifetime. Either it's just a fad and will fail into obscurity, which would be a bummer for sure, or we'll have succeeded in creating monster robust networks capable of outlasting humanity. To achieve that, prioritizing decentralization is key. Which is something I mainly just see in Bitcoin and Ethereum, despite the widely different philosophies. It's why I'm glad to have both to truly see what's what on the long term.

Effect if L2 chains on ETH 2.0 and future pricing,"I am trying to understand the pricing scenario for Ethereum on the long run.

Also with the proliferation of L2 chains, it  doesn‚Äôt seem like there would be a huge demand for eth as well. 

Unlike bitcoin, i am not sure ethereum has a goal for inducing scarcity to raise prices either .

Would the functionality of NFTs be beneficial to stock media creators?," The majority of stock media platforms charge commission fees ranging from 60 to 85 percent, leaving content creators with low earnings. With the low revenues they are receiving, they don't have a choice but to sell them at a higher price which affects consumers as well. I've also learned that content creators are being forced to sell the rights at significantly lower prices than what the content will actually generate which sucks If I were them.

ETH Vs BTC security model," 

BTC currently trades around $40k and with miner earnings coming 99% from inflation and 1% from transaction fees. Within 10 years, BTC will undergo 3 more halvings. So by 2032, at least one of the following must happen:

1. The price per bitcoin is $320K
2. The hash power and network security is way down.
3. Miners are mining at a loss (perhaps as a public service?)
4. People are paying 100x more fees to use bitcoin.
5. The 21 million hard cap is abandoned.

2-5 will stay regardless, but if we extend out a little farther the price must be $640K (2036), $1.28M (2040), $2.56M (2044), $5.12M (2048), 10.24M (2056) to pay for the same level of security.

While BTC price has more than doubled at each halving so far, I think items 2-5, or some combination thereof, are more likely in the medium term.

It really makes you appreciate ETH's sustainable security budget - constant inflation to pay stakers, burn based on usage.",79.0,2022-03-16 22:58:15,0.85

Rewards from staking after The Merge,"Bankless article [https://newsletter.banklesshq.com/p/dont-sleep-on-the-merge-lite?s=w](https://newsletter.banklesshq.com/p/dont-sleep-on-the-merge-lite?s=w)

Do we all agree that Ethereum will eventually flip Bitcoin and become number 1? I believe so for a multitude of reasons.,"I love the blockchain, I love BTC and above all else. I love Ethereum. I know BTC started this entire blockchain journey, It's #1 and we all love it but I feel like Ethereum just has an absolute metric ton of more real world use cases. It not only is a wonderful chain for DeFi, It has a ton of incredible chains built on-top of it with Polygon being my favorite.

I am really hoping someone more knowledgeable on all this could help me out and explain things further as far as charts and economy is concerned but the way I see it is this. Ethereum is the foundation for many incredible chains with their own ecosystems, Again Polygon being a prime-time example. 

I don't claim to know my shit as far as the price and economy is concerned but I do know my shit as far as tech is concerned and Ethereum is it. Not just the Ethereum chain in isolation but it's incredible ecosystem and the ecosystem's such as Polygon's that are built on-top of it.

**Frequently Asked Questions**

**Where's the best place to buy ETH?**

There are many centralized exchanges that support Ethereum. If you live in the US, the most popular exchanges are Coinbase, Gemeni and Kraken. Coinbase users can use Coinbase Pro for lower fees.

**When is Eth2 launching?**

Eth2 is a marketing term used to represent a number of updates to Ethereum. The Eth2 proof-of-stake chain first launched in December 2020. ""The Merge"", which is the event that will fully switch Ethereum's consensus to proof-of-stake, is estimated to be ready in early 2022, although there is no exact timeline. Other updates, such as data shards, will follow that update.

Visit [ethmerge.com](https://ethmerge.com/) to learn more about ""The Merge"".

**Do I need to do anything to update to Eth2? Will Eth2 create a new token?**

No, ETH holders *never* need to take any action to keep holding ETH. Ethereum users will be unaffected by the Eth2 upgrade. And the Eth2 updates will not create any new tokens.

**How can I stake my ETH?**

There are two ways that you can stake your ETH: by running your own validator, or providing your ETH to a staking pool.

* Running your own validator requires a modern computer and 32 ETH. Visit /r/ethstaker for more details
* Staking pools accept any amount of ETH. We recommend [Lido](https://lido.fi/) or [StakeWise](https://stakewise.io/)

**Why are Ethereum transaction fees so high?**

Like most blockchains, Ethereum fees are determined by supply-and-demand. The large demand to use Ethereum has pushed transaction fees quite high (however, fees were just a few cents only 2 years ago). Fees are especially high during market volatility, and during NFT drops.

**What is being done to lower Ethereum transaction fees?**

Ethereum fees are reduced by using layer-2 rollups. Rollups are scaling solutions that allow for significantly cheaper transactions, while still maintaining Ethereum's security.

Additionally, Eth2's data shards will make rollups even cheaper.

While rollups are cutting-edge technology being actively developed, a number are already live on Ethereum mainnet. Visit [l2beat.com](https://l2beat.com/) to learn more about rollups.

**What's the best wallet for Ethereum?**

The most popular tool for using decentralized applications is Metamask. However, for security reasons, we recommend using a hardware wallet such as a Trezor or Ledger.

How did migration from PoW to PoS happen mechanically?,"Hey all. Mined Eth a bit in college. Digging into crypto a little deeper now a little later in life. I've read a lot about the pros and cons of PoW vs PoS and I'm not looking to start a discussion on that here.

What I'm curious about is mechanically HOW that migration happened (or will happen). I found a report from a few years back that estimated 25,000 full eth nodes, I imagine there are a considerable number of miners outside of the major pools (may be wrong about that?). Can someone explain or link an article as to how the whole network of nodes and miners got updated to a new work model? Is Eth 2.0 going to be a separate currency? What happened/will happen to miners/nodes that failed to upgrade? Who decided to do the upgrade? Is it possible that, if enough of the community decided didn't ""buy in"" to the change of model, the movement from PoW to PoS wouldn't have happened?

CBDCs,"So I realize people don't quite grasp the full story on the CBDC thing. What I see now is what I imagine an intelligent op based, or Neocon based attempt to use CBDCs as a red herring to distract you from the greater danger to crypto. This greater danger is legislation and CipherTrace/TRM surveillance.

&#x200B;

First off you need to understand 6050i recently added in the infrastructure. You're going to need to do some googling, but the TLDR is forcing KYC on developers who make DeFi, putting felonies on them, if they don't collect it from DeFi users.

&#x200B;

There are simply going to be more variations of the same law repeatedly put onto the books.

&#x200B;

What is happening, is the american regime is using all of this as a future pretext to unperson and deplatform people and essentially bypass the 1st amendment through fascist collusion with tech monopolies, and extreme surveillance based on blockchain data.

&#x200B;

But this is entirely impossible in a cash based society. The goal of all of this is to fundamentally get rid of the censorship resistance and cross border nature of crypto, so that it a) can't fundamentally challenge boomer capitalism

&#x200B;

b) can't facilitate cash like payments

&#x200B;

The current war situation is the most intel-psyop ridden propaganda action the West has likely ever done. Duck Duck Go and Google and Youtube are mass purging people, many who were quite left wing, like abby martin.

&#x200B;

all of this after Trudeau, after they turned Russia off with the flip of a switch.

&#x200B;

So how are they going to do this in the future.

&#x200B;

Not CBDC's, but rather mandated KYC sidechains, and mandated wallets, and wallet protocols like aopp. They will fundamentally strangle this industry with narcware wallets, front ends, and backdoors on software and hardware wallets that comply with Fatf. Fatf is a euphemism for a cashless society.

&#x200B;

If you comply with these forms of legislation, and allow KYC to be normalized, you will lose what fundamentally makes crypto crypto. Once they can politically unperson people for nationality and identity, Web3 is no longer Web3, it's no longer international, permissionless, and disintermediated.

&#x200B;

What I'm implying, is that you will not be able to buy anything from a shop without a KYC'd wallet, you will not be able to pay bills, cash out, 0 cash like behavior, no ability to live. Because of CipherTrace and Chain analysis and these mandated sidechains/mandated wallets that are travel rule compliant. They're recreating banks on the blockchain so they can unperson you later. Frankly, they want you to do KYC even to get on the internet, ideally they would like to freeze your bank account, your crypto wallet, and kick you off the internet. The did it in Canada, they're doing it in Russia, Russia is doing it to its own people too in addition to what we did to Russia, they do it to gun sellers, 3d part kits, SWer. You need to learn about Operation Chokepoint, as a legal loophole for this.

**Frequently Asked Questions**

**Where's the best place to buy ETH?**

There are many centralized exchanges that support Ethereum. If you live in the US, the most popular exchanges are Coinbase, Gemeni and Kraken. Coinbase users can use Coinbase Pro for lower fees.

**When is Eth2 launching?**

Eth2 is a marketing term used to represent a number of updates to Ethereum. The Eth2 proof-of-stake chain first launched in December 2020. ""The Merge"", which is the event that will fully switch Ethereum's consensus to proof-of-stake, is estimated to be ready in early 2022, although there is no exact timeline. Other updates, such as data shards, will follow that update.

Visit [ethmerge.com](https://ethmerge.com/) to learn more about ""The Merge"".

**Do I need to do anything to update to Eth2? Will Eth2 create a new token?**

No, ETH holders *never* need to take any action to keep holding ETH. Ethereum users will be unaffected by the Eth2 upgrade. And the Eth2 updates will not create any new tokens.

**How can I stake my ETH?**

There are two ways that you can stake your ETH: by running your own validator, or providing your ETH to a staking pool.

* Running your own validator requires a modern computer and 32 ETH. Visit /r/ethstaker for more details
* Staking pools accept any amount of ETH. We recommend [Lido](https://lido.fi/) or [StakeWise](https://stakewise.io/)

**Why are Ethereum transaction fees so high?**

Like most blockchains, Ethereum fees are determined by supply-and-demand. The large demand to use Ethereum has pushed transaction fees quite high (however, fees were just a few cents only 2 years ago). Fees are especially high during market volatility, and during NFT drops.

**What is being done to lower Ethereum transaction fees?**

Ethereum fees are reduced by using layer-2 rollups. Rollups are scaling solutions that allow for significantly cheaper transactions, while still maintaining Ethereum's security.

Additionally, Eth2's data shards will make rollups even cheaper.

While rollups are cutting-edge technology being actively developed, a number are already live on Ethereum mainnet. Visit [l2beat.com](https://l2beat.com/) to learn more about rollups.

**What's the best wallet for Ethereum?**

The most popular tool for using decentralized applications is Metamask. However, for security reasons, we recommend using a hardware wallet such as a Trezor or Ledger.

If you use a bitcoin light wallet the same thing can happen as you are relying on a centralized node service to connect to the network that can block your ip from connecting to it if desired.

That‚Äôs something ALL light clients have in common by design, no matter the blockchain.

NOBODY can stop you connecting to the network via metamask.

6 Red Flags to Avoid When Investing in NFT-s,"# TOP 6 Major Red Flags in NFT Projects

**When you enter the NFT market as a newcomer, you will most likely encounter many NFT projects that sound almost too good to be true. It does not matter whether you have close to zero or years of experience, people still tend to ignore these easy to remember red flags to separate promising NFT projects from the shady ones. To ensure that you don‚Äôt make these massive mistakes by getting into a suspicious NFT project, we gathered TOP 6 red flags to not ignore by any means.**  


Or watch a 3 minute video instead [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t99EJu\_7GAQ&t=8s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t99EJu_7GAQ&t=8s)

# 1. Undoxxed team

**If you look at the project‚Äôs website and it does not have links to real Instagram, Twitter, or LinkedIn accounts, do not buy the NFT to prevent the possibility of getting scammed.**

**A doxed team, regardless of skillset or background, adds a layer of trust that there are real people building real projects.**

**Recommendation: Question their discord as to why there is no personal information included. If they cannot provide an answer as to why that satisfies your standards, stay away.**

# 2. Fake Twitter or Discord followers/accounts

**There are plenty of sources that will chat on behalf of the team on their Discord server. For example, Fiverr provides a message every min per hour just for $20. Different websites such as GetViral sell Twitter followers for almost no money that will create an illusion of a reliable following.**

**Recommendation: Do a quick audit, for instance use TwitterAudit. Look through engagement on posts to see if there are any real people or just bots. If the account has 120k followers and only 50 likes, it is a red flag. Also check if any notable people follow the account.**

# 3. Artificial hype

**Most shady NFT projects often purchase celebrity endorsements to generate unrealistic publicity around the project. Big names in the field of entertainment such as Thiago Silva can be hired for a silly amount of money to gain people‚Äôs attention in the sketchy project.**

**Recommendation: It is highly recommended to do some research. Dig into whether the partnerships are officially approved or just paid ‚Äúpartnerships‚Äù.**

# 4. Unrealistic mint price

**Hype-based pricing is certainly a real problem in the NFT space. The golden rule to identify a suspicious NFT project is to analyse the mint price. Behind a high mint price there is almost always the combination of hype and FOMO which drives the price unrealistically high. Many projects have nothing of substance to back their price and rely solely on ‚Äúinfluencers‚Äù to boost the price. This results in investing money into those projects because of FOMO and losing everything when the hype dies.**

**Real community builders start the mint price at a reasonable level and do not extract all the liquidity out of the market. Just because the NFT project can demand a high price does not mean they should.**

**Recommendation: A project that allows the original minters to participate in an affordable way is what builds loyal supporters of the project to stick through the storm and lulls. As an opposite, projects that mint at ridiculously high prices often have difficulty finding support during tough times. Therefore, it is important to invest in projects you truly believe in.**

# 5. Predatory tactics

**Floor sweeps: Sweeping the floor in the NFT world means when a specific project buys all its minted NFTS at the floor price. The floor price is the minimum ‚Äúask‚Äù or the lowest price an NFT can be sold on the secondary market. It is the most popular metric for tracking a project‚Äôs performance over time and its relative success compared to others. As an emerging project, floor sweeping can be a method to attract newcomers by guaranteeing low entry points.**

**Banning members: Another predatory tactic to look out for is banning members for listing below prices. This means a member of the project is being kicked out of the community for selling their NFT at a much lower price than the fishy owners of the projects approve.**

**Echo chamber: A big red flag is the existence of an echo chamber. It is an environment where a person only encounters information or opinions that reflect and reinforce their own. This may limit the information the users consume and promote ideas relevant to the NFT project.**

**Recommendation: Step out of the chamber (Discord, forums etc) for a few days. This often allows for the head to clear so better judgement can be made.**

**Other popular red flags to watch out for are harassments of any kind, threats and piggybacking of popular projects.**

# 6. Meta clich√©

**If the project fails to bring more than little innovation by introducing repetitive meta or roadmaps, be cautious. This can be an alarming indicator that the project is most likely going to take advantage of your money to cover its own interests. In addition, if the project fails to address legality concerns over securities and insurance of tokens, consider exiting the project.**

**Meta is easy to copy, and tokens can be launched only in a matter or hours. On the contrary, real economies take months or years to create.**

**The lack of ability to create proper Tokenomics or P2E for sustainability and longevity is also a worrying measure. For instance, the owners of the Bored Ape Yacht Club can participate in exclusive clubs and areas of the BAYC. This is a good way of thinking in the future and gaining people‚Äôs trust.**

**Tokenomics: The goal of a Tokenomic analysis is to understand the potential value of the project by considering all aspects of a token‚Äôs creation and management, including its supply, allocation, and distribution. The reason why Tokenomics is so important is that it helps to ascertain the future worth of an asset by giving an insight into the profitability of one asset over the other in the future.**

**P2E (Play to Earn): indicates a type of gaming that hinges on NFT technologies. For example, gamers can play video games and virtual worlds for rewards by making an initial investment in the NFT.**

**Identifying these red flags may be a long arduous journey of separating the real NFT projects from the quick cash-grabs, but once you understand the importance of it, success is guaranteed. Unfortunately, there are no blueprints to follow in this new industry, which means there are no right or wrong ways to approach a project.**

**Start by looking for niches and teams with the ability to execute. Find out who is the founding team, and how they work, what their values and grand vision are. If they show lack in respect, transparency, or communication, consider moving on.**",100.0,2022-03-02 13:58:15,0.82
Moonshot: Solving the Ukraine crisis with Ethereum and Game Theory,"Hear me out.

"UNI V3 simplified, let xToken Terminal be your guide........","  


Hello r/ethereum! I‚Äôm Chad, Community Manager from xToken. 

In this post, I‚Äôd like to introduce xToken, outline the capabilities of our soon-to-launch platform xToken Terminal, and lay out the business case for using Terminal‚Äôs Liquidity Mining app.

**About xToken** 

Since we launched in July 2020, we've served thousands of DeFi users with our native staking and liquidity strategies, processing over $300 million in primary volume across our funds and peaking at $150 million in TVL. Given our deep expertise with Uniswap V3 strategies and unique experience working with other DeFi projects, we‚Äôve transitioned to building DeFi infrastructure to simplify financial primitives.

Our new platform, xToken Terminal, aims to be the most trusted and robust capital markets and liquidity management platform for Web3. We want to provide DeFi projects with seamless access to fundamental on-chain primitives. Mining, the first app deployed on Terminal, allows a project to deploy and configure a customized Uniswap V3 liquidity mining campaign in a few easy clicks ‚Äî freeing up valuable development resources while providing an enhanced user experience, added configurability, and augmented security.

**Why Should I Incentivize Liquidity on V3?**

Uniswap V3 is a step-function improvement in the AMM space, offering better capital efficiency for liquidity providers, improved execution for traders, and a more powerful launchpad for DeFi infrastructure. We believe that liquidity will continue to migrate from V2 (and elsewhere) and that V3 will cement itself as the preeminent DEX.

For DeFi projects and DAO‚Äôs alike, maintaining a strong liquidity presence on Uniswap V3 enhances community access to your token(s), while helping to promote discoverability and connectedness with the rest of the Web3 ecosystem. 

**The Problem with Current V3 Liquidity Mining Solutions**

Unlike V2, integrating with the Uniswap V3 contracts requires significant development expertise. Projects pursuing LM on Uni V3 spend precious resources developing custom contracts or writing complex off-chain scripts ‚Äì time that could be used to develop the core product offering. 

While there are a few active solutions currently being used in the ecosystem, we believe there should be a complete, end-to-end solution with customizable features, top-notch UX and an emphasis on trustlessness and discoverability.

**The Terminal Difference**

With Terminal‚Äôs Mining app, xToken has built an integrated, configurable architecture that allows partners to permissionlessly configure and deploy V3 liquidity mining programs in a few easy clicks.

What makes Mining the best solution for Uni V3 LM?

* Ease of use for pool sponsors: 
   * DeFi projects can deploy and configure a highly customized LM program via the intuitive Terminal UI in a matter of minutes
* Ease of use and end-to-end experience for LPs
   * Users deposit liquidity through the Terminal UI and are immediately earning rewards. No need to engage with multiple UIs or deposit LP tokens to external staking rewards contracts
* Full feature set
   * Sponsors can customize their programs with any Uni V3 price range, multiple rewards tokens and an optional vesting period on rewards
   * The data-rich Terminal UI provides useful pool data for both sponsors and LPs
* Enhanced security
   * Our contracts have been audited by ABDK and CertiK and we‚Äôve launched an ImmuneFi Bug Bounty program.
* Low fees
   * We charge a small one-time pool deployment fee and a 1% fee on distributed rewards. All fees from rewards are paid back to $XTK stakers.
* Discoverability
   * All deployed Mining pools will be viewable on the Terminal app, providing a new way for DeFi users to discover your community

Obviously there are more problems in the integrity of elections beyond the choice of digital infrastructure (oppressive regimes would not adopt a transparent system, for one).

Announcement: Flexpool.io is halting all service to Russia," As  everyone has heard, Russia has launched a surprise invasion of Ukraine.  The world is again faced with war, which could signal the next and  possibly final war. This may be the biggest war since WW2, bigger than  any of us, and goes beyond politics or nationality. This is a war at a  time of peace when we are busy dealing with and recovering from the  COVID-19 crisis. People are dying, and the world is guessing whether the  West will join in or watch Ukraine fall to Putin's ambitions.

We  generally do not get involved in politics despite our personal views as  a company. However, this is greater than politics, greater than anyone.  This is a war that may end the world. It certainly is ending the lives  of many innocent people in Eastern Europe. While there is little we can  do, it would be wrong to profit off of it or fund it indirectly. We are  canceling service to all Russian IPs and paying out outstanding  balances.

We apologize to our  Russian miners; many of you do not support the war. However, it is you  who are supporting your nation. Without the people, Russia cannot  operate. It is only through reducing the economic power of its people  that we have a chance of affecting this war. We thank you for your  loyalty, and I hope you understand that we do not make this decision  lightly. Should this situation be resolved peacefully, we will happily  welcome back all Russian miners and use our personal funds to make it up  to you.

If you are in Ukraine and  reading this now, know that the world is with you.  We can't change the  situation ourselves. We call on other companies and people around the  world to join us and make a difference together. This isn't about  politics; this is about preventing the end of the world and saving  lives. Companies and people need to put the planet over profits in the  modern era. Ukraine has four nuclear power plants. Even ignoring the  chance of WW3, there is a chance of another Chernobyl should one of the  plants be endangered. The Fukushima nuclear disaster in Japan happened  despite the plant having been forewarned so that they were shut down and  built to withstand an earthquake. Everyone in Europe, Russia, and the  Middle East are in danger of nuclear fallout should the worst happen.  Notice that the world will only end not because people do something but  because people know yet choose to do nothing.",505.0,2022-02-24 18:33:07,0.86
The [REDACTED] ETHDenver 2022 Report,"The outlet for whom this article was intended got cold feet about running it, so here's my report on ETHDenver 2022...

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

The first ETHDenver was in 2018, deep in bear market doldrums. Hopium was lost. There was a whiff of vapor in the ware. Rumor has it that ETHDenver programming that year was just Gitcoin founder Kevin Owocki in a rented bufficorn costume offering bounties for free hugs to an empty auditorium. Even in those salad days of free-wheeling pre-COVID physical contact, few people accepted. Oh, how things have changed.

After surviving an existentially challenging bear market and a near apocalyptic pandemic only to emerge stronger than ever, the mood amongst ETHNerds at ETHDenver 2022 was buoyant, only a gentle caress short of euphoric. Over 20,000 applicants for an event that could comfortably have accommodated a tenth of that meant this year was always going to be an unprecedented clusterfuck. That sense of euphoria lasted only until attendees encountered the line to get in. ETHDenver‚Äôs (ostensibly noble) COVID test upon entry policy meant a three hour wait to get in as the line snaked down the block, across the street, and almost into adjacent time zones ‚Äî all caked in a post-snowstorm slurry. And wait they did, in droves, and for days on end.¬†¬†

That kind of excitement can only mean one thing. Lines for a COVID test. Lines for the elevator. Lines to get into talks. Lines for the bathroom. Lines *in* the bathroom. Crypto has two modes: Apocalypse and utopia. ETHDenver was firmly the latter. Self-flagellation is out. Self-congratulation is in. That‚Äôs because Web3 and DeFi and NFTs and DAOs have all achieved mainstream buzzword status, and none of those exists without Ethereum. You can tip people with ETH on Twitter. Fucky Zucky thought hijacking the metaverse could save his sinking ship. He must be sniffing metamine. Shit, Even Melania Trump bought her own NFT. And if Trump Org is grifting in your backyard, there‚Äôs gold in them hills. It‚Äôs a whole different kind of gold rush out here in Denver.¬†

The thing is that Ethereum tech actually works now. Well, sorta. It may cost $73 and take a few hours, but if you want to spend $23 million on a jpeg of a monkey ‚Äì that utopian reality is yours for the making. Do you want to loan a derivative of a derivative of a derivative of a dog-themed meme coin? Sure! Just please don‚Äôt call it a derivative or the SEC will sue everyone. APY? In this economy?! Fuck that. What‚Äôs your yield by the *nanosecond*? Imagine your favorite, most esoteric MMORPG, but with the graphics of a 16-bit Animal Crossing. Sounds not bad, right? Now imagine it with a JPMorgan Lounge. That‚Äôs Metaverse, baby!¬†¬†¬†

At any crypto event, you‚Äôre gonna hear a heap of new lingo: Ponzinomics, POAP, danksharding, pussyverse, proto-shard data-blobs. Did you know that play-to-earn can solve poverty? That must have something to do with the Doge-wrapped McLaren parked in front of the Art Hotel. It was gone by day 3, so here‚Äôs hoping that someone vandalized it.¬†

It‚Äôs 4pm on a weekday in the Castle, in a cavernous side room shrouded in fog and laden with the rolling thud of house music. Countless exhausted future Bufficorns lay supine in beanbag chairs, staring at the canopy of lasers above them weaving cerulean and lavender spears. Excited groups of kids share shots of liquor. A one man dance party shuffles alone in the center of the room until a gaggle of girls bound into the space and join him. Is this a tech conference or a music festival?¬†

This could be the year that ETHDenver became SXSW for Crypto. It looks like the NFT gold rush has blown the space wide open culturally. The cool kids have arrived, and en masse. You can spot them because they share the same fashion aesthetic as a bored ape: animal prints, goofy sunglasses, glittering sequins, thousand yard stare. It‚Äôs too much for some, mostly the jaded blockchain marketing vets standing confused on the outskirts of all things, wondering how they haven‚Äôt downloaded Metamask mobile yet despite working in crypto for a half decade. They‚Äôve spent a good portion of their careers slaving for ‚Äòblockchain adoption,‚Äô and now that it‚Äôs staring them in the face, they have no idea how to react other than slugging liquor for brunch, dazed,  mumbling to themselves about ConsenSys equity.¬†

Their energy is in stark contrast to the chillionaires, the very rich, very relaxed individuals with very few complaints about life. They‚Äôre the guys who bought hundreds of thousands of ETH at a fraction of a dollar. You can spot them because they‚Äôre wearing multiple rolexes on each arm, board shorts and flip flops, even in frigid-ass Denver. Nobody spots them faster than the bizdev shills, though, who are like guppies into the maw of these mega-whales. Here‚Äôs how you survive a hard sell from one of those desperate pitchmen who treat you like a microphone: smile and nod, smile and nod. Do not answer any of their rhetorical questions, because they‚Äôre all just hooks for another shill. Smile and nod. That‚Äôs how a thousandaire becomes a chillionaire.

While incredibly well socialized Ethereum developer Danny Ryan is on stage discussing semantic mismatches in the transition to Proof of Stake, the din from the reaches of the castle is deafening. Grizzled developers in newly spangled swag sweatshirts yuk it up with NFT obsessives in bedazzled leopard print, comparing shillhaul ‚Äì which this year included free weed, USB lighters, and translucent metal sporks. Tiesto is in the building. The governor of Colorado just showed up. Vitalik‚Äôs mum is holding court. Someone dressed as Boba Fett saunters through the crowd.¬†

‚ÄúThe merge is really, actually very close,‚Äù Ryan exhorts over the noise. That gets everyone‚Äôs attention. Ethereum Maxis talk about the merge like Heaven‚Äôs Gate members talked about the comet. It‚Äôs the second coming of Jesus and Jobs and Jehovah alike. On the day the *don‚Äôt-call-it-ETH2.0* shards enliven, Vitalik will ride into the floor of the NYSE on a pale unicorn atop a rainbow that rains coins to save us all from our current reality: the one in which we‚Äôre already in a bear market and nobody except for VC Cunts and chillionaires have the wherewithal to admit it yet.¬†

Speaking of: Look to your left. Now look to your right. chances are that one of you is a VC cunt. The ‚ÄòVC‚Äô stands for ‚Äòvery cunty.‚Äô A message to your ilk from the rest of us: Take your billions of dollars, your fuckin‚Äô social skills, your well-adjusted attachment styles, your consistent sleep habits, your workout routines, your pearly white teeth ‚Äî and go copy/paste someone else‚Äôs Ponzi scheme!¬†

In the spirit of self-congratulation, ETH devs are here to PARTY. That means drinking enough alcohol to maintain eye contact! Woo! A fresh-faced, motor-mouthed young Web3 acolyte who works for a VC ‚Äî¬† although he promises it‚Äôs not a cunty VC ‚Äî has a salient piece of advice for anyone, but especially those in crypto: Never meet your idols. He encountered one of his at an ETHDenver afterparty, a guy ‚Äòworth a quarter of a billion at least,‚Äô languishing in a catatonic state, mumbling about ‚Äòthe best acid in Denver.‚Äô Apparently, that did not fit his idea of a post-millennial tech baron. He‚Äôs learned better now.¬†

An interlude: What does a stablecoin have in common with a dominatrix? It‚Äôs all fun and games until you‚Äôre in too deep and they lose their peg. If it‚Äôs UST, you‚Äôre moving back into mom‚Äôs basement. If it‚Äôs your local Mistress, you‚Äôre going to the hospital. You‚Äôre fucked either way. 

Speaking of fucked: DAOs may be both the ‚Äònew venture capital‚Äô and the ‚Äònext sovereign nations,‚Äô but you may not get that vibe from the myriad DAOs that have proliferated in recent times ‚Äî BluntDAO, PartyDAO, SporkDAO, SlutDAO, for example. DAOs may change the world yet, but not until they roll a blunt, have a boogie, get the munchies, and visit a sex worker ‚Äî so just like most politicians, then.¬†

While an opera singer takes to the stage on the upper BUIDL floors for an impromptu performance, surprise guest Andrew Yang appears on the main stage. The room is packed and the audience listens on rapt. The wider crypto industry has been waiting on tenterhooks on the promise of a damaging Executive Order from President Joe Biden, and Yang has the inside scoop. He‚Äôs bullish on the EO, saying it won‚Äôt be as bad as many fear, but bearish on the long-term prospects of governmental meddling in the space. He says it‚Äôs a call to arms moment for the industry, and that we should all take it upon ourselves to fight back. He suggests gamifying lobbying, which actually sounds like a pretty good idea.¬†

All of this isn‚Äôt to distract from the main point here: a conference with all the Etherati in one place is totally against the ethos of decentralization. Single point of failure! That‚Äôs blockchain 101. What happens if one disgruntled Solana dev sneaks into the Castle with a bomb strapped to his back? They are capable of this. Those guys blow up their own chain on a monthly basis.

The real stuff at ETHDenver is on the upper floors of the Castle, where the devs have been at work hackathoning away since before the hordes arrived, and where they remained when the hordes left. Developers are more mythical beast than the bufficorn could ever be, and here‚Äôs where you find those rare creatures in their habitat, buried deep behind the hype machines and money printers. Rows and rows of people, heads down, headphones on. This is the actual source of the substance of the event, the whole industry even. Shit, maybe even the whole world. Every so often, they take breaks to eat stale pizza and play DDR and Mario kart in the arcade, drum and bass blasting all the while. It‚Äôs on these floors that  you‚Äôll find anything resembling solace in the chaos.¬†

ETHDenver is a place where the developers who build the stuff, the shills who sell it, the storytellers who narrate it, and now the consumers who actually use it are all there under one roof. Yeah, it‚Äôs disorganized, but this is the kind of chaos from whence *stuff* happens. When things get organized, they get lame. ETHDenver is the Birthplace of BUIDL, and it retains that accolade. Sure, 20,000 applicants and only about 150 hackathon projects offers a ratio of about 1 in 20 builders to shillers, but that‚Äôs pretty fucking good for crypto. Your average Bitcoin conference is just a mass congregation of undersexed sociopaths yelling past each other about Wikipedia-level macroeconomics. In comparison, ETHDenver is a wellspring of substance and positive energy.¬†

Unfortunately the price of ETH did not mirror the buoyancy of the energy of ETHDenver, dropping over 15% over the course of the week. But nobody talked about markets or asset prices, even as they dropped precipitously and consistently all weekend. There‚Äôs something beautiful about that. ETHDenver envisions itself as a builder of culture for Ethereum, decentralization, and the creation of value in communities, and it does come good on that promise.¬†

There‚Äôs two surefire ways to know when a party is over. The first is when you receive a COVID exposure notification from the exclusive afterparty the night prior. The second is when fuckin‚Äô Diplo shows up. Both happened on Sunday night. The Denver airport was apparently like an Ethereum transaction mempool on Sunday night, so most of you are using the same criteria for figuring out when it‚Äôs time to GTFO.¬†",106.0,2022-02-23 16:20:25,0.94

"If you think NFTs are useless, you're wrong! Here's why (prove me wrong)","I always find it funny that people are so quick to call NFTs a scam when it's a space that is so new and still finding its feet in Web 3,0. Funnily enough, it's always towards the trading component and never about use cases outside of this niche within the space. Usually, because they have no idea of the other utility that's being created and built.

It's undeniable that the list of use cases will continue to grow and they will become part of our lives over time. Some of the below are either happening now or will eventually become tangible in 2022-23.

**Vertical Marketplaces**

NFT projects will shift towards DTC marketplaces like larvalabs and SolanaMBS. Managing user experience is critical for retention, and eliminating 3rd parties doesn‚Äôt hurt.

**Soulbound NFT's**

NFTs are lauded for their transferability, but there are many use cases for non-transferable tokens: driver‚Äôs licenses, diplomas, certifications, proof of attendance, etc. Soulbound NFTs lock-in provenance, and can not be sold.

**Retail Sector**

Retailers from 7-11 to Gamestop will use NFTs to incentivize IRL transactions, leveraging creators to drive traffic to storefronts. For example, Yeezy NFTs that airdrop with purchases from Gap stores, or NFTs that unlock exclusive features for Tesla vehicles.

**Borrowing Platforms**

Because NFTs can unlock temporary access‚Äîlike entry to conferences‚Äîmarkets for short-term lending are emerging. Imagine this as a marketplace: StubHub, but for NFTs.

**NFT Indexes**

Getting exposure to hundreds of NFTs via indexes will boom as market movers tap collectors for funds. Imagine a Christie‚Äôs NFT ETF. They have the influence to get assets to liquidity‚Äîinvestors will ape into that. It will also broaden support for NFT communities.

**Bounties**

Creators and brands will drop unique quests within communities, rewarding completion with NFTs. This could be anything from completing a questionnaire to referring members into the community, to attending events. Bounties can be highly competitive, or open wide.

**Social Investing**

Web3 streamlines investing by reducing manual processes like spreadsheet mgmt + signature collection. It also acts as a social record‚Äîstartups like PartyRound will build networks around such activity, and reinforce them with NFTs.

**Legal**

The benefits of block security and its ability to trigger transactions via oracles will accelerate the adoption of web3 legal services + contract development. A DocuSign killer (or acquisition target) will be built in 2022, and it will deliver NFTs to contract executors.

**Services**

NFTs will unlock access to services and hobbyist communities. Q&As and tutorials with influencer chefs, photographers, doctors, and niche enthusiastic communities will boom. This will also extend into IRL services like transportation, hotels, and spas.

**Content Submission**

Users will submit content like short-form videos, reviews, and tutorials in exchange for NFTs. It‚Äôs a marketing flywheel. Rights can be programmed into contracts so that the use of the contributor‚Äôs content in advertising could yield their future profits.

**Activism**

Communities, where NFT ownership supports political causes, will gain traction as millions flow into community wallets. Imagine environmental NFT collectives where sales are directed towards lobbying efforts, and those efforts are coordinated by a community DAO.

**Social Feed Marketplaces**

Social feeds based on NFT collections will emerge, providing insight into the strategy of top collectors, and a platform for collectors to interact. These feeds will evolve into social commerce marketplaces, featuring reviews, analytics, and more.

**Multiplayer**

NFTs will create hive activity by incentivizing group behavior. MMORPGs that unlock levels once 10k users have aped in. Airdrops of rare NFTs to collector cohorts that have signed contracts to merge their base-layer NFTs. Collecting is going to become a team sport.

**Collateralization**

To date, lenders have been averse to NFT holders borrowing against their assets. But as institutional money flows in, and assets become better stores of value, collateral markets will promise flexibility and liquidity for all NFT holders, not just whales.

**Fractionalization**

Splitting up NFTs into individual shares gives more people exposure to blue-chip assets, like owning a piece of a CryptoPunk. The result? More liquidity for holders and more appreciation of blue-chip assets as money enters the markets.

**DeFi**

As enthusiasts become more comfortable staking and farming their holdings for yield, NFTs promise incentives beyond APY%. NFTs will become base DeFi assets, with community access included. These won't be simple savings plays‚Äîthey'll also be investments in communities.

**Loyalty Exchanges**

As brands and creators seek to reinforce loyalty, community behavior will be rewarded with NFTs. Did the member contribute content? NFT. Complete surveys? NFT. Make a purchase? NFT. Tokens are more liquid and bragworthy than traditional discount codes.

**R&D**

Brands and creators will exchange NFTs for insights on product development: pain points, marketing claims, roadmap, and more. The NFTs will unlock early access to product releases and potential profit sharing. Brands will track and maintain these key relationships.

**Customer Cohort NFTs**

Imagine receiving an NFT for being one of the first Air Jordan customers, and how valuable that would be today. How Nike might reward you years later with special access and product. Cohort NFTs prove that you took a certain action, at a certain time.

**Education and Customer Support**

Upon demonstrating exceptional knowledge of a brand‚Äôs product, users can receive NFTs in exchange for onboarding newbies into the community, or providing support. This can be exponentially more impactful than a brand employee doing the same.

**Leaderboards**

NFT communities will gamify by highlighting the performance and participation of top holders. Top contributors will receive rewards and clout, thereby incentivizing communities to hold and participate in order to secure better returns on their investments.

**Frequently Asked Questions**

**Where's the best place to buy ETH?**

There are many centralized exchanges that support Ethereum. If you live in the US, the most popular exchanges are Coinbase, Gemeni and Kraken. Coinbase users can use Coinbase Pro for lower fees.

**When is Eth2 launching?**

Eth2 is a marketing term used to represent a number of updates to Ethereum. The Eth2 proof-of-stake chain first launched in December 2020. ""The Merge"", which is the event that will fully switch Ethereum's consensus to proof-of-stake, is estimated to be ready in early 2022, although there is no exact timeline. Other updates, such as data shards, will follow that update.

Visit [ethmerge.com](https://ethmerge.com/) to learn more about ""The Merge"".

**Do I need to do anything to update to Eth2? Will Eth2 create a new token?**

No, ETH holders *never* need to take any action to keep holding ETH. Ethereum users will be unaffected by the Eth2 upgrade. And the Eth2 updates will not create any new tokens.

**How can I stake my ETH?**

There are two ways that you can stake your ETH: by running your own validator, or providing your ETH to a staking pool.

* Running your own validator requires a modern computer and 32 ETH. Visit /r/ethstaker for more details
* Staking pools accept any amount of ETH. We recommend [Lido](https://lido.fi/) or [StakeWise](https://stakewise.io/)

**Why are Ethereum transaction fees so high?**

Like most blockchains, Ethereum fees are determined by supply-and-demand. The large demand to use Ethereum has pushed transaction fees quite high (however, fees were just a few cents only 2 years ago). Fees are especially high during market volatility, and during NFT drops.

**What is being done to lower Ethereum transaction fees?**

Ethereum fees are reduced by using layer-2 rollups. Rollups are scaling solutions that allow for significantly cheaper transactions, while still maintaining Ethereum's security.

Additionally, Eth2's data shards will make rollups even cheaper.

While rollups are cutting-edge technology being actively developed, a number are already live on Ethereum mainnet. Visit [l2beat.com](https://l2beat.com/) to learn more about rollups.

**What's the best wallet for Ethereum?**

The most popular tool for using decentralized applications is Metamask. However, for security reasons, we recommend using a hardware wallet such as a Trezor or Ledger.

My dad has 8 ethereum in a MEW account he forgot about..,"My dad recently told me he has 8 ETH tokens he bought 5 years ago in an account he can‚Äôt seem to access in MyEthereumWallet.com (edit: I meant to say MyEtherWallet.com) but kept the print out of the address and private key. Apparently he‚Äôs tried contacting MEW and there‚Äôs no one there to support. I‚Äôve never used MEW myself but I want to help him get access to his money. I have a Coinbase account but I‚Äôm not super familiar with how this works. Is there a way to use the keys to transfer the funds to cash out?

Update: I was successful and was very easy to recover. There‚Äôs a way to access your wallet using just your private key on the MEW platform without logging in (tho it‚Äôs not recommended). Once I accessed it I was able to send all the ETH it to my coinbase account with an address I generated and now I can cash it out or hold on to it for my dad. Can‚Äôt wait to tell him tomorrow.

Gonna buy my first ETH soon. Couple of beginner questions.,"Hello r/ethereum. I have been researching this project for a little while and I am going to buy some Eth soon. I was hoping you all could help me with a couple questions.

1. I am considering either Binance Us (in the usa here), Coinbase Pro or Kraken to buy it as from my research these seem like widely used reliable exchanges with the lowest fees and most coin options? Are these good exchanges? What exchange/trading app is the best to buy Eth on? Why do you prefer it/what are the fees (and are they the lowest/if not why do you prefer it)? Which would you recommend for Eth (or any coin) and why?
2. I want to purchase a Ledger Nano X to store my crypto after buying it. Is there one of these exchanges that is best/easiest to transfer your funds to a hardware wallet like this one? Does anyone here have experience with doing specifically this and could explain or point me to some info explaining how it works?

Why is a validator punished for downtime in Proof of Stake?,"So in ETH PoS scheme (and in the PoS scheme of other cryptocurrencies), staked tokens can be slashed if the validator is offline for too long. But why? Why can't the network be designed to be resilient to such failure? In Proof-of-Work, no miners or full nodes get punished if they just stop. They only stop receiving rewards when they stop, not getting their existing profits retracted.

I'm concerned about this because this ""always-online"" requirement scares away most people from running a validator on their own (that plus the 32 ETH is too expensive). This encourages centralization.

[Official docs](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/consensus-mechanisms/pos/#pos-staking-validators):

Selling a NFT feels like im working with TicketMaster,"So okay okay...the title of this post is mostly a joke. 

So a couple months ago I minted an NFT for like $150. lets see some of the fees that went into this.   
Going to approximate since I dont remember them exactly. 

Item sold for about 1ETH today

1. $30 minting transaction fee 
2. $70 open sea fee to list item for sale at  fixed price
3. $50 open sea fee to later change sale to an auction
4. $316.5 (10% creator fee)
5. $158.25 (5% royalty fee) 
6. $94.85 gas transaction fee to complete sale.

Are you kidding me. Like yah overall I made money on this sale but this is insane. Seems the only reason this is considered acceptable is because people are making a ton of speculative trading anyway.

I made a tool to analyze my gas usage across multiple blockchains. Here are the results:,"In total, I spent over $3000 just in gas fees on 809 transactions across 5 different blockchains: Ethereum, Avalanche, Fantom, Binance Smart Chain, Polygon.

To see my spending trends over time, I plotted all my transactions on a scatter plot. For convenience, I also linked each transaction to its chain explorer transaction details page to get full insight into the transaction.

To compare the average transaction cost among blockchains, I created a pie chart. In terms of the cost per transaction, Polygon wins hands down, and to nobody's surprise, Ethereum is a gas guzzler. One caveat is that this chart does not differentiate between different types of transactions which may skew the final results. As an example, I perform a lot of contract interactions on Avalanche which, in theory, would bring its cost per transaction up.

"In my opinion, the cannabis industry deserves a DeFi solution","In light of the fact that governments are gaining control over anything crypto-related, I'm skeptical that the DeFi will actually be successful. Many markets have been left without viable answers, and one of these is the cannabis industry.  


Despite the fact that cannabis has been legal for quite some time, there have been several complaints about a lack of established DeFi solutions for the market. This has resulted in a great deal of frustration. Why can't we have anything we can use when the number of decentralized alternatives continues to grow and the majority of people are unable to comprehend it and instead choose to purchase shitcoins?  


As a cannabis consumer and follower, I've always questioned why, after all this time, there hasn't been a successful non-schematic cannabis project to date. A decent effort that seeks to bring the community together, Tangi appears to be a good example of this. The fact that many legal cannabis outlets only accept cash as payment further demonstrates to me that there is space for competition",22.0,2022-02-11 21:23:22,0.8

No one is going to look at that and say its positive for the industly.

Ubisoft, for example, was too vague on their announcement and resulted in heavy backlash with little to no support of their decision.

However,

if instead of directly selling the NFTs through a marketplace for use in game, you find them in game to exchange wherever youd like. No one wants to give more money to greedy companies but I personally would be okay giving money to someone who grinded for days to get a weapon with favorable stats and is now selling it on an ingame or off game marketplace. Asking a company to exchange value without it being given to them is a stretch I know but if one company does it well, people wil start to realise theyre just throwing money and time at a company that gives you nothing in return.

If you allow for an open and free marketplace of in game items, it would naturally build trust in the company as well as keeping the value within the people that actually play the games. Plus, NFTs gives you true ownership over your assets. Yes, I know its a centralized game, but, the assets belong to you. If your account gets banned because you decided to use one too many offensive words, your items would still be in your possession despite not having an account. You retain value of your in game progress even if they decide you dont deserve to play their game.

the technology obviously isnt developed far enough for anyone to incorporate that into their game just yet, but I dont get the people who say blockchain gaming will never take over the industry. I personally would rather play a game where I own the items than a game where i can pay for them to allow me to use their items.

Woke up this morning and found 0.92ETH drained from my wallet.,"I don't know how it happened, I might have left my MetaMask connected to some site I minted from in the past few days but I am gutted I started that walled from like 0.05ETH and work it it all the way up to  close to an ETH and then bang. I do not know what to do is there ANY way to get it back? Or any way I can contact someone to help assist with this? Probably a long shot but what can I do. How can I stop this from happening in the future? Please help. Thanks frens.

"Sequoia just invested 450 million dollars into Polygon, This is not only big for Polygon it is big for Ethereum too.","This  news literally just dropped on CNBC. Sequoia The Silicon Valley venture  capital firm led a $450 million investment in Polygon. I think this is  massive as far as mass adoption for Polygon is concerned. A VC like this  putting in this kind of money into your product speaks volume.

These  are people who have ran many successful companies and businesses. They  know a successful product or ecosystem when they see it. I think when  VCs invest into something this intensely then we as small time investors  should take note. These people have teams of researchers, they know a  ton that we don't about tech and the market.

Frankly  with how things have been going for Polygon. I'm not surprised to see  this kind of money starting to circulate and these kinds of people  starting to take note. 1M users on Opensea, The fastest ZK around and  the fact that the ecosystem went from 3,000 dApps to 7,000 dApps in a  couple of months are things to take note of for sure.

""Polygon  plans to allocate $100 million of the funding to an ‚Äúecosystem  fund‚Äù  supporting the development of new projects on its network. The  rest  will serve as¬† ‚Äúbuffer money‚Äù to help Polygon‚Äôs 240-person team   continue building out the platform in the years to come."" - A quote from  the CNBC article.

I think the  above quote speaks volumes to Polygon's plans for the future and I'm  incredibly excited to see where this is going to go.

**Frequently Asked Questions**

**Where's the best place to buy ETH?**

There are many centralized exchanges that support Ethereum. If you live in the US, the most popular exchanges are Coinbase, Gemeni and Kraken. Coinbase users can use Coinbase Pro for lower fees.

**When is Eth2 launching?**

Eth2 is a marketing term used to represent a number of updates to Ethereum. The Eth2 proof-of-stake chain first launched in December 2020. ""The Merge"", which is the event that will fully switch Ethereum's consensus to proof-of-stake, is estimated to be ready in early 2022, although there is no exact timeline. Other updates, such as data shards, will follow that update.

Visit [ethmerge.com](https://ethmerge.com/) to learn more about ""The Merge"".

**Do I need to do anything to update to Eth2? Will Eth2 create a new token?**

No, ETH holders *never* need to take any action to keep holding ETH. Ethereum users will be unaffected by the Eth2 upgrade. And the Eth2 updates will not create any new tokens.

**How can I stake my ETH?**

There are two ways that you can stake your ETH: by running your own validator, or providing your ETH to a staking pool.

* Running your own validator requires a modern computer and 32 ETH. Visit /r/ethstaker for more details
* Staking pools accept any amount of ETH. We recommend [Lido](https://lido.fi/) or [StakeWise](https://stakewise.io/)

**Why are Ethereum transaction fees so high?**

Like most blockchains, Ethereum fees are determined by supply-and-demand. The large demand to use Ethereum has pushed transaction fees quite high (however, fees were just a few cents only 2 years ago). Fees are especially high during market volatility, and during NFT drops.

**What is being done to lower Ethereum transaction fees?**

Ethereum fees are reduced by using layer-2 rollups. Rollups are scaling solutions that allow for significantly cheaper transactions, while still maintaining Ethereum's security.

Additionally, Eth2's data shards will make rollups even cheaper.

While rollups are cutting-edge technology being actively developed, a number are already live on Ethereum mainnet. Visit [l2beat.com](https://l2beat.com/) to learn more about rollups.

**What's the best wallet for Ethereum?**

The most popular tool for using decentralized applications is Metamask. However, for security reasons, we recommend using a hardware wallet such as a Trezor or Ledger.

Why wouldn't Proof of Stake drastically reduce block times vs. Proof of Work?,"I heard that [Proof of Stake will only reduce block time by \~1 second to 12s](https://blog.ethereum.org/2021/11/29/how-the-merge-impacts-app-layer/). Why only 1 second?

Intuitively, it would seem to me that Proof of Stake (PoS) should be able to drastically reduce block times vs. Proof of Work since it replaces the computationally expensive PoW piece and the arms race nature of everyone mining at the same time with random validator assignment. Thus the bottleneck under PoS would only be the network latency it takes to propagate the newly created block to the number of validators required for consensus (51%?) + time it takes for those validators to validate/attest that newly created block and propagate their attestation back to everyone else. I don't know what the block propagation latency on ethereum is to reach 51% of nodes, but I can't imagine that being more than a few seconds.

I understand that reducing block times too low under Proof of Work would be offset by increased computational waste and forking (due to everyone mining concurrently and network latency). But wouldn't this problem be eliminated under Proof of Stake, thus enabling faster block times (and subsequently higher transactions/second)? **(EDIT: I elaborated on my reasoning in** [**this comment**](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/slzfsd/comment/hvtw4et/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)**)**

Is there a detailed explanation/analysis somewhere comparing Proof of Stake vs. Proof of Work from a performance standpoint? Why is Proof of Stake only 1 second faster than Proof of Work?

Layer2 Sunday - Resources to help you get started using next generation Ethereum today üî•,"Hi everyone,

You may have heard about the next generation of Ethereum scaling solutions, seen a little bit of chatter about starks, snarks and roll-ups, or even come across the hashtag #L222 - and wanted to dip a toe in and actually try it out rather than just reading about it?

As pointed out in the 2021 Year in Ethereum review, scaling is not only already here, but devs and users are already migrating and the next wave of innovative DeFi, NFT and Gaming projects are launching: [https://stark.mirror.xyz/q3OnsK7mvfGtTQ72nfoxLyEV5lfYOqUfJIoKBx7BG1I](https://stark.mirror.xyz/q3OnsK7mvfGtTQ72nfoxLyEV5lfYOqUfJIoKBx7BG1I)

Over time, less and less dApps will even launch on L1 and many will be L2 only, so it's time to save yourself some fees and get moving to the next frontier of Web3.

If you're ready to be early to the next wave, then today is the day. Sunday is the quietest day of the week for blockspace demand and the time that bridging your hard earned ETH becomes cheapest. There's no better time to take the leap. Quick, before the apes decide to mint another 10k jpegs! [https://www.gasprice.io/](https://www.gasprice.io/)

Hardware wallet for blind/visually impaired people,"Is there any (forget good) hardware wallets for blind or visually impaired people? Barring that, is there any Android-based hardware wallets where talkback can be enabled... that also have headphone jacks? If there are, are they actually usable with talkback(read: are all of the buttons labelled? Are at least the common buttons labelled)? And, If somehow there is an answer to all of that, is it less than #1,000. I did a basic search and this topic does not appear to have come up before. If it has, I would appreciate a link to an old discussion.

Edit(for future me):
Of the mobile wallets I have tried nearly all of the ones listed as being compatible with Arbitrum as of Feb 2022 and the only one that I can actually get loaded as Trust Wallet. Metamask wants a password but when I enter 8 characters into both text fields... the next button remains greyed-out(likely that I mis-typed one of the m, but nothing says that so I amnot going to do the work the developer should have done)

Rainbow wallet has ""fields"".. in quotes because they have the exact same label as the actual label and are obviously customer widgets because Voice Over doesn't announce them as secure text fields(Why did Rainbow implement customer password fields? WHo knows ? Are they recording my password? They wrote the app so that seems like a lot of work for something that they get anyway. 

Nearly all of the others use customer interface elements so I assume they all use flutter or some other ""cross-platform"" development environment. 

DeKey wants me to buy a card but they have other unlabeled elements for their software wallet. Why should I buy a card or a biometric authenticator? Will it work with my iPhone? Will it work with Android? DOes it need a dongle? The spare cards appear to work for both Ethereum and their other blockchain. Why would I need a different reader for two different blockchains? Does it plug directly into the phone? 

How do these companies make any money? Is it the trading fees? Why is there no paid app I can get? Why do all of the websites appear to be cut from the same cookie cutter?

It is frustrating that I can't even throw money at this issue(Fiat or crypto apparently).

How Ethereum scales: ELI12,"In short: Ethereum scales with rollups & data availability sampling. But what does that mean?

Firstly, I'll note that the Ethereum roadmap is evolving, so whatever you may have read is already out of date. Especially all the 2018/19 articles about sharding and ""Ethereum 2.0"" - yeah, those are obsolete. Here, I'll briefly describe the state of affairs in February 2022.

# Rollups

Rollups are layer 2 chains that fully inherit Ethereum's security, decentralization, liquidity & network effect properties. [Multiple rollups are live today](https://l2beat.com/), with application-specific rollups like dYdX, zkSync 1.x and Loopring mature & optimized already. Smart contract rollups like Optimism, Arbitrum and StarkNet are in their early stages and awaiting optimizations through 2022.

Optimized rollups today are capable of $0.10 transaction fees with up to 4,500 TPS. Certain highly optimized rollups like dYdX can even scale up to 12,000 TPS. The likes of dYdX, Immutable X and Loopring actually have zero gas fees for trades as it's abstracted from the user. But this is just the beginning. This is like smart contracts in 2016.

The next question becomes - how can we push rollups further?

1. Rollups and application developers themselves will continue to optimize. We have seen Optimism decrease transaction fees by 30% in January, with another 30% cut due soon. Arbitrum also cut their fees in January, with Arbitrum Nitro estimated to slash fees by 50%. This will continue throughout 2022. [Aave developer Emilio describes](https://twitter.com/The3D_/status/1485732340571807745) how they have reduced transaction fees 10x to $0.16-$0.25 on optimistic rollups through optimizations. These are some examples - costs on rollups will continue to decrease over time as they mature.
2. Unlike L1s, rollups get cheaper the more activity there is. So as rollups mature, there's more activity, and token incentives, we'll see rollups get cheaper.

# The Surge

The Surge are upgrades to Ethereum consists of multiple steps that will open the floodgates for rollups. First, we will have intermediate steps like [EIP-4488](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4488) or [blob-carrying transactions](https://notes.ethereum.org/@vbuterin/blob_transactions_simple). These will drop transaction fees by 5 times or more, over and above the two points described above. At least one of these intermediate steps is likely to be implemented around the end of 2022.

The final stage for The Surge is [danksharding](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/sh1trh/danksharding/) \- a data layer built specifically to accelerate rollups. This integrates data availability sampling, and ushers in a new paradigm for blockchains. With data availability sampling, the more decentralized your network is, the more capacity there is for rollups. As bandwidth improves and Ethereum decentralizes, capacity will continue to increase. Over the years, there'll be enough to have millions of TPS across rollups - enough so the whole concept of TPS and transaction fees melts away. We'll be sitting and laughing about the time we used to worry about gas fees. Danksharding will roll out over time, with the first steps likely happening in 2023.

# Statelessness & zkEVM

With The Surge, rollups will have massive scale and ultra low transaction fees. But Ethereum L1 will still be expensive. This doesn't matter because the end users will all be on rollups. But Ethereum L1 will also scale, first through statelessness, and then several years down the line with zkEVM. Even then, the cheapest fees will continue to be on rollups, which is why most people will just use rollups.",503.0,2022-02-04 11:32:14,0.96
Moving MATIC from Coinbase (Pro) to Polygon Network,"I am trying to get my MATIC tokens that are currently on Coinbase Pro onto the Polygon network. I am amazed that there is not better documentation on this process. 

I have gathered that MATIC can only be transfered from Coinbase Pro onto the Ethereum network. Some exchanged, like [crypto.com](https://crypto.com), allow for transfers directly from the exchange to the Polygon network. If that service is not offered by your exchange, you will need to bridge it yourself. This will be a bit more expensive because it requires moving to something like MetaMask and then using the bridge. This is at least two transactions and moving MATIC on the ETH network is not cheap. 

I have transferred from Coinbase Pro to MetaMask. I am now attempting to use the official Polygon bridge - [https://wallet.polygon.technology/bridge](https://wallet.polygon.technology/bridge). Unfortunately, even though I have ETH and MATIC in my MetaMask wallet, the bridge is not recognizing that I have funds. I have connected my MetaMask wallet to the bridge and signed the transaction. Still, it does not recognize my funds. They are stored on my Trezor. I tried with a different MetaMask wallet that is not associated with my Trezor. This seemed to recognize that ETH was in the wallet, but still thought that I had 0 ETH. 

Any ideas on moving MATIC from exchange to Polygon network. Also, general ideas on the best way to get funds on the Polygon network (i.e., exchanges other than Coinbase)",22.0,2022-02-03 23:27:59,0.89

"Here's how 98k ETH was stolen on Solana, explained like you're five","There has been a lot of confusion however how the Wormhole hack had happened, and exactly whose side is at fault. Unfortunately, there is a lot of misinformation going around, and many people are not technical. I'd like to explain how this works.

-----

# ELI5 version:

To create wETH on their chain, Solana checks that there is a valid signature, and that the signature comes from a Guardian.

Proper usage means there is a valid signature (Correct ‚úÖ) from a guardian (Correct ‚úÖ). These two conditions match, and so request is approved. ‚úÖ

They expected an attacker would issue an invalid signature (Incorrect ‚ùå) from a guardian (Correct ‚úÖ). These two conditions do not match, so the request is denied.  ‚ùå

-----

# The hack

The attacker issued an invalid signature (Incorrect ‚ùå) from a non-guardian (Incorrect ‚ùå). **But these conditions match: incorrect matches incorrect**. So the request is APPROVED ‚úÖ(!!) and the ETH was stolen on the Solana network.

The Ethereum network successfully processed a withdraw, because Solana told Ethereum ""it's all good, this is legit"", but Solana's logic for determining whether it is good was flawed.

For programmers: the check was `==` instead of `&&`.",1709.0,2022-02-03 01:35:00,0.9

Deflation is economically sound for Ethereum,"Some recent comments on this subreddit have suggested that Ethereum should be made inflationary to spur economic activity, so I wanted to give my perspective on why deflation is economically sound for Ethereum.

TL;DR: *Inflation* of a fiat currency erodes savings and *deflation* can bankrupt debtors, slow down economic activity, and lead to unemployment. Central banks balance by targeting a 2 % inflation, keeping some margin for lowering nominal interest rates to 0 % in recessions. For Ethereum, the potential issue with deflation is restricted to slower economic activity. Participants have two attractive choices in the proof-of-stake ecosystem, locking up their tokens for staking or participating in the smart-contract economy. Issuance of new tokens to stakers is the only source of inflation in the system. Inflation can thus be produced by increasing the yield, but this will slow down activity, not increase it, since it incentivizes people to lock up their tokens for staking instead of interacting with smart contracts. A deflationary Ethereum where the burn rate is higher than the issuance rate attracts capital and developers that wish to capture that capital. Thus, deflation is economically sound for Ethereum considering its forthcoming proof-of-stake consensus.

\--------------------------------------------------------

From time to time, it is suggested that cryptocurrencies should be inflationary like fiat currencies so that users are motivated to spend their tokens, not just hold them. It is important to understand the difference between a central bank trying to balance the desire for high employment and low steady inflation of its fiat currency system with that of a proof-of-stake cryptocurrency trying to make its smart-contract economy flourish, maximizing network effects.

Central banks commonly target a 2 % inflation. A too high inflation will erode real wages and savings, lead to rising tensions between social groups and costly periods of disinflation. Periods of deflation on the other hand are often associated with economic crises and bursting bubbles. As demand falls, companies reduce their workforces. Debtors have a hard time paying back their loans denominated in nominal terms and the subsequent defaults remove liquidity, risking a deflationary spiral. Wages would need to fall each year to keep up, but a downward wage rigidity can be expected. In the absence of workers accepting yearly pay cuts, unemployment may rise further. The fact that people can increase their wealth by hoarding cash is also detrimental to economic activity in periods of deflation. Thus, a 2 % inflation target gives central banks some margins down to 0 % so that they can lower nominal interest rates in recessions to spur economic activity, avoid deflation traps, and reduce unemployment.

The realities of proof-of-stake cryptocurrencies like Ethereum are a little different. Deflation causes a rise in the value of the ETH token, but wages are not denominated in ETH and neither are mortgages. Deflation does not bring potential unemployment or spiraling debt burdens. It is rather a fall in price that can be destabilizing, with cascading liquidations among those that lent out their tokens in return for some other form of value, like stablecoins.

The risks of reduced economic activity due to increased wealth from hoarding cash stands out as the most applicable also for Ethereum (hoarding ETH in this case). Certainly, it is desirable with high economic activity and demand. It brings developers to the ecosystem and helps build the network effects that cement Ethereum as the engine of Web3. But now consider the two most interesting options available to token holders in proof-of-stake Ethereum. They may lock up their tokens by staking them, earning yield, or they may use the tokens for economic activity, interacting with smart contracts. Issuance of new tokens to stakers is the only source of inflation in the system. The higher the yield, the higher the inflationary pressure. The higher the yield, the more desirable to lock up tokens instead of participating in the economy. Thus, the relationship between deflation and economic activity is *reversed* in comparison with the fiat economy.

Stakers are a vital part of the ecosystem and should of course be rewarded for their work. But venturing far away from minimum viable issuance to produce inflation will simply constitute a transfer of wealth from those that participate to those that lock up their tokens. Of course, not all forms of ""participation"" may result in high transaction volume. But the mere fact that capital is available and ready to be deployed is arguably important for enticing smart-contract developers to build. If the staking yield is pushed up to produce inflation, the tough competition from the yield of the staking contract discourages development on the chain. It is perhaps not surprising that innovation and economic activity exploded on Ethereum. The promise of an economically sound proof-of-stake consensus in the future in combination with 0 % yield due to proof of work in the short term is an attractive proposition for developers because it produces a lot of capital willing to invest in their DApps. Higher-than-needed staking yield would also force willing participants into a ‚Äúmoney lego‚Äù of staking derivates, which brings systematic risks to any ecosystem of DApps dependent on them. In a deflationary Ethereum, people can hold ETH tokens without seeing their savings eroded and use them for transactions whenever needs in their daily life arise.

Naturally, it would be possible to produce inflation without pushing up the staking yield if the issued tokens could fund some other desirable development. The problem is that public goods funding is very tricky and would undoubtedly lead to friction in the community. Ethereum is not all-encompassing in the same way that fiat money is within a country. Participants can leave the Ethereum economy at any time if they perceive that their holdings are diluted for questionable reasons or projects. This is a good thing. By preserving the value of the token, we attract people to the ecosystem in open competition. Another way to look at this is to recognize that the deflationary pressure comes from high demand for blockspace (via the burn mechanism of EIP-1559) and the inflationary pressure exists to keep the chain secure through issuance. As long as the chain is secure, deflation is a sign of an in-demand protocol.

One last thing in relation to [Gresham's law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gresham%27s_law):  ""bad money drives out good"", which is often quoted in support of inflationary policies. It is important to note that Gresham's law is applicable for two forms of money with different inherent value but where legal-tender laws specifies that they must be exchanged for the same value. This is not applicable for Ethereum, especially considering the fact that competing forms of money in crypto, including ETH, can easily be reacquired on the open market after using it for payment. For all these reasons, I believe that deflation is economically sound for Ethereum.",47.0,2022-02-02 16:33:00,0.86

**Frequently Asked Questions**

**Where's the best place to buy ETH?**

There are many centralized exchanges that support Ethereum. If you live in the US, the most popular exchanges are Coinbase, Gemeni and Kraken. Coinbase users can use Coinbase Pro for lower fees.

**When is Eth2 launching?**

Eth2 is a marketing term used to represent a number of updates to Ethereum. The Eth2 proof-of-stake chain first launched in December 2020. ""The Merge"", which is the event that will fully switch Ethereum's consensus to proof-of-stake, is estimated to be ready in early 2022, although there is no exact timeline. Other updates, such as data shards, will follow that update.

Visit [ethmerge.com](https://ethmerge.com/) to learn more about ""The Merge"".

**Do I need to do anything to update to Eth2? Will Eth2 create a new token?**

No, ETH holders *never* need to take any action to keep holding ETH. Ethereum users will be unaffected by the Eth2 upgrade. And the Eth2 updates will not create any new tokens.

**How can I stake my ETH?**

There are two ways that you can stake your ETH: by running your own validator, or providing your ETH to a staking pool.

* Running your own validator requires a modern computer and 32 ETH. Visit /r/ethstaker for more details
* Staking pools accept any amount of ETH. We recommend [Lido](https://lido.fi/) or [StakeWise](https://stakewise.io/)

**Why are Ethereum transaction fees so high?**

Like most blockchains, Ethereum fees are determined by supply-and-demand. The large demand to use Ethereum has pushed transaction fees quite high (however, fees were just a few cents only 2 years ago). Fees are especially high during market volatility, and during NFT drops.

**What is being done to lower Ethereum transaction fees?**

Ethereum fees are reduced by using layer-2 rollups. Rollups are scaling solutions that allow for significantly cheaper transactions, while still maintaining Ethereum's security.

Additionally, Eth2's data shards will make rollups even cheaper.

While rollups are cutting-edge technology being actively developed, a number are already live on Ethereum mainnet. Visit [l2beat.com](https://l2beat.com/) to learn more about rollups.

**What's the best wallet for Ethereum?**

The most popular tool for using decentralized applications is Metamask. However, for security reasons, we recommend using a hardware wallet such as a Trezor or Ledger.

"A quick reminder of what ""shared security"" means and why it's so important","When evaluating a smaller chain that is somehow ""connected"" to a larger chain, the most important question to ask is this:

**If an attacker can 51% attack the smaller chain, how much damage can they do?**

This is a very realistic and important question to ask, because the smaller chain is very often *much* smaller (in terms of market cap) than the larger chain, and it's often quite feasible for an attacker to actually buy up 51% of the tokens (or at least 51% of the *staking* tokens), especially if there's a large amount of bridged assets parked inside the chain that they could steal.

* If the smaller chain is an **""independent L1""**, they **can steal everything**. They can make a block that illegally edits the state to give them all the coins, and then withdraw the coins through the bridge, and there's no verification happening on the larger chain.
* If the smaller chain is a **""sidechain""**, they **can steal everything**, for the same reason. However, **security** ***can*** **be slightly better** than fully independent L1s, because sidechains whose block headers are published to Ethereum are guaranteed to revert if Ethereum reverts, preventing thefts involving 51% attacks on Ethereum but *not* the sidechain.
* If the smaller chain is a **""rollup""**, they **can delay transactions** and perhaps even force users to pay L1 fees, but they **can't steal anything**. This is because there is an on-chain mechanism (whether fraud proofs or data availability proofs) that can actually check that the events on the smaller chain leading up to the attacker's withdrawal are all valid.

A couple more niche examples:

* If the smaller chain is a **""plasma""**, they **can delay transactions** and force users to pay L1 fees, but they **can't steal anything**.
* If the smaller chain is a **""validium""**, they can **permanently lock up all the users' money** but they **can't steal anything**. Validiums (eg. [Starkware's ImmutableX](https://medium.com/starkware/starkex-now-for-nfts-bfdc9f4655a2)) are thus an interesting middle ground. They are not quite ""true L2s"" to the same extent as rollups are, because someone who takes over the validium can still deny users access to their funds and extort them, but they are nevertheless significantly more secure than sidechains, and importantly they can be as scalable as sidechains.

**This is what we mean by ""shared security"". If you are hodling assets and doing stuff on the smaller chain, are you as secure as if you were doing it on the larger chain, or are you less secure?** On a rollup or a plasma, you are just as secure. On an independent L1 or a sidechain, you are much less secure. On a validium, you're somewhere in the middle.

&#x200B;

|\[--- Platform type ---\]|\[--- Security compared to base chain ---\]|
|:-|:-|
|Independent L1|very much less secure|
|Sidechain|much less secure|
|Validium|somewhat less secure|
|Rollup|just as secure|
|Plasma|just as secure|

Note also that for reasons I described in [this earlier post](https://old.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/rwojtk/ama_we_are_the_efs_research_team_pt_7_07_january/hrngyk8/), a lot of this is actually symmetric: if you are holding ETC, you are better off holding it on a ZK rollup rooted in ETC than you are holding it wrapped on Ethereum (even if the bridge is a perfect ZK-SNARK verifier of Ethereum's consensus). It's not really about being on the biggest chain you can be. It's about the domain your activity is one being part of the same shared security zone as the domain where the assets you're using were originally issued, where a **shared security zone** is defined as ""a chain, and all other chains \[eg. rollups\] whose security is ultimately dependent only on that chain"".

But this doesn't change the above categorization; it only makes it stronger, as these differences in security persist even if Ethereum itself gets 51% attacked.

Some more specific examples:

|\[--- Asset is issued on ---\]|\[--- You are using that asset on ---\]|\[--- Security level ---\]|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Ethereum|Ethereum|High|
|Ethereum Classic|Ethereum Classic|Medium-high|
|Bitcoin SV|Bitcoin SV|Low|
|Ethereum|Avalanche|Low|
|Avalanche|Ethereum|Low|
|Ethereum|StarkEx (rollup mode)|High|
|Ethereum|Arbitrum|High|
|Optimism|Ethereum|High|
|Arbitrum|ZkSync|High|

This is because (Ethereum, Optimism, Arbitrum, ZkSync, StarkEx rollup mode) are in the same shared security zone (as the latter four are all ultimately secured by Ethereum, or at least soon will be when the fraud proof mechanism is fully enabled with all temporary backdoors removed), but Avalanche and Ethereum Classic are not and likely never will be.

BSV is insecure on BSV despite being in the same shared security zone as itself, because BSV is a weak PoW chain that is easily attackable by bored BTC and/or BCH miners and has blocks that are too large for users to verify (with no plans to add sharding/ZK-SNARK/DAS technology to fix this), so someone who 51% attacks BSV can just push invalid blocks through and users would probably have no choice but to accept them.",1626.0,2022-01-30 16:44:11,0.98
[PSA] We should do something for todays HALF MILLION lost tragedy to NEVER EVER happen again.,"[r/Ethereum Today's Headline, The Original Post of Said Tragedy](https://np.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/sfz4kw/did_i_just_lose_half_a_million_dollars_by_sending/)

TL,DR: We should start a campaign, here is our appeal:

1. All wallet software orienting average user, shall ban the action of, or give the scariest warning it can give if the user initiates a tx that directly calls *transfer* function to a Contract address.
2. We should promote and accelerate the deprecation of raw ERC-20, and the wider adoption of newer, more robust and fault-proof ERC-777 and ERC-1555 standards.

No matter what role you are playing in the scene - Blockchain developers, DeFi users, NFT hodlers, investors, today's tragedy is a serious alarm to us all that, Ethereum, along with many other blockchain technologies, are yet to be fully fledged for mass adoption.

This is fully understandable because the nature of new technologies is, no matter how many work we do to make the design perfect, it needs to be tested in the field first for problems to be reveal and fixed.

ERC-20 token standard is one of them, it's such a classic standard with long history and a whole ecosystem built upon it, but we all forgot that the philosophy behind its design is still immature, leading to serious loophole and design failure.

Sending ERC-20 token to any sort of Smart Contract is pointless and exceedingly dangerous. In usual business logic, if user want a certain smart contract to have certain token, what they should do, and the way the Smart Contract should absolutely implement is: user approve in ERC-20 token contract first, then you make user to call a function exposed by your Contract, in the function, your Contract calls *transferFrom* function on ERC-20 Token Contract, so that your contract is aware of this transfer.

An ERC-20 *transfer* function call, to ANY **CONTRACT** ADDRESS, initiated by END-USER (EOA address), is POINTLESS and will ALWAYS result in PERMANENT, UNRECOVEABLE TOKEN LOSS.

Today's tragedy is caused by collective effect of many factor: The nature of Ethereum that all addresses look the same; Lack of user education on smart contract (I see why people blaming [weth.io](https://weth.io) on this, it's fully reasonable, today's victim might came up with the idea him/herself that: hey I send ETH to the contract, got WETH, now I send WETH back, ETH back, that's what the GIF on [weth.io](https://weth.io) says! completely not knowing what's under the hood, the anonymous fallback function and etc.). Lack of on-chain logic checking and preventing this (it would cost everybody's gas).

But the most unforgivable factor is the NEGLIGENCE of wallet software: **ZERO** warning upon sending ERC-20 token to a Contract Address, on the UI I just saw ""Contract interaction: Transfer"", and I'm good to go! To PURGE ALL OF MY HODLING with single mouse click!

That's not how fault tolerance/fault proof should be done - to be honest, that's zero fault proof.

Green across the board, we are good to go right? POOOOF, SNAFU, a poor guy's life saving gone.

This issue has been around for years, and of course, everything on chain is accessible, [etherscan.io](https://etherscan.io) can tell if an address is a contract, Infura can tell if it's a contract. But metamask, ledger live, xxx wallet and etc cannot tell if the address in the text input is a contract.

So, once again in the end, We should start a campaign, here is our appeal:

1. All wallet software orienting average user, shall ban the action of, or give the scariest warning it can give if the user initiates a tx that directly calls *transfer* function to a Contract address.
2. We should promote and accelerate the deprecation of raw ERC-20, and the wider adoption of newer, more robust and fault-proof ERC-777 and ERC-1555 standards.

EDIT 1: My proposal of warning text:

>WARNING!!  
>  
>The recipient address you typed in is a \*Contract address\*.  
>  
>Typically, if you want to give asset to a contract, you should use the dApp of the contract, usually in the form of a website, then follow the instructions there. NOT transferring it here.  
>  
>We do not know if the recipient contract can handle a direct token transfer like what you are trying to do, or not. Usually, if it is an DeFi contract, or a token contract, it does not have the ability.  
>  
>If that's the case and you proceed, ALL ASSET SENT will be PERMANENTLY LOST.  
>  
>there is NO WAY to RECOVER.  
>  
>Are you sure you want to proceed?

1. Cancel.
2. I know what I am doing.
   1. It's my smart wallet. Mark it as my smart wallet address. Proceed.
   2. I'm very sure this is what I want to do. Proceed.

Why the hell are you still on layer one?!,"We're all moving squad, pack your bags, we're heading to the newfoundland of low fees, high security and decentralization.  If you're still making trades or buying NFTs on Layer one, you're burning money.

***ROLLUPS ARE HERE***

Layer 2 rollups are ready today!  Including [Loopring](https://loopring.org/), [zkSync](https://zksync.io/), [Optimistic Ethereum](https://www.optimism.io/), and [Arbitrum](https://bridge.arbitrum.io/).  No more of that sidechain/sister chain business, we can support Ethereum by moving our assets to any of these layer two chains and increasing Liquidity incentives.  The more of us on L2 the better the sandbox becomes.

***FOR THE NEWBIES***

For those of you who are newbies and have never opened a crypto wallet, or those just doing small trades I'd recommend [Loopring Wallet](https://loopring.io/#/wallet) or [Argent Wallet](https://www.argent.xyz/) (powered by zkSync/starknet).  Both of these systems use smart wallets and make holding crypto stupid proof!  When these scaling solutions launch EVM smart contract, anybody will be able to have world class security for less than than a few dollars.

***FOR THE OUT OF THE LOOP CRYPTO VETERANS***

If you're a bit more experienced, have some crypto savings or just want to continue interacting with Dapps, try bridging your funds to [Arbitrum](https://bridge.arbitrum.io/) or [Optimism](https://gateway.optimism.io/)!  Contract calls are roughly around $1 and make trading easy.  They do lack a bit of liquidity, BUT, the more of us that transfer to these L2 solutions, the more incentive there is for liquidity providers to move!

***WE ALL NEED TO MOVE TO L2 IN ORDER TO INCENTIVIZE LIQUIDITY PROVIDERS TO MOVE!***

""*But mrcleansocks, all my funds are on binance and coinbase? how am i supposed to get to layer 2 without touching layer 1 gas fees?""*

**EASY!**

You need to go to [Layerswap](https://www.layerswap.io/)!  They will help you bridge your funds from CEX's to L2s!  No more dirty nasty layer one gas fees to stop you from being your own bank. SO GET ON IT!

On a twitter spaces call between Optimism, Arbitrum, zkSync, and Starknet, they all said that sub 1 cent transactions are coming!  We are on the verge of Layer 2 2022!!!! It's happening! We are scaling!  But we all need to get off layer one!  So get your shit together and let's roll squad, we're building the new world and it's on Layer two now!

I would love to try to find a way to fiat onramp to layer 2.  Despite all the hype, it really doesn't seem to exist.  Polygon?   [Crypto.com](https://Crypto.com) had an awesome announcement - all BS - you have to be on their ""Exchange"" product.  Mt Pelerin's Bridge wallet?

Wait, what's that you say about Polygon?  Yeah, it's a sidechain and I was specifically talking about layer 2.

Potential Merge Release Target: Mid June (This is not a finalized date),"There was a [CL call earlier](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bi2qZ2epaPM) where a potential target for the Merge going live was discussed: Mid June. I wanted to jump ahead of the inevitable misinformation claiming this is a hard-set date.

&#x200B;

**At this point**, there is hope that a V2 of [Kintsugi testnet](https://kintsugi.themerge.dev/) will be released in about 2-3 weeks. From there, client code completion is hoped in March with the a release shortly after of a 'finalized' testnet.  If that testnet goes well, a mainnet launch in June should be doable, getting in front of the currently scheduled difficulty bomb that would render Ethereum useless mid-end July if not delayed.

&#x200B;

# Things to understand:

1. This is an **ESTIMATION** based on the current state and understanding. There is nothing that would prevent further issues to arise that could delay this. It is very possible a severe vulnerability is discovered, a bug requiring re-architecture of certain mechanisms, or many other issues could arise.  If they do arise, there will be open discussions about the impact of those issues and what that means for a main net launch. This does not mean there is a 'Delay', just a better picture of where things are.  
 

2. No individual working on Ethereum should be held accountable for a Mid-June release at this point. That is way too far in advance for anyone to possibly plan for based on the complexity of the codebase and ecosystem. What those individuals should be held accountable for is proper communication of the immediate and near-future work they are doing. If they discover or run into issues, they must, and undoubtedly will, raise all the necessary alarms. \[I am not claiming there has ever been an issue with this\]   


3. Please, for the love of whatever, do not spread that Mid-June is some magic hard-set date of when the Merge will go live. It is, at best, an estimate given how everything stands. People have been giving polls of when they 'think' the Merge will go live but no one has a crystal ball that can foresee every potential issue.

&#x200B;

Everyone is excited about this change, rightly so, and people want it out yesterday, but everyone should want a **Correctly Built Merge** to go live, not the one that happens to exist Mid-June.",89.0,2022-01-27 18:26:14,0.94

A Call To ALL U.S Citizens!!,"So as many of you have heard the ""America Competes Act"" can potentially be problematic for crypto in the U.S. This proposition will allow a sole individual to ban exchanges and other financial institutions from engaging in cryptocurrency transactions. The individual that could potentially hold these unchecked powers is none other than the U.S. Secretary of the Treasury Janet Yellen. The very individual who has be opposed of the crypto market since her confirmation, this is also the same individual who had the brilliant idea to look into bank accounts for possible tax evasion.

It doesn't just stop there, this would allow Yellen to employ what is called the "" Bank Secrecy Act"" to require certain financial institutions to report information around transactions potentially connected to money laundering, as well as prohibit them from serving account holders with such alleged ties to illicit funds. While the act isn‚Äôt something new it would go against the essence of what Defi stands for. While on paper this can be limited to those are under suspicion of money laundering and illicit fund activity we all know how quick this can be used to cover more users and account holders. This can be dangerous considering Yellen would have unilateral power over this sector.

Crypto means something different to every individual in communities like r/ethereum to some a hedge against the current inflation, a means to increase personal wealth, monetary freedom and anonymity, whatever the reason is we are all in this together.

This post is a mere source of information to allow U.S holders to call the respective representatives and let their voices be heard.

If you're are fortunate enough to have a representative to actually consider its constituents views call them!

If you are like me and reside in California you know calling your representatives regarding topics like crypto is like talking to a brick wall, but we must insists our views are represented fairly on what we want. Hammer their phones and emails people!

Thank you for reading, I look forward to discussing this!

What turns me off from Crypto,"I believe ETH and BTC have a great future as a hedge and perhaps even a world currency. My biggest peev is all the rosey self-promotion and Homerism involved in the space. Every crypto site or exchange has 'News' articles and opinion pieces that are overly positive, everything is bullish and the articles are from some friendly website named 'Coin Telegraph' or 'Crypto Potato'. There is not nearly enough critical analysis for something many are dumping half their life savings into. I don't want industry news to be Pravda. Tell me if something is lame, if it has a bad outlook, or if traditional stocks would be better for my situation. Don't blow smoke up my ass.. many of us would be in a better position right now if all these sites and 'news' gurus weren't pushing this ""Bitcoin to 100k"" narrative last yr",36.0,2022-01-26 15:28:43,0.81

**Frequently Asked Questions**

**Where's the best place to buy ETH?**

There are many centralized exchanges that support Ethereum. If you live in the US, the most popular exchanges are Coinbase, Gemeni and Kraken. Coinbase users can use Coinbase Pro for lower fees.

**When is Eth2 launching?**

Eth2 is a marketing term used to represent a number of updates to Ethereum. The Eth2 proof-of-stake chain first launched in December 2020. ""The Merge"", which is the event that will fully switch Ethereum's consensus to proof-of-stake, is estimated to be ready in early 2022, although there is no exact timeline. Other updates, such as data shards, will follow that update.

Visit [ethmerge.com](https://ethmerge.com/) to learn more about ""The Merge"".

**Do I need to do anything to update to Eth2? Will Eth2 create a new token?**

No, ETH holders *never* need to take any action to keep holding ETH. Ethereum users will be unaffected by the Eth2 upgrade. And the Eth2 updates will not create any new tokens.

**How can I stake my ETH?**

There are two ways that you can stake your ETH: by running your own validator, or providing your ETH to a staking pool.

* Running your own validator requires a modern computer and 32 ETH. Visit /r/ethstaker for more details
* Staking pools accept any amount of ETH. We recommend [Lido](https://lido.fi/) or [StakeWise](https://stakewise.io/)

**Why are Ethereum transaction fees so high?**

Like most blockchains, Ethereum fees are determined by supply-and-demand. The large demand to use Ethereum has pushed transaction fees quite high (however, fees were just a few cents only 2 years ago). Fees are especially high during market volatility, and during NFT drops.

**What is being done to lower Ethereum transaction fees?**

Ethereum fees are reduced by using layer-2 rollups. Rollups are scaling solutions that allow for significantly cheaper transactions, while still maintaining Ethereum's security.

Additionally, Eth2's data shards will make rollups even cheaper.

While rollups are cutting-edge technology being actively developed, a number are already live on Ethereum mainnet. Visit [l2beat.com](https://l2beat.com/) to learn more about rollups.

**What's the best wallet for Ethereum?**

The most popular tool for using decentralized applications is Metamask. However, for security reasons, we recommend using a hardware wallet such as a Trezor or Ledger.

Ethereum 2.0 finality time?,"I'm trying to figure out the finality of Ethereum when it is fully upgraded in several years.  After the merge, splurge, verge, surge, all that jazz, when Ethereum's roadmap is fully complete, what will it's finality time be?

With a 6.4 minute epoc time, will we need to wait 2.5 epocs as I've seen before?  I'm wondering what Ethereum's final form will be and if we will still be waiting 15 minutes to consider a transaction final.

I'm extremely bullish on ETH, but if it's finality will never be under 15 minutes, there HAS to be other chains who will thrive with fast finality times.  In my opinion if this is the case, it confirms that the future is multi-chain.  Are there other solutions on Ethereum that I'm not aware of?

This is just the beginning of end of INEQUALITY - do not forget this,"Markets are going down and suddenly a lot of people are panicking. I just want to say one thing: this is the opportunity to fix a broken system where the rich continue to get richer, and the poor get poorer.

In a world where inequality has been increase and the pandemic made things even worse, blockchain could be the solution to this inequality and having a levelled playing field: DeFi for Finance, NFT for art, Metaverses for property.

Financial Institution today are for the rich: The wealthy pay tiny fees and the small savers end up paying high fees.

Same with the art market: it is rigged by the wealthy, who decide who will be the next expensive artist.

Again this holds true for the property market, where increasing prices is making housing increasingly unaffordable for the average Joe.

Cryptos and the technology behind it, could be a unique opportunity to bring back a levelled playing field in this broken system.

ETH coinbase staking tax in thr US,"When I try to do my tax, I downloaded the statement from Coinbase as .csv file.

The first sentence from the csv file:

""You can use this transaction report to inform your likely tax obligations. **For US customers**, Sells, **Converts**, and Rewards Income, and Coinbase Earn transactions are taxable events. For final tax obligations, please consult your tax advisor.""

Then I have this in one of my entry. It appear it used ""Converted 0.1000 ETH to 0.1000 ETH2"". The tax app I used also treated it as a taxable event if I just upload the data. Should I let it be and accept the capital gain or should I fix it manually? I could not find a clear guideline.

A collection of various things the average /r/ethereum browser should know about Ethereum,"So I know it's gonna be very controversial to post a lot of pro-Ethereum stuff in /r/ethereum given all the maxis and ETH killer moonboys who love to spread FUD in every thread. And it's very easy to attack Ethereum when you don't understand what it's trying to be and what it's trying to achieve. So I figured I'd post all the general statements that I and many other have been making over and over for a while now. I'm happy to elaborate on any of them, but please keep the discussion in good faith. I'm also willing to add more points if I forgot some. Some of these are my own opinion, some definitely require more context to understand properly (again, happy to elaborate) but the goal is to quickly summarize all the different stuff that gets brought up over and over.

Anyway yeah, if you're invested in Ethereum, or at the very least interested in it enough to be browsing this sub (why else would you be here lol) then you should be aware of the following:

1. Ethereum is the network, Ether is the currency. And there is no ""I"" anywhere in the name.

2. [Fees are high](https://cryptofees.info/) because that's how much the market values Ethereum's limited blockspace. It's purely supply and demand.
    * Fees scale with [how much computation is being executed](https://docs.ethhub.io/using-ethereum/transactions/), not how much money is being handled. It costs $5 on average to send any amount of Ether, whether it's $1's worth or $1 million's. It costs much more to do swaps and mint NFTs and such because those operations require more computation.
    * There is no way for anyone to artificially keep fees high unless they're willing to [literally burn millions of dollars per day for no reason](https://watchtheburn.com/).

3. Ethereum's blockspace is limited because letting people run nodes themselves on average consumer hardware is important for decentralization.
    * Decentralization is a spectrum and has many meanings from protocol specification, protocol implementation, node distribution, coin distribution, censorship resistance, permissionlessness, etc.
    * Pointing at one aspect to scream ""centralized"" isn't clever nor helpful. Chances are the aspect you point out is known and is an active area of research with a concrete plan on [the roadmap](https://i.imgur.com/vXMaIyZ.png) to address it and increase decentralization some more.
    * No blockchain is ever fully decentralized, especially not from the start ‚Äì and Ethereum's end goal is to be able to run without a hiccup for *decades* if not *centuries*. At 6.5 years old, it's still very young.
    * If you care about decentralization, invest in and contribute to projects like Ethereum who view it as a goal, not a crutch that ""nobody cares about it that much anyway, let's just [increase the gas limit](https://github.com/binance-chain/bsc/issues/553) to have low fees asap""

4. There is a [vast difference](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/nodes-and-clients/#node-types) between an ""archive node"" (several TBs) and a ""full node"" (hundreds of GBs)
    * Running an archive node is not necessary to sync from genesis and verify blocks and transactions.
    * A full node has all the information enough to generate an archive node.
    * There are plans on [the roadmap](https://i.imgur.com/vXMaIyZ.png) to reduce the storage/bandwidth/RAM requirements of nodes even more, to a point where a smartphone will be able to independently verify and propagate new blocks. 

5. There is no ""when eth2 rolls out"" or ""when devs release eth2"" or god forbid ""when ethereum is upgraded to 2.0"". What there is instead is a roadmap consisting of a series of upgrades aiming to help rollups ‚Äì *not the base layer* ‚Äì scale to hundreds of thousands of TPS.
    * Depending on context, Eth1 is usually synonymous with ""execution layer"" and Eth2 usually means ""consensus layers"" ([helpful illustration](https://i.imgur.com/AHHcUgm.png)) otherwise ""eth2"" is an umbrella term for the set of upgrades over a long period of time, but the fact remains that there is no specific instant in time where ""eth1 turns into eth2"".
    * Similarly, there is no ""eth2"" coin. ETH is ETH, you don't have to do anything, the coins you hold today will be the same after the switch to proof of stake.

6. Unlocking staked Ether [will not cause a mass sell-off event](https://twitter.com/domothy/status/1467387422765953029). There is a limited withdrawing queue, it's not gonna happen all at once. And there are many more reasons for more people to start staking Ether than there are for the current stakers to exit en masse.
    * Also, unlocking staked Ether will not be possible directly after the merge. Withdrawals will be enable in the first fork that follows the merge ~6 months later.

7. There are plenty of options to avoid high gas fees, it's perfectly fine to use a sidechain to do your DeFi stuff for now. I use sidechains myself too. Just don't pretend these sidechains will replace Ethereum in any significant way as that's not even what they're trying to do.

8. Switching to Proof of Stake [will not lower Layer 1 gas fees significantly](https://willthemergelowergasprices.org/). Anyone saying otherwise is either misinformed or trying to mislead you into false expectations to bank on the inevitable mass disappointment following the merge.
    * It's still a monumental upgrade that will render possible much-needed upgrades like light clients, statelessness, and sharding, etc. that would otherwise be impossible or impractical to implement on the current proof of work chain.
    * It's basically a way to ""start from scratch"" while keeping the same coin, same users, same dapps, same network effects.
    * PoS has been on the roadmap [since day 1](https://blog.ethereum.org/2015/03/03/ethereum-launch-process/). Yes, estimates of PoS dates have been wrong before. However right now it's all hands on deck on the merge, the spec is done, the beacon chain is running, there is a [merge testnet running](https://blog.ethereum.org/2021/12/20/kintsugi-merge-testnet/), it's happening.

9. Sharding will not lower Layer 1 gas fees significantly either. Sharding is all about *data*, execution on Layer 1 will still be limited and expensive. What data sharding will do is help rollups (Layer 2) scale by several orders of magnitude.

10. [Rollups](https://mirror.xyz/ethmaxitard.eth/iyCAlOexgQKOvoSAAk4utYGEdnESOKb5HstM2_LaqL4) are [already live today](https://l2beat.com/) and they will only [get cheaper](https://l2fees.info/) as more people use them.

11. [Data sharding + rollups is the only sustainable way](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/pk57n7/why_rollups_data_shards_are_the_only_sustainable/) to scale a blockchain globally without compromising decentralization.
    * ""Sustainable"" as in the overall security model doesn't rely on hoping that the coin's price will pump forever to outpace the dilution from the blockchain issuing way more new coins than they collect in fees. Something that all major blockchains (including Ethereum most days, and even Bitcoin) are currently doing.
    * ""Without compromising decentralization"" as in more decentralization = more data for rollups = more scaling (lower individual fees on L2). Decentralization becomes an integral part of the scaling equation rather than a crutch.
    * [The rollup-centric roadmap](https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/a-rollup-centric-ethereum-roadmap/4698) is all about admitting that no single blockchain can do it all by itself and can't compete with what rollups can do. In other words, ""Ethereum maximalism"" amounts to helping independent teams develop rollups, innovate and compete with each other on top of Ethereum's secure, decentralized, and open platform.
    * The true competition of sidechains is rollups, not Ethereum itself. 
    * All the criticisms of a multi-rollup world apply to the current multi-chain world model as well. Except they apply way more to the multi-chain world and can be overcome way more easily in a multi-rollup world.
    * A rollup can settle on any L1, sure, but it's gonna gravitate towards the most secure, most decentralized and most credibly neutral settlement layer with the best data availability. Right now only Bitcoin and Ethereum fit those criteria (other L1s optimize for fast execution, not secure data availability) and Bitcoin would need a hard fork to implement rollup-friendly functions, so that only leaves Ethereum as the poised [""AWS for blockchain""](https://twitter.com/domothy/status/1465905887541972996).

12. Ether isn't meant to be a day-to-day currency that will replace fiat. The use-case of Ether isn't to pay for bread and milk, it's to pay for gas fees and secure the network. All the other use-cases derive from Ether's scarcity, but they're not strictly necessary.
    * Having Ether be an appreciating asset is good for the overall long-term health of the network by providing it with more [economic security, its holders more economic bandwidth](https://i.imgur.com/AErfdod.png), and its users more reasons to hold/stake. The incoming deflation is good.
    * However, the supply is not gonna be deflationary forever. The market dictates how much the blockspace is worth (so how much gets burned) and it also dictates how much the staking APR should be (so how much gets printed) so these two opposing forces will meet in the middle at some point. It's all about [them feedback loops](https://i.imgur.com/3bPV35a.png).

13. The security model trumps the economic model. The core idea behind the economic model is: ""[Minimum viable issuance to secure the network](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/izhkvk/minimum_viable_issuance_why_ethereums_lack_of_a/)"". It was designed from the start to be [disinflationary](https://blog.ethereum.org/2014/04/10/the-issuance-model-in-ethereum/) (as in, inflation % terms goes down over time) with even the idea of fee burning being mentioned in [early](https://blog.ethereum.org/2016/07/27/inflation-transaction-fees-cryptocurrency-monetary-policy/) publications and [FAQ](https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/Proof-of-Stake-FAQ/ba766606790d80422b23650d3326e2d963bdfa87)

14. It's okay to change or tweak things when new research indicates there's a problem with long-term sustainability or security of the current model. These changes don't happen ""on a whim of a few people"", there's a lot of consideration that go into them.
    * And remember, changes happen in a highly adversarial context. If there's *any* possibility of an upgrade causing security problems or being exploited in any way for profit, then it *will* happen. Changes don't just happen for fun ""just because"", they happen when their benefits outweigh the inherent risks of potentially adding more complexity.

15. The Ethereum Foundation is more of a [coordinator than a dictator](https://ethereum.foundation/philosophy/). It's much more of a community-focused bottom-up approach than the top-down structure people think.
    * Everything happens extremely transparently on open forums that no one reads and [public livestream calls](https://www.youtube.com/c/EthereumFoundation/videos) that no one listens to. But everyone who wants to participate is welcome, it's all out in the open.
    * The Ethereum Foundation doesn't code any of the actual software, client teams do. There are 5 major execution clients and 4 major consensus clients, developed by independent teams, to implement the protocol specification. This multi-client approach may be responsible for development delays, but it comes with [security benefits](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/mreacw/psa_the_importance_of_multiclient_and_why_the/)
    * [Anyone can propose an Ethereum Improvement Proposal](https://ethereum.org/en/eips/). You just have to convince others it's a good idea to implement it (most EIPs don't get implemented and fall into obscurity) and the clients could just refuse to code it in if it's a very bad idea. The more time passes, the harder it becomes to push changes to the Ethereum protocol and everything converges to the status quo. (This doesn't close the door to further innovation however, as it's still an open platform on which anyone can build)
    * Vitalik regularly gets his proposals blocked by client teams, other researchers, or the community in general. At most, he's a knowledgeable influence because he knows the tech and cryptography in depth and has been there from the beginning. It's silly to worship him, and it's silly to treat him as Ethereum's Zucc-like CEO. He's ""just some guy"".

16. The ""[DAO hard fork](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-779)"" wasn't a roll-back. Not a single transaction was reverted, no one lost any funds other than the exploiter who could have otherwise gotten away with [15% of the total supply at the time](https://www.coindesk.com/learn/2016/06/25/understanding-the-dao-attack/). It wasn't a bailout of Vitalik and his pals, it was a bailout of a huge chunk of the community from an event that could have killed the whole thing in its infancy. 
    * In the end it's all social consensus, and the consensus from miners, users, developers was strong. Even ""code is law"" is social consensus that [can get reverted in case of major bugs](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Value_overflow_incident). It's all about what the community deems [legitimate](https://vitalik.ca/general/2021/03/23/legitimacy.html).
    * *edit: see comments for more nuance on this point*

17. As far as the [initial distribution](https://i.imgur.com/k3GB8Lh.png) goes, Ethereum's ICO is among [the best of those who had an ICO](https://i.imgur.com/fmW3ytf.png), and as far as the current distribution goes (after 6 years of proof of work and market movements), it's [on par with Bitcoin's](https://medium.com/@adamscochran/the-10k-audit-42c100dd32bb). 60m of the 72m ""pre-mined"" coins went to a permissionless no-KYC sale, and [all the genesis transactions are included in Block #0](https://etherscan.io/txs?block=0) so you can check yourself that there's no hidden coins. Just like Bitcoin, early investors took on big risks and got big rewards. No surprises here. Any concerns of the ICO being a scam or rugpull should have vanished some time in 2015, yet here we are still talking about it for some reason.
    * And if coin distribution is a concern to you because proof of stake, then you should be glad the DAO hack didn't end up with a single person owning 15% of the supply...
    * *edit: see comments for more nuance on this point too lol*

18. There is no ""technical debt"" preventing Ethereum from scaling.

19. EIP-1559 was [not meant to lower gas fees](https://web.archive.org/web/20210205013340/https://willeip1559lowergasprices.org/) and no credible person ever promised it was a scaling solution.
    * It has [many benefits](https://domothy.com/eip1559/) beyond coin burning. The deflation is a nice side effect, and it's certainly not a gimmick meant to pump the price.

20. Proof of Work is really just Proof of Stake with extra steps.
    * In both systems, the goal is reach consensus in a sybil-resistant way. Spending time and energy by computing hashes over and over is just the easiest way to reach that goal. But if we can achieve that goal (randomness + verifiable delay functions) without using the energy of a continent, maybe we should look into it.
    * In both systems, whoever has capital gets to earn more capital by producing more blocks. (Except in Proof of Stake, everyone earns at the same rate, proportional to how much they stake)
    * In both systems, the capital that someone has at stake (mining rigs vs coins directly) is a good indicative that they will play by the rules.
    * By design, [Ethereum doesn't have on-chain governance](https://docs.ethhub.io/ethereum-basics/governance/#on-chain-governance). This means that the people with the most coins can't change the rules under PoS any more than the people with the most hash rate can change the rules under PoW.
    * Just like there are mining pools, there are staking pools. As usual, some options are [more decentralized and community-focused](https://rocketpool.net/) than others.",1065.0,2022-01-20 16:21:08,0.99

How Will L2 affect ETH Supply?,"Im sure this has been answered often but:

ETH is deflationary, and soon L2's will be where everything is done. When you use Polygon, do you pay the feee in ETH or Poly? Same goes for other potential chains if they make their own coin(Arbi/Opti).

If the fee is paid in their own coin, then the burn rate will be much lower than what we think right now? Or when the fees greatly drop + no fees are paid in ETH, how will that work out.

Basically, when you use L2, will it reduce the burn of ETH or are the fees still paid in ETH regardless",27.0,2022-01-18 13:09:49,0.93

"How Reddit (Web2) is pushing the Development of Web3, Web2.5?","One of the biggest social media platform - Reddit which is incorporated company/ Centralized, is pushing the adoption of Web3 via [Reddit Community Points](https://www.reddit.com/community-points).

These Community Points are ERC20 tokens based on Reddit Arbitrum network( Layer 1 = Rinkeby testnet, Layer 2 = Reddit Arbitrum), Currently they are on testnet but Reddit is working to migrate them into Ethereum Mainnet - once their scaling solution is done. 

These tokens can be used to vote on governance polls, buy premium memberships, convert to Reddit coins, tipping between users and we saw a leak last week showing that there is a chance that these points will be used to buy ads space on the subreddits. 

Currently r/Cryptocurrency MOONs üåô 
And r/FortniteBR BRICKs üß± are the only tokens on Reddit with marketcap of $10M and $1.5M respectively, pretty impressive for a testnet tokens.

There are about 150k MOONs and 75k BRICKs  users, most likely we will see massive increase in users on mainnet (only 3.5% of the subreddit members are using MOONs).

Currently https://RCPswap.com (Reddit Community Points Swap - AMM DEX on Reddit Arbitrum developed by me and other dev) is under development, soon it will have a stablecoin.

**Why it‚Äôs important?**
~430,000,000 monthly Redditors can potentially be new Web3 users (430M users are getting Ethereum wallet and exposure to the Defi world), this is mass adoption and should make a difference on Web3 adoption when this project gets officially launched on Mainnet.

**Number of Cryptocurrency users around the world 220M, Reddit can potentially triple that!**

For me it‚Äôs interesting to see how Web2 companies are trying to stay relevant:
Reddit with Reddit Community Points,
Twitter with Bitcoin adoption and
Facebook with Metaverse.

Could Circle freeze USDC on any wallet address just like Tether did to USDT?,"Recently [Tether froze 160m USDT](https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2022/01/13/tether-freezes-160m-of-usdt-stablecoin-on-ethereum-blockchain/) on Ethereum. This makes me questioning about the censorship risk of stable tokens issued by centralized entities.

USDC by Circle, BUSD/USDP by Paxos, WBTC by BitGo, etc. Do these tokens can be freezed by the issuers?

How about partially-usdc-backed stablecoins issued by DAOs like DAI by MakerDAO and FRAX by FraxDAO? What will happen if Circle freezes USDC held by those DAOs?

Which stabletoken is truly decentralized? Algorithmic stablecoin on other chain like UST by Terra and cUSD by Celo may have unreliable collateral. sUSD by Synthetix is also collateralized by SNX which may has similar reliability to Terra and Celo.

So, does the truly decentralized stablecoin must only use ETH as collateral? If that's so, then so far as I know, the choice is RAI by Reflexer and LUSD by Liquity. RAI is unpegged while LUSD is pegged to USD. I might just pick both 50/50 as my stable holdings, but RAI is issued by Reflexer Labs which is based in the US, is that a risk?

To be clear, I'm not trying to shill any token/protocol here. I want to find a stablecoin which is the most decentralized stablecoin available rn bc currently I hold tens percent of multiple stablecoins. Can't imagine if those funds are frozen",76.0,2022-01-16 12:07:34,0.95

Exploring the Ecosystem 1: High-level L2 Overview,"Hello /r/Ethereum,

This is going to be the first in hopefully a long line of informational posts about the Ethereum ecosystem. I‚Äôm not planning much rhyme or reason to what I cover, but with each post I hope to give a general introduction to the topic at hand and provide a springboard from which a reader can begin additional research. I want to be relatively unbiased in my research and I‚Äôll strive for correctness, but if you see something glaringly wrong please call it out so I can correct the record. The overall goal is not to do an exhaustive ‚Äúdeep dive‚Äù into a specific topic but rather to provide an introductory overview so that the reader is equipped to do additional research if they choose. 

So let‚Äôs get into the first topic: 

**High-level L2 Ecosystem Overview**

You‚Äôve probably heard about ‚ÄúL2‚Äù by now; it‚Äôs Ethereum‚Äôs solution to the blockchain trilemma. Rather than try to do everything on mainnet, new cryptography concepts have enabled the off-loading of transaction execution to secondary networks called rollups. These secondary networks will be able to ‚Äúinherit‚Äù the security of Ethereum mainnet while bundling thousands of transactions together for drastic fee savings.

For more on the details and theory behind rollups, check out Polynya‚Äôs blog: https://polynya.medium.com/ 

But enough about theory- what rollups exist today? What differentiates them? What risks are there? 

First, some useful resources:

https://l2fees.info/ - A simple overview of what some common actions cost on several rollups compared to Ethereum mainnet

https://l2beat.com/ - An incredibly useful site aggregating all sorts of up-to-date information about layer-2s

https://defillama.com/chains ‚Äì Statistics aggregator for DeFi. Great for comparing TVL between chains and rollups.

[ethl2s.com](https://mirror.xyz/ethmaxitard.eth/iyCAlOexgQKOvoSAAk4utYGEdnESOKb5HstM2_LaqL4) -  Quick reference for all sorts of L2 information including fiat onramps, bridges, wallets, and apps. 

Now, the major players in the rollup space:

* [Arbitrum](https://portal.arbitrum.one/) ‚Äì The largest rollup by TVL and by number of deployed dApps. Arbitrum uses fraud proofs for security, and usage is very similar to mainnet. Currently centralized and does have admin keys during beta. Fees are a few dollars.
* [StarkWare](https://starkware.co/) ‚Äì Creators of StarkNet and StarkEx. StarkNet is their general-purpose rollup which is currently in mainnet alpha and only has ‚Äútest‚Äù apps right now. StarkEx is the rollup tech powering dYdX, ImmutableX, DeversiFi, and Sorare. Uses validity proofs for security, and each StarkEx app has different security attributes. StarkEx apps have over a billion dollars in combined TVL, easily the 2nd largest rollup by that measurement.
* [Optimism](https://gateway.optimism.io/) ‚Äì Arbitrum‚Äôs main fraud proof competitor. Usage is again very similar to mainnet and has a decent number of deployed apps. Currently centralized with admin keys and the fraud proofs are not yet operational. Has been un-whitelisted since December 2021, and fees are a bit lower than Arbitrum‚Äôs. 
* [Loopring](https://loopring.io/#/) ‚Äì Everyone has probably heard of LRC by now, but you might not know that it was the first operational validity proof rollup! LRC has been operational for well over a year now and recently launched their L2 smart wallet app. They‚Äôre one of the few rollups with a token right now. Loopring has fairly good security, their main flaw is that there is no delay on code updates; they do have an operational ‚Äúescape hatch‚Äù however. Fees are generally under $1 for transfers. 
* [Metis Andromeda](https://www.metis.io/ecosystem-partners/) ‚Äì A fork of Optimism, Metis has set out to be a home for DAOs so that they can more seamlessly cooperate with each other and with the broader digital economy. They currently share all of the drawbacks of Optimism, although there is a METIS token available. 
* [Boba Network](https://boba.network/ecosystem/) ‚Äì Another optimistic rollup made with forked code from Optimism, Boba is built by the Enya team at the OMG foundation. They share the same vulnerabilities as the other Optimism forks, and like Metis they do have a token (BOBA). It‚Äôs still relatively early days for Boba, and it remains to be seen how well they stack up against competitors since they‚Äôre also aiming to be a general-purpose L2. 
* [ZKSwap](https://www.zks.org/) ‚Äì Similar to Loopring, ZKSwap is designed to be a validity-proof-based L2 DEX with transfers and an NFT marketplace. There are subtle differences in the tech design of ZKSwap vs. Loopring which I won‚Äôt get into here. ZKSwap does have an 8-day delay on updates and an operational escape hatch function, and it also has a token (ZKS). Edit: As the comments point out, ZKSwap is a direct fork of zkSync. 
* [zkSync](https://zksync.io/) ‚Äì Created by Matter Labs, zkSync is aiming to be a major player in the zkEVM space. Their current product ‚ÄúzkSync 1.0‚Äù is available today with transfers/trades and limited NFT functionality, but 2.0 is in testnet which is aiming to have full EVM compatibility. ZkSync is arguably one of the safest rollups currently with a 14-day delay on code updates and an operational escape hatch should the operator go down. There is currently no token, although zkSync has confirmed that they intend to move to community governance in the future. Fees are generally under $1 for transfers. 
* [Aztec](https://zk.money/) ‚Äì Also known as zk.money, Aztec is the only operational rollup aiming to be a privacy network. Currently zk.money 1.0 is live and available for ‚Äúshielding‚Äù transactions, and they plan to launch 2.0 in 2022 along with ‚Äúdecentralization‚Äù. If they‚Äôre able to achieve EVM compatibility, you could essentially have monero-like privacy while using Ethereum-based assets and apps. They currently have some of the strongest rollup security with zk.money 1.0, although it is limited to simple payments. 
* [Polygon](https://polygon.technology/get-started/) ‚Äì Everybody knows about the MATIC sidechain (commit-chain?) but you might not know that Polygon is also a tech leader in the zk-rollup space. They‚Äôve acquired several cutting-edge teams and are developing several projects such as Miden, Nightfall, Zero, and Hermez. Their operational zk rollup product is Hermez, which only performs simple payments at the moment and has some compromises in terms of security. It‚Äôs unclear whether the MATIC token will have a role to play in the rollup economy, but Polygon itself is likely to be around for a long time as they‚Äôve developed important tech in the space.

Hopefully I‚Äôve given each major rollup a fair summary. I highly recommend reading the information on l2beat.com to understand where each rollup stands in terms of adoption and security. If you‚Äôd like to try one out, evaluate your own security needs relative to the value of your investment, and proceed accordingly. If you find an ecosystem you enjoy, pay close attention to it! New things are happening nearly every day in this space and staying abreast of all the updates is like drinking from a firehose. 

If you have questions, comments, or concerns please leave a comment and I‚Äôll be happy to expand on what I‚Äôve written.",39.0,2022-01-14 13:40:38,0.9

This is Justin Maher, a well known scammer in the crypto/defi world specifically erc20 making their way to bnb. Along with Russ Davis, they launch projects they then send out as picks. They pretend not to know developers, but have doxxed them and vouch. They have tokenomiks with ""eth reflections"" usually have a dApp on their website, to connect your wallet and claim. This is a great way for them to make tons of money quickly themselves. This is partially the main reason why you'll see the uniswap router dump tons of amounts of eth in their projects also. The excuse when the dump/rugs happen is usually ""the devs ran off"" Or ""lost the keys."" Then they move on to a new project, Don't be fooled by their locked liquidity tactics either because they use ""presale"" to stock up on coins as well as other methods like sniping their own project. Don't be fooled by a large quantity of holders, they airdrop thousands of people to fluff numbers and use tons of bots for telegram subscribers. They can afford to do anything as they've scammed for millions of dollars. They've launched many different projects, from ACCEL, Ascend token, Shunav1,Shuna v2, levelup, weGrow, boombabyio, to matrix samurai, peeps, Bezoge, Arena, HODL, fkemax, viceX and many many others. Serenity is coming up, another scam. The owner, justin Maher has been served by the sec, resigned from northwestern mutual as an financial advisor, and caused all of Ethereummax's issues being the founder that took part in the launch and obtained hundreds of trillions of tokens at that time. I really want to help make this world a better place and stop people like this from destroying the industry. They have many moderators they pay in tokens that will pretend they're fans of these projects, even after they rug. I'm shocked they never get upset. Justin Maher is a master manipulator and I have fell for his lies many times, but Accel was the last lie I'll fall for. I've learned my lesson in the erc20 world thanks to people like Justin Maher and Russ Davis (inRussWetrust crypto group on facebook), I quickly learned in Russ we don't trust...

It‚Äôs time to stop using seed phrases. Do you agree?,"I know, you are probably thinking, *""What the f\*ck are you talking about? How am I supposed to recover my non-custodial wallet without a seed phrase?""*

Let me explain‚Ä¶

We all agree that getting a non-custodial wallet is the safest way to store cryptos. Not your keys, not your crypto, right?

What I totally disagree though, is using a seed phrase as the only means to recover our non-custodial wallets.

The reason is simple.

People keep losing their seed phrase and getting scammed every day. 

You might think, ""It's their fault for being dumb. Not our business.""

Well, this is not the case. It is absolutely our business.

If we really want cryptos to grow and be adopted by everyone, we need an easier way for people to own their digital assets. 

Furthermore, while you might have not compromised your seed phrase yet, the risk of phishing and losing it is extremely high even for experienced users.

Vitalik Buterin himself wrote a piece on this, titled ""Why we need wide adoption of social recovery wallets.""

In it, he explains that we need a wallet that is easy to use and that has no single point of failure (there is no single thing that, if stolen, can give an attacker access to your funds, or if lost, can deny you access to your funds.) 

At Linen Wallet, we've built exactly this type of non-custodial wallet. A wallet that is both safer and easier than standard self-custody wallets. Here's how it works:

* No single point of failure: Using a smart contract, the wallet is secured with 3 keys, 2 of which are required to make a transaction. You lose one? You can still access your wallet. Someone steals one? They still can't access it.
* Simple keys management: One key is stored in your cloud, one in your mobile device, and one in Linen's secure server infrastructure. (More options will be available in future versions)
* No seed phrase: You can seamlessly recover your wallet using your cloud drive, email, and phone number.

We strongly believe that this setup is both safer and easier, allowing a greater adoption of cryptos. But I'd LOVE to hear from the crypto community and see if you value what we are doing. So please, ask me anything in the comment!

ZK Technology comparison: ZK-Snarks (Loopring) vs ZK-Starks (Starkware),"First of all why do we focus on ZK Technologies?

Because Vitaliks said so:  


>In general, my own view is that in the short term, optimistic rollups are likely to win out for general-purpose EVM computation and ZK rollups are likely to win out for simple payments, exchange and other application-specific use cases, **but in the medium to long term ZK rollups will win out in all use cases as ZK-SNARK technology improves**.

**What does ZK mean?**

**Defintion:**  
In cryptography, a **zero-knowledge proof** or **zero-knowledge protocol** is a method by which one party (the prover) can prove to another party (the verifier) that a given statement is true while the prover avoids conveying any additional information apart from the fact that the statement is indeed true.

**ZK = Scaling + Privacy**  
They are both a privacy enhancing technology, as they reduce the amount of information that needs to be provided between users, and a scaling technology, since they can allow proofs to be verified at a faster rate because they don‚Äôt contain the full amount of information for non-private systems.¬†

**BUT...**

Newer ZK Technologies like ZK Starks are out!  
The general consensus is that they are better than ZK Snarks.  
Because of that I would like to keep an open mind and compare both technologies.

# ZK-SNARK

Stands for zero-knowledge succinct **non-interactive** argument of knowledge.  
First paper in 2012.  
ZK-SNARKs at their base depend upon elliptic curves for their security.

**Protocols:**

* Loopring
* Polygon Hermez
* ZKSync
* ZKSwap

**Pros:**  
\+ Smaller proof size  
\+ Smaller verification time  
\+ Bigger developer community and libraries (longer in the game)

**Cons:**  
\- Require trusted setup (honest participants needed)  
\- Longer prover time  
\- Not secure by quantum computers  
\- Stong crypto assumptions  
*(The weaker the assumptions of a model, the stronger the model. Relaxing an assumption is to go from a strong to a weak, more realistic, assumption.)*

# ZK-STARK

Stands for zero-knowledge scalable **transparent** argument of knowledge.  
First paper in 2018.  
STARKs rely on hash functions.

**Protocols:**

* Starkware/StarkEx
* Immutable X (StarkEx)
* DYDX (StarkEx)
* Starknet
* Polygon Miden

**Pros:**  
\+ Quantum resistant  
\+ Assumptions: Collision resistant hashes (less likely to be attacked)  
\+ No trusted setup required  
\+ Vocal support from Ethereum foundation  
\+ More scalable in terms of computational speed

**Cons:**  
\- Far larger proof size = more gas  
\- Small developer community because it is new

Below, we have a couple tables depicting some of the high-level differences between the two technologies.

# Lessons to learn:

While ZK Snark are currently more popular and also mentioned by Vitalik I would like to suggest everyone to keep an open mind about other technologies.

ZK Starks do not need a trusted setup and are generally more secure.  
On the downside the verfication cost is orders of magnitudes higher!!  
Currently this is the killer but if the verfication cost can be reduced

......ZK Starks can be very serious competition.

**Now who uses what?**

l2beat.com gives an good overview of all relevant L2's.

* **ZK Stark protocols are marked in blue** (all use Starkware)*Starkware uses Volition: This is a hybrid of ZK Rollups and Validiums. This gives the user the freedom to chose the technology based on their preference. (Cost, Security, Scalability)*

**Frequently Asked Questions**

**Where's the best place to buy ETH?**

There are many centralized exchanges that support Ethereum. If you live in the US, the most popular exchanges are Coinbase, Gemeni and Kraken. Coinbase users can use Coinbase Pro for lower fees.

**When is Eth2 launching?**

Eth2 is a marketing term used to represent a number of updates to Ethereum. The Eth2 proof-of-stake chain first launched in December 2020. ""The Merge"", which is the event that will fully switch Ethereum's consensus to proof-of-stake, is estimated to be ready in early 2022, although there is no exact timeline. Other updates, such as data shards, will follow that update.

Visit [ethmerge.com](https://ethmerge.com/) to learn more about ""The Merge"".

**Do I need to do anything to update to Eth2? Will Eth2 create a new token?**

No, ETH holders *never* need to take any action to keep holding ETH. Ethereum users will be unaffected by the Eth2 upgrade. And the Eth2 updates will not create any new tokens.

**How can I stake my ETH?**

There are two ways that you can stake your ETH: by running your own validator, or providing your ETH to a staking pool.

* Running your own validator requires a modern computer and 32 ETH. Visit /r/ethstaker for more details
* Staking pools accept any amount of ETH. We recommend [Lido](https://lido.fi/) or [StakeWise](https://stakewise.io/)

**Why are Ethereum transaction fees so high?**

Like most blockchains, Ethereum fees are determined by supply-and-demand. The large demand to use Ethereum has pushed transaction fees quite high (however, fees were just a few cents only 2 years ago). Fees are especially high during market volatility, and during NFT drops.

**What is being done to lower Ethereum transaction fees?**

Ethereum fees are reduced by using layer-2 rollups. Rollups are scaling solutions that allow for significantly cheaper transactions, while still maintaining Ethereum's security.

Additionally, Eth2's data shards will make rollups even cheaper.

While rollups are cutting-edge technology being actively developed, a number are already live on Ethereum mainnet. Visit [l2beat.com](https://l2beat.com/) to learn more about rollups.

**What's the best wallet for Ethereum?**

The most popular tool for using decentralized applications is Metamask. However, for security reasons, we recommend using a hardware wallet such as a Trezor or Ledger.

so tired of NFT‚Äôs,"is anyone else getting really tired of these money grubbing NFT maxis? I swear everywhere I look there‚Äôs new projects or people flexing their collections and exuberant wealth (which they arguably did nothing to gain other than let celebs or newcomers pump their floor prices). Honestly in all of my years in crypto, despite having been involved in probably 100+ unique projects/tokens/ecosystems - I‚Äôve never seen such toxic people as the NFT maxi communities. It‚Äôs like each one is a little annoying cult and all they want to do is remind everyone else of how much money they have and how valuable their ‚Äúcollections‚Äù are. Tbh it gives NFT‚Äôs and crypto a bad name in my book. 

Meanwhile Avalanche is partnering with Deloitte to provide emergency disaster insurance - and Chainlink has integrated their oracles to be used by farmers for smart contract-based disaster insurance. These are the use cases that can and are going to actually change the world - and yet these NFT maximalists are the ones hogging the spotlight (and congesting networks) all in the name of wanting to get rich and flex to everyone how smart they are and how they‚Äôve mastered the art of trading because they got lucky buying a jpeg. I swear we‚Äôre going to have a wave of people claiming to be professional crypto consultants purely because they got lucky over borderline Ponzi schemes. I am welcoming a crypto winter at this point just to see these annoying groups crash

EDIT: Yeah I‚Äôm talking about purely ‚Äúdigital art‚Äù NFT‚Äôs where it‚Äôs jpegs being hosted on a (not even decentralized) server or marketplace account. Like worthless PFP projects. I have no doubt NFT‚Äôs of insurance policies (I.e. my Avalanche/Deloitte example) will be the future.

ELI5: Multidimensional EIP-1559 (vitalik's new proposal),"I tried to read vitalik's new fee structure that's been circulating lately ([https://ethresear.ch/t/multidimensional-eip-1559/11651](https://ethresear.ch/t/multidimensional-eip-1559/11651)), but I get lost very quickly.

web3 censorship,"So I'm late coming to the blockchain party but I've been doing a deep, comprehensive dive over the past month or so from the perspective of a developer. I find it all fascinating and definitely see the paradigm shifting nature of a decentralized web3, especially when it comes to disrupting the tech and financial giants that dominate so much of the global economy. Good on all of that.

Here's the issue I'm running into: Last night I finally got around to checking out [mirrror.xyz](https://mirrror.xyz). A decentralized blog, something great in the face of totalitarian censorship. It made me think about the Chinese woman who a few years ago posted some bombshell article or accusation onto the blockchain so it could not be censored. I forget the details but that's a fantastic use case for a decentralized publishing platform. I dug into the details of [mirror.xyz](https://mirror.xyz) to learn exactly how much of the site is decentralized versus blockchain-enabled. (See [Moxie Marlinspike's blog entry](https://moxie.org/2022/01/07/web3-first-impressions.html).) This is where I learned how [mirror.xyz](https://mirror.xyz) uses Arweave to store its data, a truly decentralized and uncensorable data solution. (My first look into web3 data storage.)

Awesome. But I see problems with an uncensorable future because there are definitely instances of censorship that the *vast* majority of people support: child porn, violence/torture, blackmail. Tech companies expend a huge amount of effort in conducting this censorship. Hell, even this subreddit includes a form of censorship assuming the moderators ever take an active role in curating the community.

I appreciate the desire for freedom of expression when it comes to politics and culture so let's table that debate and agree to a completely uncensored discourse. But it doesn't take much to go down the dark road of content that makes one cringe at the ability to inject something into the public record that can never be taken down and is freely accessible by anyone looking to connect to it and broadcast it.

Again, I'm new in my exploration of web3 but I haven't read much discussion about how to address this issue. The best I've seen is that KYC will prevent people from posting things they won't want to have connected to them. But that strikes me as a form of disingenuous hand waving when privacy and anonymity is so often held up as a virtue of web3. And regardless, KYC has to be chosen and implemented by the file storage provider. Or is this even true? If it's a decentralized storage blockchain, can't one just submit a transaction with the offending content and be done with it? Even if not, how long until there's a 100% privacy ensured storage option created that allows unfettered posting  of content.

Happy to learn what I'm missing.",22.0,2022-01-08 21:51:57,0.87

Smart contract wallet may be the key to mass adoption,"Bc Argent has this features:
* No awkward seed phrase
* L2 by default (zkSync)
* Fiat-on-ramp
* Username
* Simple UI

Currently defi protocol Curve and Unisync (fork of uniswap v2) are live on ZkSync testnet. Matterlabs also has a roadmap to enable privacy on ZkSync

Basically Argent is the DeFi version of PayPal but more secure, permissionless, trustless, with a flat-transparent-crystal-clear-innocent fee

If there's another Smart Contract Wallet built on L2 and you can bridge funds to ZkSync, then I guess it's just like sending money from Paypal to Cashapp/Venmo/Square

Last but not least, according to L2fees, current tx fee on ZkSync is only $0.42, which is still more expensive than other alt L1, but already much more cheaper than most of international/domestc tx on TradFi

Western Union: $5 to 70 (Depends on tx amount, finalized in minutes)

Reminder: Crypto is Not Here To Make You RICH. Crypto is Here To Make You FREE," **Introduction: Opportunity for Wealth in the Cryptoverse**

Nowhere else on Earth will you find similar types of gains in the cryptoverse. It is a fact, that the opportunity for wealth here is so immense that it creates dreams of unprecedented wealth even for those with a common life. Combine this with explosive price actions and hype, lots of attention and adoption are drawn into the space on a regular basis, making it one of the fastest-growing sectors in the entire human existence.

However, while everybody thinks crypto is the go-to place to make millions, it is also where entire financial life and fortune are ruined and lost. As a nascent space, crypto is warned with a lot of risks, even in a bull market, yet it is intriguing to see people pilling themselves up, thinking this is the only opportunity to escape the rat race and hence better their life. This kind of mentality does make me wonder what the hell is wrong with the current world we are all living in.

&#x200B;

**The Reality of The Current System**

The truth is you can‚Äôt blame them. In the legacy system, so much wrongs are to be found that clouded their ability to judge and search for opportunities. People are enslaved to the system, both in the physical and in the digital world. They live most of their life in accordance to the work and spend cycle, conforming and following the exact same path of life as everybody else under the promise of security and happiness. In exchange, they have to give up their freedom to those who stay in the highest positions of power.

Either by forces or by influences, every human society trends toward a structure with a few in control of the majority. While this is natural to the existence of human beings, it is also what creates much of the sufferings and injustice we see throughout all human history. Being power-hungry and driven creatures, we form hierarchical structures to ensure the best cooperation between each other, yet when societies and networks expand beyond our consciousness, power tends to overconcentrate in entities that then often become corrupted, oppressive and unaccountable.

&#x200B;

**Centralization of Power and Human Nature**

Reflecting on this, we can see the same presence in some of the strongest nations in the world today. When power is abused by a centralized entity, someone must suffer. If not those at the top, the price will have to be paid by those at the bottom, and this is often the case. We see this time and time over again, with the final fate of most society leading towards intolerance, civil war and eventually the collapse of the entire system.

The same can be said to the digital society today, though the difference is those in positions of power are untouchable and divine. They play the role of Gods, influencing the lives of millions and billions each year without us having a voice-over, yet we all have come to accept it because we have no other choice.

Despite all of these, people are still chasing the same damn things that make them slaves in the old system. Thinking by somehow riching off from crypto or any new innovation will make them more free and live more comfortably. This is only a delusion painted by the lies of consumerism and power-hungry culture. In a centralized system, you are neither free nor rich, you are either the few powerful or the majority powerless.

&#x200B;

**Faith in The New System**

Understanding this is the first step in understanding why the world of crypto is so disruptive and why the opportunity for wealth here is so real. Wealth does not magically exist. It comes with and from people who came collectively with the same mindset, same vision and set out to do the same goal: to make a difference in the world, to build something that breaks away from the power structure of the legacy system and to create a place where fairness and freedom lie at the heart of the system.

Crypto was never made to make you RICH. Crypto was made to make you FREE. This is the vision of Satoshi for what a decentralized, trustless, permissionless and censorship-resistant system would bring to the future of humanity: A world where we all have a choice, to either give away control of our life to someone else or be the one who dictates our own fate.

Many of us realized we do not need banks, institutions and corporations to be our responsible. Many of us realized we do not need centralized entities to tell us what to do and what not to do with our life. Many of us realized that we can decide things for ourselves, and that is something we are not offered in the current system. With crypto, we have A CHOICE, and as there exists a demand for having this choice, the market responds with growth and opportunity to where it is offered.

&#x200B;

**Becoming Successful In The Cryptoverse**

Understanding this is crucial to becoming successful in the space. Those who do not stick around will never win big or win at all because their minds are still plugged into the old system. The biggest winners of the space are those who understand the value proposition and turn themselves to this beautiful vision and dedicate their lives to make it a reality either through long-term capitals, through their voices and their words or through their own hands.

Without courage, there is no freedom. Without freedom, there is no opportunity. What is offered as protection in the centralized world is in disguise of restriction, to limit the rate of innovation and revolution that are happening through crypto. They will doubt our success and they will question our authenticity to change the world. But we show them why we are better and why we had to be better, and by believing and dedicating to this space, we ultimately win by bringing equal opportunities to all human beings, while expanding the potentials of human kinds instead of limiting them like in the legacy system.

&#x200B;

**TLDR: Conclusion**

Those who understand the purpose of the cryptoverse will ultimately understand the opportunity for wealth that comes with it. And for as long as we, the people, come together to push it into existence, crypto will not be a single opportunity but an opportunity of a lifetime for all of us human beings. Crypto is here to stay.

**Frequently Asked Questions**

**Where's the best place to buy ETH?**

There are many centralized exchanges that support Ethereum. If you live in the US, the most popular exchanges are Coinbase, Gemeni and Kraken. Coinbase users can use Coinbase Pro for lower fees.

**When is Eth2 launching?**

Eth2 is a marketing term used to represent a number of updates to Ethereum. The Eth2 proof-of-stake chain first launched in December 2020. ""The Merge"", which is the event that will fully switch Ethereum's consensus to proof-of-stake, is estimated to be ready in early 2022, although there is no exact timeline. Other updates, such as data shards, will follow that update.

Visit [ethmerge.com](https://ethmerge.com/) to learn more about ""The Merge"".

**Do I need to do anything to update to Eth2? Will Eth2 create a new token?**

No, ETH holders *never* need to take any action to keep holding ETH. Ethereum users will be unaffected by the Eth2 upgrade. And the Eth2 updates will not create any new tokens.

**How can I stake my ETH?**

There are two ways that you can stake your ETH: by running your own validator, or providing your ETH to a staking pool.

* Running your own validator requires a modern computer and 32 ETH. Visit /r/ethstaker for more details
* Staking pools accept any amount of ETH. We recommend [Lido](https://lido.fi/) or [StakeWise](https://stakewise.io/)

**Why are Ethereum transaction fees so high?**

Like most blockchains, Ethereum fees are determined by supply-and-demand. The large demand to use Ethereum has pushed transaction fees quite high (however, fees were just a few cents only 2 years ago). Fees are especially high during market volatility, and during NFT drops.

**What is being done to lower Ethereum transaction fees?**

Ethereum fees are reduced by using layer-2 rollups. Rollups are scaling solutions that allow for significantly cheaper transactions, while still maintaining Ethereum's security.

Additionally, Eth2's data shards will make rollups even cheaper.

While rollups are cutting-edge technology being actively developed, a number are already live on Ethereum mainnet. Visit [l2beat.com](https://l2beat.com/) to learn more about rollups.

**What's the best wallet for Ethereum?**

The most popular tool for using decentralized applications is Metamask. However, for security reasons, we recommend using a hardware wallet such as a Trezor or Ledger.

The Moral Case for Web3,"This is going to be somewhat lengthy so buckle up. There is a big jar of ü™ôcrypto at the end of the üåà rainbow ;)  


Recently a group of important voices have come out against Web3. These aren‚Äôt the usual technology adverse critics but rather voices that are in general pro technological innovation; People like Jack Dorsey and Tim O‚ÄôReilly but also others like Levi from Box.com and large parts of the entire gaming community also seems to have an issue with the fundamental morality of the Web3 project.

This should be taken seriously but instead of getting into a tit-for-tat with their claims I would like to zoom out a little bit more and try to explain why Web3 is not just a great technical innovation, it‚Äôs also morally superior to any societal solution we currently have, rendering the objections by critics moot.

Let's start with the obvious question: Why do we need a moral case for blockchain?

The answer is actually quite simple.

Any claimed solution to a problem, potentially affecting humans at large scale, need to to deliver on at least 4 axises.

* Non-coercive
* Fundamental
* Transparent
* Better problems

**Non-coercive**

A moral solution doesn't need to be forced, it will prove itself by improving the circumstances for those embracing it. Only through volunteer adoption can a solution said to be moral.

**Non-exclusive**

People who adopt the solution later aren't in principle excluded from participating in the upside early adopters enjoyed. Early adopters aren't in shielded from the downside of those adopting late.

**Transparent**

A morally superior system is not afraid of its own logic or the axioms it's built upon. In fact the superiority hinges on the accessibility of the rules and the reasoning governing the system.

**Better problems**

There is no such thing as a perfect solution.

All solutions come with their own unique problems.

The crucial difference is whether those problems are better problems to have than those it replaced.

**Ok but what problems does Web3/Crypto actually solve?**

At its core crypto solves the problem of trust.

This might sound underwhelming but once you start thinking about how many things in society are based on trust you quickly realize how important solutions to this problem are.

Trust in your friends, trust in your colleagues, trust in local government, federal, police, legal system, neighborhood, financial system, economic policies, the market, companies, ownership, your self! I could go on.

Nothing work without trust...

However trust isn't itself enough, trust needs a mechanism to function.

Very few relationships can be self-governed and require some sort of non-partisan transparent mediator to ensure that people with different, often opposing interest can trust the outcomes affecting them.

The magnum opus of this effort is the 3 branches of government separating the legislative, executive and judicial powers plus an error correcting mechanism through regular elections ensuring representation of everyones interests at least in theory.

The ingenuity of this invention historically cannot be emphasized enough. It's trough this, we've been able to build the myriad of institutions locally, nationally and internationally.

It's ensured an equilibrium of trust between non-trusting parties.

At least until now.

All systems have a limit to how much they can scale, be internally consistent and still effective.

With the advent of globalization through the use of technology, the sheer scale of ""cases"" that require mediation through 3rd parties is nothing short of a Cambrian explosion.

The current system, built post 2nd world war worked  when there were few banks, airlines, academics and no home computers.

It wasn't made for millions of investors, dronepilots, 100's of millions of academics and billions of smartphone users able to retrieve and collaborate.

There is so much information, so many perspectives and competing interests (obvious and non-obvious) at ods with each other that it's impossible for anyone to even understand a fraction of what is going on and thus more importantly to know what and who to trust.

This ever increasing opaqueness creates a fertile domestic and global breeding grund for special interest, gate keepers and intermediaries and erodes the ability for the system to stay honest where it matters.

If you agree that transparency and non-biased mediation is worth pursuing, if you agree that trust in our institutions is necessary, then the blockchain is the solution we've been needing.

Blockchain is the answer to a simple but important question:

*""How can we trust that a piece of information haven't been manipulated.""*

It does so through a public ledger whose entries are accessible and validated, not by any one organization or person, but by the network itself.

This network consist of nodes who's sole job it is to validate new entries into the ledger, incentivized by monetary gains for validation regardless of the specifics.

This has shown to be a very solid framework for non-biased validation, at scale and with efficiency.

Given the Turing Complete nature of smart contracts, any political, legal, international, organizational agreement/claim/process can be put ""on-chain"" without the ability for any one party to change the history of events and with the ability for everyone to validate.

Furthermore to the extent that more complex structures needs to be created, blockchain allow not only for governance but enforcement.

It solves all four previously mentioned criterion.

**It's non-coercive**

It can be implemented over time without destroying the current system. Instead a mirror of the existing system can be created and provide a better alternative with all the benefits described.

**It's non-exclusive.**

Because of the interoperable and permissionless structure of blockchain, everyone can participate or create their own alternatives to what exist.

Web3 doesn't benefit from network effect the way web2 do.

[https://twitter.com/Hello\_World/status/1470866414236061711](https://twitter.com/Hello_World/status/1470866414236061711)

**It's transparent**

Having an immutable publicly available ledger with every political claim, decision, process and event on-chain is the single most powerful tool against conspiring by the powerful against the powerless.

**It create better problems**

We can't create problem free solutions, but we can create better problems.

By solving the non-partisanship in mediation through network validation, transparency of governance and immutability of decisions, we can put our focus on better problems:

* Faster and more thorough legislation
* More contextually sensitive legal structure
* More nuanced decision making
* Faster decision making
* Fairer processes
* Previously impossible types of cooporation
* More quantifiable feedback loops
* Faster error correction

Blockchain as a framework for governance and enforcement is a more scalable, transparent and fairer system and allow us to further improve the advances already made by previous systems without having to destroy it first.

That's the moral case for web3.

P.S. This is the first draft of where I am going to spend my personal time in 2022. To take the criticism seriously and to address it head on with the intellectual honesty it  deserves. Hope the community will help do the same.

Thanks for reading this far hope you enjoyed it!
