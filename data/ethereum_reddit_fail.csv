Digital ownership in the AI era,"Chat GPT probably changed the world. The genie is out of the box now. AI is mainstream. 

With this rise, you can create art, music, writings and everything in between. 

There are multiple artists complaining that thier work gets referenced but not paid by GPT.  

Is this where digital ownership capabilities shine? 
What if artists would put their creations on chain and they would get payed a small amount when their work gets referenced / used for generating a result.  

Apps would become sort of ""frontends"" and Ethereum + other crypto projects (e.g.: file storage) would become a ""common"" backend. 

In that way, all one's my posts, photos, stories, tweets become self custoded and one gets payed.

"Patrick Hillman, director of strategy at Binance , said that the company may cease to exist in 10 years because the cryptocurrency market is moving towards DeFi.","This might sound like a stretch but honestly I wouldn’t be surprised. CeFi is proving itself to be a failed experiment. A virus that invaded a market built around the concept of self custody, decentralization, and self governance.

No one knows what will happen in 10 years time but I don’t see why people will start shifting from CeFi to DeFi completely.

The whole reason people used CeFi in the first place was convenience and low fees as opposed the ultra high Ethereum gas fees.

However, these two issues are almost fully resolved making a shift mass shift towards DeFi a much more logical decision than staying on these lying, corrupt centralized platforms.

Many DeFi platforms are becoming much more intuitive and easier to operate so that gets rid of the first issue.

The second issue, gas, is almost completely irrelevant now with L2s becoming more and more popular.

Not only are the older L2s getting better, but even some of newer ones like Mantle are showing hyper-scaling abilities in efforts to to make the Ethereum ecosystem more streamlines. Not only that but Ethereum based decentralized organizations invested a lot into it.  
Taking all of this into consideration, there’s really no excuse to choosing CeFi over DeFi especially after the various scandals that happened in the CeFi world.

These centralized platforms are only as powerful as we let them be. Us, as a collective, can easily pull the plug any moment we decided to.",218.0,2022-12-02 14:29:02,0.93

The fact that centralized platforms hold this much power in a space centered around decentralization is a problem. This isn’t what Vitalik or Satoshi envisioned.,"The entire reason cryptocurrencies were created to begin with because of centralized institutions like banks and governments taking control through financial means.

These centralized exchanges and other CeFi platforms aren’t any different.

They have full control over our hard earned funds and can legally do whatever they want with them. This is not to mention that they’re regulatory compliant meaning the government can basically tell them what to do.

How did it come this far? Ethereum and its dApps are a thing for a reason.

Why use a centralized exchange when DEXs are a thing especially when you take into consideration that they come with many more perks.

The “DeFi is expensive” arguments had long been dead with the advent of L2s and other scaling solutions.

The OGs like Arbitrum and Optimism are there for a reason. And now you got Ethereum based organizations like BitDAO investing hundreds of millions of dollars into scaling solutions which resulted in their most recent L2 launch Mantle with hyperscalability features for dApps and Web3 tech.

I’d hate to see all of this R&D money being wasted while we invest more into centralized exchanges.

Why dont we take advantage of all of this tech and the fact that L2s have become way more powerful, and start investing in DeFi instead??

Since then, developers have realized that maintaining a sustainable blockchain gaming ecosystem necessitates more than just the ability to earn, it necessitates an engaging core game design and gameplay mechanics that can keep players hooked and spending time on the game, in addition to a simple desire to earn.  


I played numerous of these games because I'm a huge fan of video games and I'm always eager to try something new, there are only a few that made me entertained, Splinterlands, WAM tournaments and Axie but only at the beginning.   


Some pay-to-win games are based on unsustainable tokenomics. Another common criticism leveled at the earlier generation of play-to-earn games is that they attract players based on ""Ponzinomics,"" in which the earnings of players who joined the game earlier are dependent on the ability to sell NFTs or tokens to new players.  


How do devs expect them to have more GameFi players when most people are not familiar with basic crypto terms?",155.0,2022-11-21 16:08:17,0.89

**Frequently Asked Questions**

**Where's the best place to buy ETH?**

There are many centralized exchanges that support Ethereum. If you live in the US, the most popular exchanges are Coinbase, Gemeni and Kraken. Coinbase users can use Coinbase Pro for lower fees.

**How can I stake my ETH?**

The best way to stake your ETH: by running your own validator.

* Running your own validator requires a modern computer and 32 ETH. Visit /r/ethstaker for more details

**Why are Ethereum transaction fees so high?**

Like most blockchains, Ethereum fees are determined by supply-and-demand. The large demand to use Ethereum has pushed transaction fees quite high (however, fees were just a few cents only 2 years ago). Fees are especially high during market volatility, and during NFT drops.

**What is being done to lower Ethereum transaction fees?**

Ethereum fees are reduced by using layer-2 rollups. Rollups are scaling solutions that allow for significantly cheaper transactions, while still maintaining Ethereum's security.

Additionally, data shards will make rollups even cheaper.

While rollups are cutting-edge technology being actively developed, a number are already live on Ethereum mainnet. Visit [l2beat.com](https://l2beat.com/) to learn more about rollups.

**What's the best wallet for Ethereum?**

The most popular tool for using decentralized applications is Metamask. However, for security reasons, we recommend using a hardware wallet such as a Trezor or Ledger.

Staked ETH2,"What are your thoughts on having ETH2 still staked on Coinbase? Should I wrap it and sell it and then buy back into ETH and move to my Trezor? The price difference to wrap and sell plus the fee would be about an automatic 4% loss, which I guess really isn't too big of a deal when looking at how far ETH has fallen this year in the bear market. Still, has held up reasonable well compared to the past. Should I just forget about the 4% loss to do this and get off the exchange ASAP? It's the only thing left on Coinbase besides my little bit of ALGO, which I'm about to move as well.",44.0,2022-11-20 21:49:20,0.92
Is validator uptime actually a vulnerability signal?,"Hear me out before burning me at the stake here. There are many assumptions taken in this post (OS, clients, fallback clients, etc.) and even more edge-cases that refute my thoughts. This post is intended to shed light on a general case that may apply to many validators, if not most, given it would seem to affect vanilla validator configurations.  

&#x200B;

Validator uptime is a publicly discernable attribute through missed-attestations, and as anybody running a validator should know, critical node maintenance like security updates oftentimes require a system restart that would result in publicly viewable downtime. If I was a malicious actor that wanted to attempt to gain access to validator keys by compromising these nodes, then this uptime metric could provide me a fast and easy ""short list"" of validators that *likely* have not gone through this maintenance effort. I could even rank my list depending on how long the validator has been online, targeting nodes that *potentially* have not been restarted in months (or years) with the assumption that security exploits are more effective on these nodes..

&#x200B;

Missing a few attestations is relatively painless from a financial perspective. If a node operator is hellbent on not performing maintenance on their system for whatever reason, would it make sense to ""pay"" a few cents each month and create a script that would cut network activity to the node for a few hours at the end of every month? If it were me, I think I would pay this low cost to avoid being placed on the malicious actors short list. Then again, if it were me, I would just update my node instead...",55.0,2022-11-20 16:21:18,0.95

Who verifies the data coming from first party oracles?,"
I have been reading up on API3 and if I am not mistaken one of their distinguishing features that sets it apart from Chain.Link is the idea of 1st party oracles. Which I understand to mean the owner of the data, originate the data themselves unto the blockchain.

My question is, who verifies such 1st oracle service? Like what is stopping such 1st oracle service to collude with some other players to modify, or even delay publication of data in such a way to be beneficial to the party they are colluding with?

My understanding is this is difficult, in theory, to do with 3rd party oracles like Chain.Link since the data are independently sought and then aggregated",31.0,2022-11-19 14:15:47,0.88

How to handle moving your assets from a hacked metamask wallet,"Hey everyone, sorry but this will be a long post:
I recently got my Metamask wallet hacked for some reason, and I would like some help on figuring out how it was hacked , and how to move my tokens to a new wallet.
I'm kind of experienced in the crypto world, so I wouldn't make mistakes like sharing my passphrase or putting it in my PC, clicking on phishy links, etc. I even looked up my MM permissions on revoke.cash and I had unlimited spend enabled on Uniswap only. Are there any other ways I could have got my wallet hacked? 
2) Thankfully the hacker didn't care much about my tokens( or most likely didn't notice them at all) so I took all my USDC and USDT out from the polygon and arbitrum networks. My issue lies in the Eth mainnet, I mean I don't have much money in tokens there(less than 40$), but I still would like to move them out, even with fees being so high. I also would like to move all my NFTs from pologon to a new wallet. So is there anyway to batch-send tokens and NFTs on ethreum mainnet and polygon?
3) Could you please offer some advice on how to protect myself from MM hacks? I'm really stressed out, like I'm trying to install linux alongside windows to protect myself from viruses and whatnot, and it feels bad getting your hard earned coins robbed. 
4) I have some ETH tokens that I couldn't sell on Uniswap before getting hacked due to low liquidity. Is there anyway to know when a token can be easily tradable on Uniswap? The ones I'm talking about average 3k-5k trading volume a day on Uniswap, which is pretty low I guess. I just don't want to send some eth to my wallet and have it trapped there(cause of the fees) for the hacker to steal.

Do you think the collapse of FTX is good or bad for the blockchain ecosystem?,"Thinking about this in the long-term. A lot of people joined crypto last year and trusted centralized exchanges. The CEX with the biggest political and press backing turned out to be one of the biggest frauds in history. Obviously, this hurts us. The press is having a field day blaming crypto - ""get out while you still can!""  


Thoughts:

\- This is free advertising for the value of decentralization for anyone who is still active

\- This may lead to a renewed push for open and decentralized protocols for next cycle

\- Lots of people who got burned may never return, or not for years

\- It's likely to be ammunition for regulations

Five trends that will push the adoption of blockchain,"I was so freaked out on the ongoing saga that the collapse of FTX is dominating the crypto headlines and has led many to write off the industry for good as billions in investors' funds have evaporated with no hope of regaining what was lost.    
 

According to Alexander Filatov, a co-founder and managing partner of EverX Labs, there are five main trends that will help the blockchain space surpass 1 billion users within the next 6 to 7 years. Have you heard about it?   
 

I didn't doubt that the first of these trends is GameFi, which is obviously a popular sector that emerged during the bull market of 2021 and introduced a way for gamers to earn money doing what they love.   
 

I noticed that this year I spent the most time playing blockchain games, such as WAM tournaments. I think that it's always the most exciting thing for me when it comes to blockchain games, these NFT awards, and the chance to compete with actual players.   
 

Don't you think that one of the most influential sectors that will bring about an accelerated adoption of blockchain technology and Web3 could be Metaverse? What do you think about that?   
 

The second growing trend is an increase in tokenization and NFT utility, the third trend cited by Filatov, as more scalable networks will be required to onboard new users, and the fourth trend, which will likely lead to an influx of money and participants in the crypto economy, is an increase in government intervention and the establishment of regulations related to the use of blockchain-enabled technologies.

Ethereum turns into first profitable blockchain from Top 10 of Crypto Market,"Prior to the Merge update and the continuous reduction in issuance, Ethereum, like any cryptocurrency network on the market, was the ""unprofitable"" blockchain. However, things have changed.   
 

It's important to note that a blockchain's ""profitability"" is not the same as a company's profitability in traditional finance. Technically, subtracting new issuance from fee burns allows us to determine whether or not the network is profitable.   
 

So, as far as I can tell, the blockchain's profitability benefits neither its holders nor new investors. Deflation, on the other hand, has the potential to be a significant speculative growth factor for cryptocurrency in the future.   
 

However, while the rallying Ethereum will benefit investors and traders, dApps users and developers will be forced to make transactions with higher fees and possible network congestion. Unfortunately, during high network loads, Ethereum requires users to pay up to $15 per network operation.   
 

I remember at the beginning it was quite chaos dealing with transactions and gas fees, I started using Metis from the start, and the discovery of L2 solutions was the greatest discovery for me as far as I can tell lol.    
 

Various foundations and projects, however, are constantly working on Ethereum's scalability by offering new mechanisms for processing transactions or alternative Layer 2 networks that take some of the load off the main network, offering higher throughput, shorter processing times, and low fees.",114.0,2022-11-17 15:47:42,0.88

She just went live again (pro tip: pay for VPS by crypto- I chose usdc over ethereum- to sidestep whatever regulation moved Rack Nerd to ask for selfie KYC photos): 

I've tried to give developers a way to essentially outsource input validation by including a simple form template in their repo. That way, bots can remain super low-resource command-line applications but a user's experience is still basically graphical. 


At the moment there's a limit bot (works with the Binance CEX and EVM-compatible blockchains like Ethereum) and a telegram buy bot (which tbh I just made to demonstrate the botiq library 🤷🏽‍♂️). 

A simple alarm bot, a classic grid bot and a DCA bot are coming soon, and then I can start to get more creative! Of course, it's supposed to be a platform for other devs to share their bots too- both crypto and non-crypto related 😉.

This is actually phase 2 in my long-suffering plan to bring automated strategies to *everyone* and even the playing field out there. I think it's a very necessary gap to close.

My first attempt, [Botchi](https://github.com/neauangle/botchi/), was a monolithic bot suite that *works* but it's complicated to use and its reliance on a GUI makes it terrible for running on a VPS. Plus, the bot designer is *fine* but programming languages really are our best tools to define logical flows. I figured it's better to focus on devs- I wrote a high-level library called [Botiq](https://www.npmjs.com/package/botiq) that makes writing crypto bots pretty easy- and then bridge the gap between developers and end-users with something like The Bot Shed.

Marketplace for Goerli Eth,"Please hear me out. 

Over the past few days I have really struggled to find Goerli Eth that I can use for testing purposes. The best I can do is use the 0.2/day Alchemy Faucet. I have also tried using the pk910 faucet but this has an even lower yield. 

This has immensely pissed me off to the point where I would pay money for Goerli Eth - obviously hugely discounted from the price of regular eth. As a result I was thinking about setting up a marketplace for Goerli Eth. 

If you think about it from an economics perspective demand for Goerli Eth can be high as you are more likely to have to test and retest things, and because there is no point selling your goerli eth people just sit on it.

I know this is against the philosophy of a test net but I cant see another viable alternative unless of course people are perfectly happy with the Goerli eth supply they are getting in which case let me know!

Ethereum based DAOs are helping boost adoption and utilize crypto in regions like Africa and Asia. This is exactly what Ethereum was created for,"I remember how Vitalik once mentioned that the main goal behind Ethereum is to help humanity and society become more self reliant and eventually escape the grasps of tyrannical figures and institutions.

And while this still might be far from happening, it is the end goal that all of us as a community are working to eventually achieve.

It will take time but the goal is there.

If fact we’re already seeing decentralized organizations helping out the people who need self governance the most.

Many people living in certain African and Asian countries are under the full control of corrupt tyrannical governments and institutions and thus, Ethereum and Ethereum-based decentralized projects can be the most effective there.

This is very evident by the fact that the MENA region has registered the highest crypto market growth in 2022. Plus there are some Ethereum based organizations like BitDAO that are funding subdaos like AfricaDAO to help boost adoption in African regions and give the people there a taste of well needed self governance.

This is all very revolutionary, but again, this movement is still in its infancy but it’s progress nonetheless. Everything needs to start somewhere, right?

All I really care about is seeing Ethereum and all the projects and dApps built on it actually get utilized in the real world.

And not just that, they’re being utilized in a way that might end up improving the way of life for hundreds of millions of people eventually. So I’m all in for this. Hopefully I can witness this movement completely unfold in my lifetime.",46.0,2022-11-16 04:56:18,0.89

Future of Crypto?,"Sorry for the somewhat vague title here, but I really am interested what you all think about the future of crypto after this week’s events?

The downfall of both Terra and FTX is sure to ignite the wrath of regulators on the crypto space.

Like you all, I believe that the underlying technology behind cryptocurrencies can help to solve a myriad of societal problems. At the same time, having worked in the tech industry for two decades, it’s also clear to me that radical technologies, like the Internet and cryptocurrencies, do not always evolve in an ideal way.

What I’m particularly curious about is what a future with Crypto, CBDCs, and inevitable regulations will look like. What will be the role of crypto?

I’ve been thinking about this even more recently, and my conclusion is that, barring an effective banning of crypto (which I believe is pretty much impossible at this point), crypto will serve as both a testbed and release valve for fiat policies.

Consider that Bitcoin started in response to the 2008 financial crisis and exploded in popularity due to unpopular fiat policies, particularly Quantitative Easing. It has also served as an independent safe haven for residents of nations dealing with a failed fiat currency. However, it has (so far) not lived up to the promise of a hedge against inflation.

The advent of Ethereum and unlocking of smart contracts is another great example where cryptocurrencies shined and provided a testbed for financial experiments. This would otherwise have been impossible in a strictly fiat world.

What do you think?",43.0,2022-11-14 21:50:11,0.87
ETH2 vs. cbETH,"Hi team,

In the wake of the FTX debacle I felt quite a bit of fear and skepticism around centralized exchanges. Based on that, I no longer wanted to keep my Staked ETH (ETH2) on Coinbase. In order to move it off the exchange I wrapped my staked ETH2 into the new coin created by Coinbase called Wrapped Staked ETH (cbETH) and moved it to my LedgerNanoX. My fear now is that if Coinbase halts trading or goes down for whatever reason then cbETH will go to $0. Does this make sense and should I move my cbETH back  to ETH2 and continue staking because at this point if Coinbase goes down the cbETH won't be worth anything anyway?

&#x200B;

Many thanks,

HexusD

&#x200B;

{{Update}}

&#x200B;

11/16/2022 I wrapped my staked ETH2 into cbETH. From there I was then able to send cbETH to my Ledger and import my Ledger account into MetaMask. This allowed me to bring cbETH onto MetaMask and sync on Uniswap. On Uniswap I converted my cbETH back to ETH and took the 5% hit plus a little gas. This was worth it for me because I am now completely off CEX (Coinbase) and not tied to a coin that isn't pegged to anything (cbETH). Thanks for all the suggestions, WAGMI.

Eth app idea,"I'm planning to possibly build a dapp and am wondering if anyone can help sanity check the idea.

Ultimately I'm building it because I want to see it built, and if someone else steals the idea and builds it that's fine by me. Also, if there are similar projects that already do this please link them so I can investigate.

The core concept of this is essentially a pool/prize, where people can donate money into, and with each donation they can submit a name (string), of a public figure etc.

At the end of some cyclical period. It will tally the string that gets the most 'votes'/'money' put towards it. It will then use some form of consensus algorithm (or possibly another vote,or if nothing else possibly manual trigger by some admin group) ... where the entire pool will be donated to the wallet owner of the name of the string.

The use case is very simple.

It will allow people in democratic countries to lobby (bribe but stfu) politicians in the same way corporations do.

It sets a gigantic monetary reward that every person in power can clearly SEE, and thus gives them PERSONAL financial motivation to do whatever is in their power to meet that goal.

Seeing as no-name scumbag dead projects sometimes get multi-million dollar valuations at their bubble peak; It would be cool if we could just use that as a prize pool to bait/lure the most scummy self-serving republican (or career democrat) politician to... I dunno pass public health care reform in the US not because he cares about people or the country... only because he wants that 20M directly sent to his wallet.",35.0,2022-11-14 09:09:40,0.76

**Frequently Asked Questions**

**Where's the best place to buy ETH?**

There are many centralized exchanges that support Ethereum. If you live in the US, the most popular exchanges are Coinbase, Gemeni and Kraken. Coinbase users can use Coinbase Pro for lower fees.

**How can I stake my ETH?**

The best way to stake your ETH: by running your own validator.

* Running your own validator requires a modern computer and 32 ETH. Visit /r/ethstaker for more details

**Why are Ethereum transaction fees so high?**

Like most blockchains, Ethereum fees are determined by supply-and-demand. The large demand to use Ethereum has pushed transaction fees quite high (however, fees were just a few cents only 2 years ago). Fees are especially high during market volatility, and during NFT drops.

**What is being done to lower Ethereum transaction fees?**

Ethereum fees are reduced by using layer-2 rollups. Rollups are scaling solutions that allow for significantly cheaper transactions, while still maintaining Ethereum's security.

Additionally, data shards will make rollups even cheaper.

While rollups are cutting-edge technology being actively developed, a number are already live on Ethereum mainnet. Visit [l2beat.com](https://l2beat.com/) to learn more about rollups.

**What's the best wallet for Ethereum?**

The most popular tool for using decentralized applications is Metamask. However, for security reasons, we recommend using a hardware wallet such as a Trezor or Ledger.

"Crypto gaming needs to be fun to be successful — money doesn't matter, do you agree?","Do you think that most cryptocurrency games today lack the mechanics to keep players interested for even a short period of time?  


I read one interesting article about this and made me think why haven’t more top-tier games introduced real-world rewards into their games?   


I'm referring to titles in which 99.9% of gamers are not professional esports athletes and receive no monetary compensation for thousands of hours spent playing their favorite games. The possibility of introducing monetary incentives has always been on the table. Why hasn't it been   


Games need to avoid injecting monetary rewards into an experience that is designed to be intrinsically rewarding. The gameplay should be most important because that's the thing that keeps players attracted to the game and entertained. Have you seen how awesome WAM tournaments are? Well, that's the exact reason I'm captivated by that game, it's insane and we need more games that are fun and worth playing.  


The fact is that nobody will invest hundreds of hours in an activity that isn't fun unless it pays a lot of money. And you can only pay out a large sum of money if a large number of users collaborate to create a significant amount of value. This quickly becomes a death spiral for nascent crypto games, as the games are unable to generate enough value to adequately reward players for spending hours inside an unrewarding game loop.  


Instead of starting with economics or haphazardly adding crypto to a working game loop, developers should create games that people want to play. A play-to-earn mechanism could destroy the retention of even a fantastic game with high retention numbers.

A lesson from FTX,"It seems like the most popular takeaway after FTX has been revealed to be insolvent is that self custody is the safest way to go. However, I believe most people are overlooking the biggest concern that could be drawn from it. There were 3 giant centralized exchanges in cryptocurrency: Binance, Coinbase, and FTX. One of them is now on the edge of bankruptcy. There is a huge danger in narrowing that list to two. If a large percentage of people decide to sell after what’s happened, how can we know that Coinbase and Binance have enough liquidity to facilitate withdrawals? The gains that crypto has seen dwarf the revenue collected by exchanges. 

One of the first things that happened during the Great Depression were mass attempts to withdraw cash from banks who did not have that cash on hand. Stable coins are not a solution. If you can’t sell them, you can’t spend them. Tether limited is not a central bank. No matter how much USDT is minted, they cannot create more USD out of thin air.

I’m not trying to fear monger, but people should be more concerned and should be demanding more transparency for centralized exchanges. Hardware wallets cannot be frozen. But if centralized platforms don’t have enough cash to pay out to those who want to sell, then it completely undercuts any value proposition for cryptocurrency regardless of whatever the price is or how much your wallet is saying it’s worth.",605.0,2022-11-12 00:53:26,0.92

Its funny how so many more people are getting scammed on these “regulated” platforms versus unregulated ones.,"DeFi has always been synonymous with “scams” because it’s unregulated meaning there’s no central authority that can thoroughly check the legitimacy of a project before it gets listed.

This (at least in theory) should make CeFi much safer than DeFi considering there are standards to be met.

But the reality is that a lot of standards are being completely ignored. Standards that are putting billions of dollars in funds at risk as we’ve seen with FTX most recently.

There’s no reason for anyone to be using CeFi over DeFi especially when you take into consideration the power of custody and the fact that DeFi is now way more efficient with L2s taking over.  
Fees on L2s like Loopring right now are minimal and other L2s like Polygon have tens of thousands of dApps to choose from. Uniswap alone is boasting huge numbers on Polygon and their zkEVM is making it much easier for developers to build and migrate contracts.

It makes literally zero sense to use CeFi over DeFi.

“Its more convenient” well yeah up until the platform you have your money on ends up drying out your hard earned money and blocks you from accessing them since you already signed away the rights of custody…

Its time for this community to put an end to this madness and start taking the right choices. The fact that CeFi got to this much power alone is a huge f#ck up.",226.0,2022-11-11 11:34:00,0.88

"Which L2 protocol do you have the most trust in, and why?","We are all aware that, despite being the leading blockchain for developing decentralized apps, Ethereum is frequently chastised for high gas fees and slow transactions; even if the merger occurred, there are some things that should be done.  


Do you use any tools to help you deal with all of these ETH issues? Last week, I read an online article about Layer 2s, and there are a couple of great solutions, some of which I've tried and some of which I'm currently using, which is the scaling protocol Metis. It helps with all of these issues, such as high gas prices and slow transactions, which are, as previously stated, characteristics of ETH.  


Since I read about these protocols, solutions, and all the needed help with problems we're dealing with using ETH, I'd like to know a little bit more about it from your personal experience.  


Are you satisfied with the Merge after some time has passed? What did you expect, and did it meet your expectations? How do you deal with all of the other ETH issues that every holder/trader faces?  


I should mention that the Metis platform has a variety of use cases, including assisting users in developing their own NFT minting, yield farming, which I've been using as well, and DEX, which is fantastic, so there are some reasons why this platform appears trustworthy to me.

Zero-Knowledge Proofs application in Ethereum,"Ethereum is a public ledger and by its design, it’s meant to be transparent. However, there is confusion about it being anonymous because many people still believe that the blockchain in general is anonymous, which is false. Anything can be tracked on the ledger, including the details of every transaction and deal you’ve made since you started trading. It may not be a big deal to some, especially to those who don’t understand that their personal privacy can easily be violated as a result of this. 

People are starting to realize that there is a big privacy gap in crypto. This has been amplified by the disturbing push for the adoption of CBDCs by the government which will give them some level of control over the finances of the general masses. Zero-Knowledge proofs have been cited by many to be revolutionary, especially when it comes to building privacy tools.

ZKPs are encryption schemes in which a party who is a prover proves their case of truth concerning specific data on the other party,a verifier without revealing the information. Here are few of the projects that have worked around the technology to build an important utility- privacy in crypto.  

1. Aztec offers users privacy utilizing layer 2 solutions, specifically the zk rollups system. Users send transaction requests to Aztec and the transactions are then put into a batch, and rolled up with other users' transactions, which can lead to a longer processing time but has privacy baked in at a base layer. 
2. Railgun is a privacy-preserving smart contract wallet developed on Ethereum and uses zk-SNARKs to obfuscate transaction details and make anonymous transactions of any Erc 20 tokens or Erc 721 tokens. Users also get privacy at rest, meaning they can keep a private balance which wasn’t possible on previous L1 privacy protocols.It works by removing all identifying information from transactions. It’s similar to a MetaMask or any other wallet, just with privacy preserving zk-SNARKs in place.
3. Zether is a confidential (transaction amounts are hidden) and anonymous (transaction sender and receiver are hidden) payment mechanism on blockchains with an account model like Ethereum. It is implemented as a smart contract called ZSC. One of the major limitations that Zether is known for is that transactions get processed at the end of a current epoch, inferring that it can be quite difficult on a busy network. However, it is quite promising and has everything it takes to be among the major players in private crypto overtime. 

I believe that there are many other ways to keep a private balance on Ethereum. As a privacy maxi, I would love to hear this subreddit’s thoughts on what’s out there in this area.  A time will come when privacy will become a big word in crypto and we’ll have the bulk of crypto users keeping their on-chain activities private.",51.0,2022-11-10 09:25:37,0.87

"Decentralised Social Network growing rapidly, without us.","These past weeks have been quite extraordinary. Everyone around me has been talking about decentralisation, except the crypto folks.

The federated social network and microblogging system [Mastodon](https://joinmastodon.org/) has been growing at an incredible rate as users migrate away from Twitter.

We see that it crossed
6,132,414 users today and is growing at over 5k/hour. See here for stats:
https://bitcoinhackers.org/@mastodonusercount

Thousands of new instances are being set up. See also [this](https://mastodon.social/@0xDUDE/109299721722276122).

This is quite phenomenal for a decentralised, federated network running on open source software, where anyone can run their own ~~node~~ instance.

Academics are coordinating to move to mastodon en masse. Journalists too are moving. A lot of effort is going in to this and a lot of experimentation / hands-on improvisation: They are even passing around text files and [google](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1rNfUosPSiMwRbUAbnI3h-7D9grP6ULgS/) [docs] (https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/13No4yxY-oFrN8PigC2jBWXreFCHWwVRTftwP6HcREtA/) full of account names so that people can recreate their twitter networks on mastodon. It's humans instead of AIs suggesting accounts to follow.

This week has seen articles on mastodon in general and on how to get set up in [wired](https://www.wired.com/story/how-to-find-twitter-friends-on-mastodon/), [wired2](https://www.wired.com/story/join-mastodon-twitter-alternative/), [the guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/media/2022/nov/01/mastodon-twitter-elon-musk-takeover), [time](https://time.com/6229230/mastodon-eugen-rochko-interview/), [nytimes](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/11/07/technology/mastodon-twitter-elon-musk.html), [bbc](https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-63534240), [thejournal](https://www.thejournal.ie/what-is-mastodon-and-how-do-i-join-it-ireland-5912976-Nov2022/), [sz](https://www.sueddeutsche.de/wirtschaft/mastodon-twitter-netzwerk-dezentral-1.5574623), and so many more.. 

The trigger for this has been the turmoil at Twitter. But whatever the cause, and whatever you think about Elon Musk making Twitter his personal property, I would have expected this community to be excited about a mass movement to Mastodon, and actively encouraging it / joining in. Surely this community understands that a decentralised social network in which moderation is local/opt-in, in which you can move your account to another node at any time and keep your followers, in which you can run your own node, that this is an extremely valuable thing in itself, and that it opens the space up to so much more development, improvement, and experimentation.

Instead, I find that among my followings, everyone except the crypto crowd is trying to decentralise while this community just shrugs.

It might not be a web3 utopia, but its a lot better than one privately owned network. Here is a chance to move things in the right direction... and yet ..

Why? 
Shouldn't we give it a go? Try it out? 
It's open source. Adding ENS authentication is [one PR away](https://github.com/mastodon/mastodon). Adding IPFS/Swarm support is [one PR away](https://github.com/mastodon/mastodon). We can even [host our own instances](https://docs.joinmastodon.org/user/run-your-own/) to experiment while still being connected to the wider network.

I'd love to see you all over there!

"If we ever want DeFi to go mainstream, L2s should be a major focus point for everyone.","I’m saying this because DeFi is notorious for having high gas fees and long waiting times versus the very cheap and fast operations of CeFi.

Of course, with CeFi, you’re trading custody of your own coins for that speed and cheap gas which is extremely bad for the future of crypto as a whole.

Look at what SBF is pushing for example. It awful.

We NEED more adoption when it comes to DeFi because by the way I see it, if we keep up this pace then CeFi will soon take over.

This is exactly why I think L2s are critical for the future of DeFi as a whole. They are the only way for dApps to scale and thus gain more users daily.

We’re already starting to see a push in terms of development from L2s. DeFi has become extremely cheaper on them, especially with L2 like Loopring.

Other L2s like Polygon ended up developing an open source zkEVM has proven to be successful with developers using it to build more dApps in a much easier and cheaper way. You can see this with Polygon already having some of the major dApps like Aave, Uniswap, Curve, Aavegotchi, Decentraland, and many more.

We cant expand DeFi to go full mainstream if it remains expensive, and although we’re seeing A LOT of improvements in that regard, we still need to keep it up.

I think that the upcoming Ethereum updates to the PoS chain will definitely help and give DeFi a boost but ultimately, it is up to the L2s to find new and more advanced way to make DeFi cheaper.",35.0,2022-11-03 13:18:43,0.85

**Only logical explanation i can think of is that Barclays are now conducting market research on their customers who send money to crypto exchanges in preparation for offering custody services. I'm guessing it'll be packaged in some way to make it more palatable to their wealthy clients, perhaps an ''ISA'' type account or some form of passive fund where Barclays/Copper take custody**

5.5 years of sending money from my bank account to Kraken, I've never had one e-mail or call to verify anything, let alone any fraud prevention calls.

I send a small sum as a test transaction - **lands in on the exchange in minutes**

I send £2000 to the same address 10 mins later **& receive a call IMMEDIATELY**

Some of the questioning was just odd & very intrusive, but has never ever happened before.

The anti-fraud stuff i understand asking **my details & ''where are you sending this & how did you fund it ''** etc but then, proceeded to ask me, **what was basically a market research questionnaire that I was emphatically told was ''necessary to clear the funds'' but in hindsight wasn't at all & the lady backed down & cleared the funds.** 

&#x200B;

* **''So, what crypto coin are you buying...?''** \- excuse me? what relevance does that have? maybe i'm sending it to the exchange so i have liquid cash ready to deploy in future? that is so intrusive. All you need to know is that, yes it is me sending it & i know the account im sending it to....the lady asked me multiple times & **said the funds wouldn't be cleared** until i refused outright & suddenly it wasn't **''necessary''** anymore?

* **''Do you use a 3rd party to buy crypto''** \- what on earth has this got to do with anything?

&#x200B;

* **''How much research do you conduct before you buy cryptocurrencies?'**' - again, what?

The above link makes a lot more sense now in hindsight & I've never been more convinced banks like Barclays are edging closer to becoming a ''trusted'' 3rd party for their customers to gain exposure to crypto, without having to actually custody the assets themselves. **This is HUGE for institutional investors & lo and behold, Barclays now own a large stake in a UK, crypto, custody company.

The reason gas prices have been declining for the past 4 quarters despite having over 100% gas usage,"####**The Enigma**

One interesting curiosity I've noticed is that **Ethereum gas prices have been falling 20-40% each quarter since EIP-1559 initiated DESPITE gas usage being over the 100% 15M target gas usage.**

This is surprising because normally under EIP-1559, if each block stays exactly at the 100% gas target, gas price will also stay exactly the same.

|**Date**|**Block Time**|**Blocks**|**Gas % used**|**Gas Price (Gwei)**|**Notes**|

|2021 Q1|13|6503|80%|150||
|2021 Q2|13|6463|92%|87||
|2021 Q3|13|6430|99%|67|EIP-1559 introduced|
|2021 Q4|13|6370|**102%**|**117**||
|2022 Q1|13|6454|**101%**|**95**||
|2022 Q2|14|6112|**101%**|**59**||
|2022 Q3|13|6482|**101%**|**21**||
|2022 Oct|12|7157|102%|23|Post-Merge|

####**So why is this happening?**

This counter-intuitive phenomenon can be explained by simple math. After EIP-1559, gas price changes whenever the previous block's gas usage deviates from 15M gas. It increases by 12.5% at 30M gas, and decreases by 12.5% at 0M gas. Any value between the 2 limits affects price proportionally up to 12.5%.

**So what happens if a 30M-gas block were followed by a 0M-gas block?**

    (x+a) * (x-a) = x^2 - a^2
    (1 + 0.125) * (1 - 0.125) = 98.4% => 2.6% price decrease

Thus if a 30M-gas block were followed by a 0M-gas block, the gas price would still fall 2.6% even though the average gas usage stays at 15M gas. The larger the volatility from the 15M-gas target, the larger the negative price pressure.

**In fact, in an extreme theoretical case where there were one full day of 30M-gas blocks followed by another full day of 0M-gas blocks, the gas price on the 3rd day would be 10^50 times smaller despite that the average usage between the 2 days was still 15M gas**. Obviously, validators will not magically be able to process transactions 10^50 times cheaper, so this is completely theoretical.

**Nevertheless, the effect is there, and we have been experiencing a 20-40% decrease in gas prices quarterly since EIP-1559 was introduced in Aug 2021. Though the decrease has slowed down since The Merge.**

A mix of these 2 cases will continue happening until a dynamic market equilibrium is reached:

1. Gas price keeps falling every quarter
1. Daily gas usage rises noticeably above its current 102% average. (Edit: I did some simulations afterwards. Gas usage actually remains around 102-103% of 15M when the price remains stable. So it's actually not as noticeable as I thought.)

------------------------

**Edit**: I thought about it more, and it does seem to either be a bug or a purposeful design flaw.

Let's say you have 3 fee changes of a, b, and c where the sum of all 3 is zero. You have to find a fee formula f(x) where the product, f(a) * f(b) * f(c) = 1.

So I figured out the correct formula is to use any exponential function. For example:

    a + b = -c
    e^a * e^b * e^c = e^a * e^b * e^(-a-b) = 1

I was going to report it, but looks like **someone else** already mentioned it a long time ago: https://ethresear.ch/t/make-eip-1559-more-like-an-amm-curve/9082/2

Guess they never bothered fixing it.

"Ethereum has become extremely sustainable. For reference, YouTube spends 244 TW/yr meanwhile Ethereum PoS spends 0.004% that number.","The reason I chose something like YouTube is because its somewhat tech related in comparison to something like gold mining (which uses up around 240 TW/yr).

In fact, lets mention other tech and Web2 related things like Netflix and the US gaming industry which spend 94 and 34 TW/yr respectively.

Ethereum has come a long way from 112 to 0.01 which is ground breaking progress honestly. This will allow more and more companies and institutions to move into the Web3 space and start building on Ethereum without having to worry anymore about the sustainability issues that the blockchain used to suffer from.

This is major news for mainstream adoption considering that these companies joining the Web3 space will give Ethereum great exposure.

Sure, gas fees will still remain high for now but many projects, dApps, and companies as well are resorting to L2s.

Polygon for example has been a major contributor to the Ethereum ecosystem inviting companies like Facebook, Instagram, Starbucks and many more. And with the zkEVM testnet launched, many devs are finding it easier to build on Ethereum through Polygon.

Think about it, Ethereum still has a lot of upgrades on the way yet we’re already seeing some mainstream companies and brands building a Web3 presence for themselves on it. Imagine the impact on adoption that the upcoming upgrades will have.

"To quote Mihailo Bjelic: “If you can't see and verify the code, it's not safe and it's not Ethereum”","Ethereum is a community led network. The main goal behind Ethereum is for people to be able to self-govern so it should come as a given that anything built on Ethereum and willing to follow its main core and values, should have an open source code.

That’s it, there are no loopholes. There are no exceptions. There are no if, and, or buts.

An application, network, or rollup that retains the value of Ethereum should retain open source code

Just because a rollup **\*claims\*** to follow EVM equivalence doesn’t automatically mean that it truly does.

Take ZkSync for example. They are constantly being criticized by the community and especially rivaling developers for the fact that they claim to have “the first ever zkEVM” when in reality no one even knows if it even works. The code is completely closed source which is a big non amongst developers.

This is actually the main reason behind Mihailo Bjelic’s tweet (the title of this post).

Mihailo is one of the leading developers at Ethereum scaling solution, Polygon. So it wouldn’t come as a surprise that there’s some rivalry between him and the ZkSync team.

However, when confronted about having a closed source zkEVM versus Polygon’s open source, some ZkSync supporters started coming up with excuses and fork accusations all of which were shut down by what I think is any Ethereum community member could have said. Mihailo stated:

***“Open source code and verifiability are some of the core Ethereum values.***

***Polygon zkEVM (and everything else we build) follows these values.***

***The community needs to demand this from every scaling project. If you can't see and verify the code, it's not safe and it's not Ethereum.”***  


Regardless of whether it was Polygon, Scroll, Zksync, Loopring, Arbitrum, Optimism, or any other rollup, this statement should be applied.

As I said, there should never be an excuse as to why your code is closed source on Ethereum. This is a network that is led by the community and is constantly getting improved and protected by said community as well.

If this community cannot access your code, you are technically violating everything Ethereum stands for.",158.0,2022-10-25 23:09:00,0.92
We need a function within ETH to timeout transactions that are in pending hell,"So I just dealt with a transaction in pending hell because I made a mistake. In doing research I found 

1. this actually happens to a lot of people. Mostly newer, but at the rate of people running into this. It isn't something you can walk backwards in.
2. the current no timeout system makes it less user-friendly. 

&#x200B;

# Solution:

A simple solution is a timeout function within ETH that you can opt out from. So basically, if a transaction has been in pending hell for a week or 2 (after x blocks) mark it as dropped.

&#x200B;

What could happen is there could be a way to opt out. Like if the transaction says ""no timeout"" then it opts out. On metamask or whatever this can be done mostly on the backend and this gives the user the ability to use some checkbox or whatever if they wanted to opt out of this. 

If you opt out then it should basically do what it does now. 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Beyond this obviously the guides will have to be updated, and people will have to be inform the average transaction after x date will timeout after a week or 2. The person can override the transaction like they do now if they didn't want to wait or they opt out.",29.0,2022-10-25 17:00:45,0.76
Looking for developer feedback on our new no-code blockchain filtering tool!," Hey blockchain fam,

A lot of developers we spoke with pointed out that almost every Web3 project requires meaningful blockchain activity to be ingested into a centralized backend programmatically. This can take a while and be rather tedious.

So, we built hal Streams.

Our mission with this product is:

* Provide a free solution to Web3 builder
* Introduce a no-code way to query and filter on-chain data through an API
* Make the most user-friendly solution on the market

**We're looking for our earliest adopters who can give us feedback :)**

**Hal Streams is totally free to start using,** btw. And hopefully, you will find it very useful!

**Frequently Asked Questions**

**Where's the best place to buy ETH?**

There are many centralized exchanges that support Ethereum. If you live in the US, the most popular exchanges are Coinbase, Gemeni and Kraken. Coinbase users can use Coinbase Pro for lower fees.

**How can I stake my ETH?**

The best way to stake your ETH: by running your own validator.

* Running your own validator requires a modern computer and 32 ETH. Visit /r/ethstaker for more details

**Why are Ethereum transaction fees so high?**

Like most blockchains, Ethereum fees are determined by supply-and-demand. The large demand to use Ethereum has pushed transaction fees quite high (however, fees were just a few cents only 2 years ago). Fees are especially high during market volatility, and during NFT drops.

**What is being done to lower Ethereum transaction fees?**

Ethereum fees are reduced by using layer-2 rollups. Rollups are scaling solutions that allow for significantly cheaper transactions, while still maintaining Ethereum's security.

Additionally, data shards will make rollups even cheaper.

While rollups are cutting-edge technology being actively developed, a number are already live on Ethereum mainnet. Visit [l2beat.com](https://l2beat.com/) to learn more about rollups.

**What's the best wallet for Ethereum?**

The most popular tool for using decentralized applications is Metamask. However, for security reasons, we recommend using a hardware wallet such as a Trezor or Ledger.

I have a question,"It is about Ethereum's use as a common, usual payment (i.e. card payment  at convenience stores) method. I consider this to be a very important issue, and others here do not seem to perceive it as so important. Is that true?

Regarding the common(usual) payment method of Ethereum,

1. It doesn't have to be like that at all. The present state is sufficient.
2. It is a desirable, but not urgent issue to do so.
3. It must be so.

For Ethereumers, which of these three opinions is the mainstream opinion? Especially, what is Vitalik Buterin's position?

the best way to measure and compare different off-chain scaling solutions,"Hey guys!

Recently, I read lots of different articles about scaling solutions and in the next semester, I have the opportunity to make my thesis about this topic.

My first idea about it is that it is easier and more obvious to focus on only off-chain scaling solutions on top of Ethereum. My personal opinion is that it is really hard to define the set of on-chain scaling solutions and the comparison and the measurement will be harder because usually, these different approaches mean different blockchain ecosystems.

My plan is to choose implementations from each different off-chain scaling type (sidechains, validiums, plasma chains, optimistic rollups, zero-knowledge rollups, and state channels) and compare them to each other. The comparison is based on security, decentralization, and scalability examination.

The decentralization examination is based on three metrics Gini coefficient, Shannon entropy, and Nakamoto coefficient. The scalability examination is based on the transaction cost, throughput and latency. Maybe, I could also examine the message and time complexity like in a distributed system. I do not know what will be the best metric for security yet. 

What do you think is the best way to compare different off-chain solutions from security, scalability, and decentralization points of view? And what is your about this kind of paper?

We tried tying together some thoughts that have been floating around the community with some original takes into a coherent thesis:

\- To fully enjoy the massive improvements in data capacity ([EIP-4844](https://www.eip4844.com/) and [Sharding](https://ethereum.org/en/upgrades/sharding/)), applications will need a significant increase in computational scalability.

\- The best way to scale computation is rollups. The best kind of rollups for this purpose are application-specific optimistic rollups with interactive dispute resolutions.

\- These designs allow us to explore different execution environments: helping us to tackle deep programmability issues.

\- The design space around execution environments is massive and can help us integrate efficiently with all the infrastructure previously built for web2.

\- Data capacity + computational capacity + improved programmability = a significant increase in the kinds of applications that our industry can support.

The Last Frontier of Crypto Is Getting Out From Under CeFi Offramp Completely,"I think ultimately the key manner in which the US will bully european countries and other G20 countries into compliance with protocol censorship is through the abuse of offramps.

>67% is enough to fork non compliant validators of the network and the minority fork will not be listed on compliant exchanges.  
>  
>The entire ethereum eco system has 0 dex's with fiat on/off ramps. The censorship resistant minority fork would have to rely on bitcoin dex's like hodlhodl, bisq or robosats to onboard new users.

In other posts I have pointed out that this is primarily what they did with Panama Papers, so the Offramp are key

Offramp are how you ban entire tokens, and more importantly it's how you ban entire smart contracts. The US's main strategy in the works seems to be attacking and fragmenting liquidity and blacklisting entire smart contracts, they will primarily abuse offramps and anything without base layer privacy, though I think increasingly the US may not allow monero deposits, EU may not either.

I think BISQ is our prototype for how this all needs to be done. In some sense BISQ isn't really anonymous, it certainly involves banks and KYC. However we are missing the point with the behavior of the US

They do what they do because they are ""Cronys"", they abuse aml/kyc policy to enforce unattainable licensing, to restrict financial freedom for normal citizens (I'll let you infer this politically). 

Crypto's achilles heel is the western legal language surrounding custodianship, and indeed property is 9/10ths the law and most of Western regulatory law is obsessed with custodianship. 

Financial, political, and civil freedom comes from \*being able to access products and smart contracts that Centralized Exchanges will not list, and being able to cash out your profits for hard currency\* 

So they are going to make sure we can't cash out, that's always been their plan, abuse Offramps with Chainalysis & warrantless surveilance, and bully UN countries with threats of Treasury Designation.

I believe ultimately we need something like Strike, something people in developing nations can use to send actual currency to banks in the US and EU, that peer to peer bank transfers between emerging markets and the West need to be normalized. To in effect, normalize OTC transactions of crypto outside of these hellish ""approved market places"" in the West.",118.0,2022-10-15 15:27:28,0.86

And we are only becoming more reliant upon them. See Strike for Bitcoin or even things like Alchemy, OpenSea, Binance, AWS, or the APIs.

If the tools are centralized than what good does it do if the base is decentralized? OpenSea can just de-list your NFT or Alchemy can block access to certain dapps. Than why even use a decentralized blockchain if it's not actually ""decentralized""

DeFi isn’t hard to learn. People simply never had to understand ROIs and APYs. The banks used to do all the work for us.,"DeFi always comes off as “complicated” and “hard to learn” but the reality is it’s not nearly as hard of a concept as traditional finance is. In fact, I’d argue that it’s much simpler.

However, we never really needed to understand how finance works in the first place because that has always been the job of the banks and financial institutions. This is how they were able to get away with scamming so many people with hard to pay loans like the notorious student loans and new car loans.

But because there isn’t any centralized authority to take care of the processes needed to complete DeFi transactions, we need to do everything on our own which means that we need to learn every single detail needed to finish said transactions without f-ing up.

It is extremely important for the Ethereum community to fully understand this because a lot of people (especially the newbies) are very intimidated by DeFi and end up resorting to centralized finance instead, which overall hurts the DeFi space.

DeFi is starting to become more and more user-friendly with many dApps like AAVE and Curve improving the UI and UX.

It’s also becoming developer-friendly which I think is of major significance for multiple reasons. zkEVMs will be game changers for developers and the one Polygon launched yesterday is proof. Devs can now use their zkEVM to migrate contracts and simply copy paste their code with ease. The fact that it’s open source also gives it more room for improvement.

And it’s not just them, other L2s like Loopring and Scroll are also working on launching zkEVMs. In fact ZkSync already has a zkEVM testnet. The only problem with it is that its closed source or simply doesnt exist.  
But regardless, all of this combined effort from these L2s will give developers much better building tools and techniques all of which directly impacts the user experience.  


I hope that with the developers’ jobs becoming easier and simpler, the average user will start seeing a difference in the DeFi space with an increased user experience.

I bet that even a decent number of those who use DeFi still dont fully understand how it works and that will definitely be a problem if we ever want to go mainstream.

The reason these banks and financial institutions became popular and eventually became an integral part of society and the economy is because of the ease of use they provide, and I think DeFi developers should learn from this and work their hardest to make imitate this one way or another even though I know its an extremely hard job to do.",140.0,2022-10-12 08:27:19,0.79
Vitalik’s view on zkEVM and its impact on Ethereum’s future as a blockchain:,"I’ve already posted a similar post here although it didn’t contain as much detail so I’m expanding on this one and going into further detail

There’s been a flurry of recent developments in the zero-knowledge sector on Ethereum with some L2s even launching zkEVM testnets which enticed me to rewrite about this subject.

Again, ZK is still incredibly new tech and not many fully understand it (and this is normal considering it’s a very complicated concept to fully grasp)

Although getting to understand the technology entirely involves complicated coding knowledge and references that not many will understand, I’ll try my best to break down the tech without delving too deep into complex terminology

A couple of months back Vitalik shared his thoughts about zkEVMs and the difference that comes with each level. So let’s dissect his thoughts into a somehow-brief post so that people on this sub better understand ZK tech and zkEVM:

We need to first understand the different levels that zkEVMs come in and how each level has its own pros and cons

# -Type 1 (fully Ethereum-equivalent):

Type 1 ZK-EVMs strive to be fully and uncompromisingly Ethereum-equivalent.

***The pros:***

Devs don’t have to double check the code when they migrate contracts. They can literally just copy paste

***The cons:***

Firstly, this creates a sort of laziness for devs because regardless of whether there’s 100% equivalence or not, a good dev should always double check their work

The second and more important disadvantage is that it is extremely slow compared to other types of zkEVMs. “Ethereum was not originally designed around ZK-friendliness, so there are many parts of the Ethereum protocol that take a large amount of computation to ZK-prove. Type 1 aims to replicate Ethereum exactly, and so it has no way of mitigating these inefficiencies” Vitalik concluded.

# -Type 2 (fully EVM-equivalent):

“Type 2 ZK-EVMs strive to be exactly EVM-equivalent, but not quite Ethereum-equivalent” Vitalik said. This basically means that from a developer’s point of view, a Type 2 zkEVM looks and acts exactly like Ethereum but with underlying minute changes. These changes are there to make the development process much easier and extremely faster than what Type 1 zkEVM would offer.

This is the main difference. Its basically there to solve the main issue of Ethereum being slow and inefficient but not altering the Ethereum code (at least not entirely)

Some major names developing such tech are Polygon and Zksync (although they differ slightly)

Polygon actually just released their zkEVM testnet a couple of hours ago which was one of the reasons that made me revisit this subject.

So now both Polygon and Zksync have zkEVM testnets but I think it’s known by now that I’m one to lean more towards Polygo for multiple reasons

First of all, Polygon’s zkEVM testnet is fully open source meaning that literally anyone can access it and even improve upon it.

Zksync’s zkEVM, although an impressive feat, is still closed source which I think completely defeats the purpose of a zkEVM in the first place

Another reason is that Polygon’s zkEVM is at Bytecode-level which is unlike any other zkEVM as of now. To shorten this and not get too technical, a Bytecode-level zkEVM aims to interpret EVM Bytecode. Polygon Hermez is currently bytecode equivalent. They run that bytecode using a custom zkASM of their own. This enables direct compatibility with already existing dApps. Those dApps should be able to run without any sort of problem since they are completely bytecode equivalent (not Ethereum equivalent though). This would be extra work for the nodes to put in to validate and write the block that isn't equivalent but it really shouldn’t be a problem.

Scroll and Consensys are also working on Bytecode equivalent zkEVMs however they’re still a work in progress.

***The pros:***

This type of zkEVM is much faster than the first type we talked about. It is more than 99% equivalent with Ethereum so it's safe to say that they are **\*\*almost\*\*** (but not entirely) the same which would make things much easier for devs to work with compared to the next types that I will talk about in a bit

***The cons:***

Remember how I said that this type is more than 99% compatible with Ethereum? Well, that extra 1% is modifications that are there to improve prover time.

The main drawback however is that while these modifications do indeed improve said prover time, they also do not solve every problem. The slowness from having to prove the EVM as-is, with all of the inefficiencies and ZK-unfriendliness inherent to the EVM, still remains.

# -Type 3 (almost EVM-equivalent):

This type is very similar to the previously mentioned type 2 however it sacrifices even more equivalence in order to improve prover times even more

***The pros:***

Faster than the previously mentioned

***The cons:***

A Type 3 ZK-EVM aims to be compatible with **\*\*most\*\*** applications. They require very minimal rewriting for the rest. However, there will always be applications that need to be completely rewritten.

# -Type 4 (high-level-language equivalent)

This type of EVM is arguably the most popular right now.

What it basically means is that it takes a high level coding language (like Vyper or Solidity) and transpile it down to a SNARK-friendly VM.

A close analogy would be finding two languages of similar roots (Spanish and Portuguese) and translating one to another.

Some of the major names that use this type of EVM are Matterlabs, and Starkware.

***The pros:***

Extremely fast prover times.

“There is a lot of overhead that you can avoid by not ZK-proving all the different parts of each EVM execution step, and starting from the higher-level code directly” as Vitalik noted about this type of EVM

***The cons:***

This type of EVM can’t compile all sorts of applications. This means that developers will have to rewrite A LOT of smart contracts and code them back from scratch.

I think I’ll end the post here. There are of course many more details to be studied and talked about however I’m pretty sure that not many would be familiar with the keywords and I personally think that this is more than enough for a normal Ethereum user to get a general idea of what zkEVM is and what it does

Delving deeper into detail would be overkill unless you’re a developer or want to be one. If that’s the case then sure knock yourself out and study more about Ethereum, Bytecode, zkEVM, and Solidity

I really hope that this post helps some of you in the community understand and appreciate Ethereum and the various L2s trying to improve the blockchain.

Gensler is more akin to a trojan horse; but, that would require the SEC to be a crypto-friendly group in the first place.

Its only a matter of time before they strike a firm blow against a significant amount of cryptos. The CFTC continues to say that $ETH and $BTC are commodities; but, the majority of cryptos are up-in-the-air. Gensler and the SEC will eventually set their sights on the banks' competitors. He isn't there to work for the people. He is there to work with legislators and law enforcement on behalf of the banks. It is plainly evident in his speeches and in the classes he taught at MIT.

"If everyone actually went though the hassle of learning about DeFi, we wouldn’t have CeFi in the first place","Sure, for now, we still need centralized exchanges for on-ramping and off-ramping. But that doesn’t justify why CeFi TVL is so freaking huge when DeFi is a way more superior means of finance.

CeFi works in a way that is completely opposite to what crypto was created to serve in the first place.

The reason cryptocurrencies became a thing 13 years ago was to get rid of central authority controlling our capital the way they see fit.

By investing in centralized finance, we’re literally making the concept of crypto irrelevant.

But still, people invest in CeFi anyway because they’re either too intimidated or too lazy to learn about DeFi in the first place. Sure, there are many complicated things to learn about and mistakes are usually irreversible but once you get the hang of it you have full access to the benefits that DeFi can provide all of which isn’t available with CeFi.

Then there are people who talk about how CeFi has cheaper fees but I think this argument is slowly becoming more and more irrelevant and redundant simply because L2s are doing a great job scaling the DeFi space and are only getting better day by day.  


Many of the major DeFi applications are resorting to L2s.  
Some of the most popular ones are Polygon, housing over 37,000 dApps with some like AAVE, Curve, Uniswap, and Quickswap.

They’re all benefiting from all the scaling solutions offered by Polygon.

Overall, DeFi is just superior to CeFi in every shape or form so it doesn’t make sense for so many people to use CeFi.

The main reason they do so is exactly as mentioned in the title. They don’t want to go through the hassle of learning even though it ends up paying off incredibly.",30.0,2022-10-08 00:16:26,0.7
"Major universities like Harvard, Oxford, and MIT are entering the Web3 scene through Ethereum DAOs. Mainstream adoption is just getting started","I know that these universities aren’t available for the average person like you and I but this signifies an interest from academic institutions in blockchain and Web3. This is a major start and could spark into something bigger in the later months and years.

These are the most important and prestigious universities in the world after all and thus have a major impact and influence on other universities.

Harvard Blockchain, Blockchain at Berkeley, Blockchain at Michigan, Berkley RDI, MIT Sloan Blockchain and Oxford Blockchain Society all chose to build their courses on Ethereum through EduDAO all of which is being funded by Bitdao.

The fact that BitDAO, an Ethereum based DAO is funding these educational courses is huge! This is EXACTLY what Vitalik dreamed of in the first place.

Yeah you could technically build anything on Ethereum from memes, to NFTs, to dApps, but Vitalik’s main priority was for Ethereum to serve us and further us as humans.

If more universities start following suit and this becomes some sort of a trend, mainstream adoption will be closer than we really thought.

Think about it this way. The students learning in these universities will soon become the working members of this society and will be the ones controlling how our society is heading.

If they’re predisposed to blockchain and Web3 at a young age then the chances of them using the advantages that come with such technology drastically increases which will most likely push crypto and blockchain into the mainstream light.",707.0,2022-10-07 19:08:49,0.92

I live in a part of the world where staking/rewards on Coinbase and other CEX is not allowed/available.  I'd like to stake it on a DeFi platform and which remains in my custody.

Rising to power and maintaining that power are two completely different yet equally hard tasks. And Ethereum is doing both tasks perfectly,"What helped bring Ethereum to these heights is its exceptional and unparalleled ecosystem. And in my opinion, the thing keeping Ethereum in these heights are L2s

The reason I stress on the importance of L2s is because Ethereum is stuck in a dilemma.

The more successful and popular Ethereum becomes, the more users and activities it will acquire daily. But that in turn will slow down the network which would then make it lose users and activity.

With L2s being introduced, this issue is slowly but surely fading into obscurity day by day.

This is the main reason why the Ethereum development team ended up changing the roadmap to one that focuses a lot of L2s being implemented into the network.

 We’re already seeing unprecedented development for L2s especially the zero-knowledge sector.

A lot of L2s are focusing on ZK especially ones like Polygon after they started developing their open source zkEVM. Yet they still have other solutions that focus on Optimistic rollups as well.

These L2s have proven to be extremely popular as well considering that the aforementioned Polygon is currently nearing 175 million unique addresses.

Technically speaking, Ethereum will never escape Vitalik’s trilemma, but practically speaking, L2s will act as an outside extension to help solve this problem.

What L2s will do ensure that Ethereum keeps its high level of decentralization and security while still being fast and cheap.

The main thing pushing people away from DeCi is that you need weeks of research to merely start understanding it. But with CeFi anyone can start right away.,"I’m a HUGE advocate for using DeFi on Ethereum as I think CeFi has completely opposite fundamentals from what crypto was initially created for, yet a lot of people still use it simply because it’s much easier.

A lot of people (especially newcomers to Ethereum) feel very intimidated by DeFi and the many things that one would need to learn about before starting that journey.

Impermanent loss, liquidity pools, flash loans, oracles, and everything in between. These are things that some people take weeks and even months to fully learn about and understand, so a lot of these people end up using centralized finance instead because it does the job for them.

That ease of use and user friendliness comes at a cost though and that is loss of custody and control over funds on the platform.

But none the less, this intimidation is definitely standing in the way of DeFi’s growth.

Another argument would be that CeFi fees are way lower but I think this argument grew irrelevant with time since more and more Ethereum based swaps and DEXs started building on L2s and commit chains.

 We’ve all seen the boost in DeFi that some commit chains like Polygon ended up providing with the inclusion of swaps and DEXs including some like Quickswap, Uniswap, Meshswap, and 1inch.

These swaps and DEXs rival CEXs in terms of speed and affordability but we yet again go back to the problem of user friendliness. And while the ones I mentioned lean more toward the more user friendly experience, most DeFi platforms on the market aren’t.

You simply can use these platforms before you do a decent amount of research especially when there’s a lot of money involved.

If we don’t start seeing new development in the UI sector and user friendly experience from the entirety of the DeFi market, we might not be able to reach any form of mainstream adoption.",39.0,2022-10-01 03:39:16,0.75
Question About Apparent Censorship,"
[This article is saying that 45% of Eth validators are complying with US sanctions](https://cointelegraph.com/news/45-of-eth-validators-now-complying-with-us-sanctions-labrys-ceo). This is concerning, because it's so soon after the merge, and it's very much something that people said could happen. 

Someone here said that the function of block proposing / construction was going to be separated out from validation, in such a way that the validator can't know in advance which transactions are included. How far away is that from being rolled out?

Are the lead devs talking about this or concerned about it? I really want to like Eth. It seems like it's come such a long way over the years, but this kind of censorship seems like a big deal, and something that could be come a big problem in the not so distant future.",97.0,2022-09-30 22:58:12,0.84
"PoW vs PoS $225,907,500 Savings So Far","Hello Redditors,

I was reviewing the status of Ethereum today after the merge, it's been 14 days and wanted to see how we are doing.

I was using [https://ultrasound.money/](https://ultrasound.money/) to check on the supply of Ethereum and compare supply before and after merge.

If we were still on PoW we would have produced 180,329 Ethereum. Since we moved to PoS we have produced 8,554 Ethereum instead.

Doing some math using today's prices, say $1300 per Ethereum.

180,329 \* 1300 = $237,027,700 (PoW production of Ethereum)

8,554     \* 1300 = $11,120,200   (PoS   production of Ethereum)

11,120,200  - 237,027,700 = - $225,907,500.

What this tells me is that since the merge, Ethereum would have normally produced an additional $225,907,500 to it's market cap, which is usually collected by miners and maybe sold on exchanges. That's only in 14 days.

This is massive with the current state of things.

I believe the next bull run is going to be massive when the supply actually starts going negative combined with stackers trying to stake more to get higher rewards, just like what we saw with miners fighting over GPUs pushing the price of GPUs to the moon, stackers will be fighting over Ethereum coins.

What are your thoughts? Did I make any mistakes or overlook something?

Nothing posted here is financial advice. This is only for entertainment purposes.

Thoughts on Vitalik's L3 article,"As always, Vitalik's articles are super interesting and tightly-packed with good information:  
[https://vitalik.ca/general/2022/09/17/layer\_3.html](https://vitalik.ca/general/2022/09/17/layer_3.html)  


One of the uses he briefly describes, for L3,  is "" **L2 is for general-purpose scaling, L3 is for customized scaling**."". Though it might sound simple at first, I think this phrase hides deep and important implications  
C*ustomized scaling* is likely the most promising use of L3. One can enable exceedingly higher computational loads with application-specific rollup chains because of *local consensus*. Such application chains (in contrast to traditional sidechains) would use the general-purpose base layer (L2) for dispute resolution, thus deriving the security of the base layer, through a 1-of-N security model.

The shift from global to local (or application-specific) consensus affects how DApps relate to each other. This design *might* come at the cost of higher friction to composability, but that is a concern that is irrelevant for a broad class of applications. 

On the other hand, applications gain the ability to function without competing cannibalistically for the computer power of validators. It is possible to avoid network gentrification and ensure that things outside DeFi survive.  


In particular, applications that run on their own optimistic rollup chains with interactive fraud proofs (as compared to ZK rollups) can support computational loads comparable to mainstream (e.g.,  involving billions of instruction steps and large memory address spaces). It would enable a new class of decentralized applications that use alternative VM architectures running complex decentralized logic with mainstream software stacks. 

Being able to customize the app chain and choose the profile of validators is also a plus. Maybe everyone that cares about a cool decentralized MMORPG has a beefy computer that can process a bunch of stuff. You also get to customize the sequencer per application, maybe a DEX could forsake market maker fees for computation.   


Thoughts shared by [https://twitter.com/erickdemoura](https://twitter.com/erickdemoura) on twitter.   


What do you think? I totally agree that we're overusing global consensus and neglecting this idea of leveraging the 1-of-N security model to ""localize"" consensus and customize scaling.",22.0,2022-09-29 14:46:05,0.8

Mainstream adoption is still far from reach considering the vast majority of the world's populous still doesn’t know about crypto. But the way I see it, it might not take that long for us to reach mainstream status if we keep up this pace.

More and more of the younger age are starting to enter the working class and influencing the world and economies.

A lot of these people use and connect with the brands and networks I just mentioned (Instagram, Starbucks, Disney) all of which are starting to build a Web3 identity for themselves on Ethereum.

The fact that these billion-dollar companies chose an Ethereum L2 to be their “launchpad” speaks a lot especially since it’s happening during a bear market. This means that they’re not in it for the money, but they see a vision in Ethereum and Polygon.

This is all an indication that we’re just getting started. If you give up hope now because of bad sentiment then you aren’t looking at the full picture.

For the past \~6 months, contributors have been building the KZG Ceremony, a pre-req for protodanksharding / EIP-4844. Hopefully, in 2 weeks we'll be collecting a community contribution from the mainstage audience at EFDevcon! 👀 learn more: [github.com/ethereum/kzg-ceremony](https://github.com/ethereum/kzg-ceremony)

these Ceremonies have been called other names as well: Trusted Setup, Parameter Generation Event, Powers of Tau. Projects like aleoHQ, Zcash, Filecoin, CeloOrg, privacyscaling, tornadocash, 0xPolygonHermez, + others have all used these to add privacy or consensus improvements

Ethereum will be using it to enable scalability. In a ""rollup-centric"" world, getting cheap data (EIP-4844) to rollups is important! 🚀 Here's Vitalik's summary of what the ceremony generally involves (key: only 1 honest participant needed!) [https://vitalik.ca/general/2022/03/14/trustedsetup.html](https://vitalik.ca/general/2022/03/14/trustedsetup.html)

>That is to say, **hundreds of people participate in generating the data together, and only one of them needs to be honest and not publish their secret for the final output to be secure. Well-executed setups like this are often considered ""close enough to trustless"" in practice**.

Our ceremony will:

* be browser-based (accessible, no large files to download)
* only take \~2 min to complete
* aim to have the largest set ever (5k+ contribs)
* provide an easy to audit transcript (output summary of all contribs, which proves the ceremony is legit)

So far we've written the spec, main implementation, and gotten them both audited 🙌 Next, we will be finishing the sequencer + interface, testing that all the components work well & organizing addtl security reviews. 🤞 If timing works out, we'll see you onstage at u/EFDevcon!

Post Devcon, there will be a public contribution period (\~2 months) where anyone can add their randomness to the ceremony 🎲 This is a great way for anyone to participate in building crucial Ethereum infra primitives 🛠 all you'll need is a desktop browser and a few minutes!

Check out the resources listed here if you want to dig into the context / design [https://github.com/ethereum/kzg-ceremony](https://github.com/ethereum/kzg-ceremony).

## FATCA (Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act)

FATCA is the acronym for the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act, a law approved by the US Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and the US Treasury Department on 18 March 2010 to promote the tax transparency and encourage compliance by US persons with their tax obligations.

FATCA requires financial institutions around the world to identify those clients who are United State persons who have – among others – financial accounts in foreign countries that must be reported annually to the US tax authorities. To ensure compliance with FATCA, a 30% withholding will be applied to certain payments made to entities and people who do not comply with this regulation.

All Andorran banks are financial institutions and as such are obligated to comply with these regulations.

Due to the extraterritorial scope of this law, the United States has adopted an intergovernmental approach that consists of entering into bilateral agreements (Intergovernmental Agreement or IGA) with certain countries. Under these bilateral agreements, FATCA regulations are transposed into the internal laws of the signatory country in order to facilitate the practical enforcement of FATCA obligations.

There is currently no IGA between the United States and the Principality of Andorra. To this end, every Andorran bank must sign the FATCA agreement with the IRS and each one is subject to the fulfilment of the obligations arising therefrom.

In general, the obligations imposed by FATCA on Andorran banks are as follows:

1. Registration on the IRS website set up for this purpose.
2. Identification of any US Person who has an account with the bank and falls into any of the following categories:

* Citizens or legal residents of the United States. Not only US persons who reside in the US but also those who possess American citizenship, regardless of where they live, are bound by US tax laws.
* Companies incorporated in the United States or owned by one or more US Persons who exercise control of the company.

1. The following information on the financial accounts of clients identified as US Persons must be reported to the IRS annually:

* Personal information: name, address and US tax identification number (US TIN).
* Financial information such as the account number, the year-end balance, closed accounts, final balances and income earned on the account.

Financial accounts are understood as deposit, custody, and equity accounts and some insurance policies.

1. The withholding rules even apply to financial institutions that have not signed a FATCA agreement and clients with fiscal obligations in the United States who do not provide their information willingly or do not consent to report their information to the IRS (recalcitrant clients).

SEC claims the US govt has jurisdiction over all Ethereum network transactions now that ETH has transitioned to proof-of-stake & the majority of nodes being run are in the US. Do you think the SEC might eventually sue ETH like it did XRP for unlawfully issuing securities?,"Ethereum \[ETH\] has been one of the most-talked about cryptocurrencies over the past few weeks, with major updates like the Merge taking place. Apart from this, the network’s transition into proof-of-stake \[PoS\] has been fueling rumors about ETH being categorized as a security. Now, further strengthening this argument, the SEC in a lawsuit against crypto influencer Ian Balina claimed that ETH transactions automatically fall under the US government’s jurisdiction due to the majority of nodes being run in the country.

Balina was sued for allegedly offering unregistered tokens. He was caught in trouble after he failed to register his project as a security before rolling out an initial coin offering \[ICO\] in 2018. The crypto influencer outrightly denied these claims. However, the crypto community is currently speculating on SEC’s massive statement in the lawsuit. According to the 69th paragraph, the lawsuit stated that it had the right to sue Balina because the SEC had jurisdiction over the Ethereum network.

It was reported that a variety of U.S.-based investors participated in the Balina-curated investment pool. A network of Ethereum blockchain nodes further verified a number of ETH contributions. Due to this, the SEC stated,

“ETH contributors were validated by a network of nodes on the Ethereum blockchain, which are clustered more densely in the United States than in any other country. As a result, those transactions took place in the United States.”

Additionally, it should be noted that at present 42.56 percent or 3340 of the 7819 Ethereum nodes reside in the US.

**Will this statement take a toll on the Ethereum network?**

The Ethereum network has been dealing with immense backlash following the Merge. As mentioned earlier, some were suggesting that the network would fall under the SEC’s purview as it would now be considered a security. A few others on the other hand were taking digs at ETH’s level of decentralization.

Amidst all of this, the latest statement made by the SEC would be detrimental to the network. Even though several legal professionals noted that the complaint’s phrasing would have no legal significance, it would nevertheless be noticed.",108.0,2022-09-20 13:29:45,0.81
Is Ethereum a Security?,"Found this on the Web - [https://isethereumasecurity.com/](https://isethereumasecurity.com/)

# Is Ethereum a Security?

The question of if Ethereum is a security has been a topic of hot debate, especially as Ethereum transitioned to “Proof-of-Stake” a model in which users stake their Ether on a validator and take part in rewards for validating the network.In order to answer if Ethereum is a security, at least in the eyes of US regulators, we must view it through the lens of a test known as the “*Howey Test*” which is a **three-pronged**[1](https://isethereumasecurity.com/#fn:1) that determines if Ethereum is a security.It should be noted that *all* three prongs of the test must be met for something to be deemed a security.We can review the elements of the test individually:

## 1. An investment of money:

Prong #1 is simple and does not require debate. Ethereum **does** meet this criteria in a Proof-of-Stake model and requires a user buying or acquiring Ethereum to take part in staking.

The word “*money*” does not negate or by-pass this prong.

The case “*State V Gopher Tire and Rubber Co*”[2](https://isethereumasecurity.com/#fn:2) the court notes that “*laying out of capital in a way intended to secure income or employement*” is sufficient to meet this prong.

It is also noted in “*Uselton v. Commercial Lovelace Motor Freight*”[3](https://isethereumasecurity.com/#fn:3) the court expressly found that the “*investment of money*” can take the forms of “*goods or services*” or another “*exchange of value*.”

Lastly, in “*SEC v. Shavers*”[4](https://isethereumasecurity.com/#fn:4) the court expressly found that Bitcoin and other digital currencies could meet the standard of “an investment of *money*.”

**Status:** Meets this Prong

## 2. In a common enteprise:

In order to review this prong one needs to understand:

* [Common Enterprise](https://isethereumasecurity.com/CommonEnterprise.html)
* [Ethereum Validation](https://isethereumasecurity.com/EthereumValidation.html)
* [Ethereum Rewards & Penalties](https://isethereumasecurity.com/EthereumRewardsAndPenalties.html)

The short summary of the Ethereum Validation system is:

* Your funds are not pooled with other stakers.
* If your validator is [*slashed*](https://isethereumasecurity.com/#) only you receive a penalty.
* Penalties take place if are offline too long (failed technical effort) or if you are malicious.
* You are only rewarded based on the role of your validator.
* Validators are rewarded for reporting slashable offenses, making them adversarial and not communal.
* Individual block proposers profit from extended effort such as MEV that is not shared by others.In line which each framing of common enterprise:

## Horizontal Commonality:

As outlined in “*Revak v SEC Realty Corp*”[5](https://isethereumasecurity.com/#fn:5) the court looks for “*the pro-rata distribution of profits*” and the “*tying together of investors assets, via the pooling of funds*.”

In “*Hart v. Pulte Homes of Michigan Corp*”[6](https://isethereumasecurity.com/#fn:6) and “*Salcer v. Merrill Lync, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Inc*”[7](https://isethereumasecurity.com/#fn:7) the courts expressly suggest that the “*investment* ***must*** *be part of a pooled group of funds*.”

And in “*Milnarik v M-S Commodities*”[8](https://isethereumasecurity.com/#fn:8) it is noted that “*the success or failure of other contracts must have a direct impact on the profitability of plantiffs contracts*.”

Since our Ethereum is not pooled and a validators profit or penalty is derived solely from their performance and does not impact other validators, we can conclude there is not “*Horizontal Commonality*.”

## Vertical Commonality:

As outlined in “*SEC v. Glenn W Turner Enters Inc*”[9](https://isethereumasecurity.com/#fn:9) vertical commonality requires the investors profits are “*tied inextricably to the efficacy of the promoter*”

In “*Villeneuve v. Advanced Bus Concepts Corp*”[10](https://isethereumasecurity.com/#fn:10) its noted that “*the fortunes of investors need be linked only to the efforts of the promoter*” and in “*Long v. Shultz Cattle Co*”[11](https://isethereumasecurity.com/#fn:11) expanded to note that it requires only that the “*fortunes of invesntors be tied to the fortunes of the promoters*.”

First there is the challenge that it is not likely that there is grounds to find that there is an “Ethereum Promoter” any more under the definition of this role. Yet, that is novel legal precedent that would need to be tested.

Instead, if we assume the Ethereum creators were found to be “*Promoters*” for sake of the arguement, then the question is if their fortune is directly tied to the fortunes of the “investors.”

By contributing to Ethereum, developers do not expressly own part of the network unless they themselves purchased Ether. As such, they cannot be deemed to be a promoter.

**Commonality**

The only commonality arguement that exists is that there is some sort of “common enterprise” among validators running the network, and a cooperative mechanic between validators validating a transaction. However, as those are distinct and post facto to the development of the networks code, these validators cannot sufficiently be found to be “promoters” in any established sense of the term.

**Status:** Does not this Prong

## 3. An expectation of profit, derived from the efforts of others:

The final prong of the Howey Test is if the investor can have “*an expectation of profit,* ***derived from*** *the efforts of others*.”

As outlined in “[How Many Prongs Are In The Howey Test?](https://isethereumasecurity.com/ProngsOfHoweyTest.html)” it is important to note that this clause is a compound because:

* Users are allowed to expect profit, and,
* The common enterprise may have efforts of others.
* But, the **profit** must not be derived from the efforts of others.

In “*United Housing Foundation v. Forman*”[12](https://isethereumasecurity.com/#fn:12) the courts expressly noted that the core of this is based “*on a reasonable expectation of profits to be derived from the entrepreneurial or mangerial efforts of others*.”

This requires that we must not only expect profit, but the profit we expect must be from the efforts of others and not be from our own efforts or goods.

In “*US v. Holtzclaw*”[13](https://isethereumasecurity.com/#fn:13) a church bought into a program to resell gold certificates from the “Sell America” program, the courts found that a multi-level marketing program was not a security for the aggreved party, as they only earned from sales resulting from their own efforts.

While the “*efforts of others*” were absolutely needed in order for their to be profit (Sell America had to acquire gold, issue certificates, create a system to sell and register those and redeem them) the profit expected did not stem from those efforts and **required** the efforts of the investor party to be selling.

As mentioned in the summary of [Ethereum Validation](https://isethereumasecurity.com/EthereumValidation.html) and [Ethereum Rewards & Penalties](https://isethereumasecurity.com/EthereumRewardsAndPenalties.html), we know that:

* Validators must use their own technical expertise to maintain adequate technology and uptime.
* Their validator is *only* rewarded when it takes part in validation.
* Their validator only earns a reward or penalty, for itself, based on its own actions.
* A validtor can increase their earnings, and only their earnings through implementing MEV strategies.
* Validators can increase their earnings by reporting bad validators in the set, making clear that the validator “committee” is not a common enterprise with profits tied to each other, but instead an seperate and adverseral set of vendors.
* In theory a single validator could be rewarded if no other validator took part in the process, showing there is not a dependence on actions of others.

Ultimately this prong of the Howey Test posits the question “*What are you being rewarded for?*.”

In the Ethereum network, you as a validator are not rewarded on the basis that the Ethereum developers continue to develop.

Validators are selling “*reliable participation*”, they are rewarded for being available and accurate. We know this because a validator is [*slashed*](https://isethereumasecurity.com/#) when it has excessive downtime, or its trust becomes deficient and it is slashed on an individual level.

If we are rewarded for “*reliable participation*” and slashed when and only when we have either downtime or lose trust, then this must be what is for sale.

The question then becomes is the effort of maintaining that “*reliable participation*” by maintaining a validator sufficient that we are being clearly rewarded for our own individual actions rather than the efforts of others?

We believe the SEC has indirectly answered that for us already in “*SEC v. Homero Joshua Garza*”[14](https://isethereumasecurity.com/#fn:14) in which Garza was charged with violating section 5a of the Securities Law Act of 1933.

In this case, the SEC viewed that owning and managing Bitcoin mining rigs/servers *was* a managerial effort, and that selling access to their future earnings was therefore a matter of expectation of profit at the efforts of others and thus a security.

Therefore we believe it is undeniable that the maintaining of an Ethereum validator which has the additional burden and complexity of uptime and accuracy requirements, should also be viewed as the key managerial effort, and therefore does not meet this prong.

**Status:** Does not this Prong

## Summary:

**Prong #2:**

* Hard to suggest there is an “*issuer*” or “*promoter*” at this point in Ethereum.
* Staking does not have horizontal commonality in relation to profits.
* Staking does have some horizontal commonality in relation to other validators, but they are not an issuer/promoter.
* Horziontal commonality in efforts is negated by the factor that the profits and loses are solely based on your own validators performance and actions.
* Your validator can be taken to another network is not locked in to any type of commonality.
* Staking does not have strong vertical commonality with the issuer.
* There is only broad vertical commonality, if you believe what is being sold is blockspace, and that the blockspace is owned by developers who publish code, but do not run the network.

**Prong #3:**

* There is an expectation of profits.
* Those profits are only derived from your own ability to maintain a reliable validator.
* The maintenance of a machine performing network validation has been shown to be a key managerial effort in the past.
* You are selling uptime and validation, and not blockspace, as your validator could connect to another PoS network, or fork, with other validators and do the same action.

This would mean finding Ethereum Proof-of-Stake to not be a security.

Expect at least a year before you start seeing lower gas. The merge won’t reduce gas fees but it’s the first step in doing so.,"A decent number of people were expecting gas fees to quickly and suddenly decrease right after the merge, but that is far from the truth.

Technically, moving to PoS does register a very tiny decrease in gas fees, but that change is basically negligible.  
The only thing that changes for now is energy consumption which will see a huge 99.9% decrease.

If you’re waiting for gas fees to become low, you’re going to have to wait at least a year from now until sharding gets implemented.

Even then, Ethereum itself won’t be cheap and never will if devs stick to the current roadmap.  
What Sharding will do is facilitate a groundwork for EVM compatible L2s to help scale Ethereum.  
And with enough time and upgrades down the line, L2s will basically become a part of Ethereum itself. They’ll be indistinguishable.

Implementing scalability into the Ethereum chain itself would have taken a lot more time, energy, and resources.  
Meanwhile, L2s have been doing this for a while and they have the facilities, flexibility, and infrastructure to keep developing better ways to scale Ethereum.

Ethereum would need to a lot more time to test out scalability since a ton of private funds are on the line. Meanwhile, an L2 like Polygon for example has been doing this for years and they even have the groundwork for it. They have an entire data availability scaling solution which is the entire focus of sharding in the first place.

Sharding is officially slated for mid 2023 but considering that mishaps and extra testing might be happening especially after the delays that we experienced with the merge, I’m expecting sharding to get rolled out at least end of 2023

But that’s okay because current L2s are already doing a great job honestly but sharding will be the nail in the coffin for any criticism regarding Ethereum and I’m here to see all of that unroll.",54.0,2022-09-18 15:13:56,0.72

How Realistic is the Centralisation Risk of PoS?,"A popular criticism following the Merge is that 4 entities own 64% of validator nodes. 3 of these are exchanges (Coinbase, Kraken and Binance) which are centralised and they'll have to adhere to wallet blacklists sent by the government.

SCAM alert! Beware of the new ETHW and ETHPoW coins created on the main Ethereum POS chain.,"TLD: Pairs containing ETHW or ETHPoW at DEXs like Uniswap are likely to be scams.

The core devs of Ethereum are moving away from the POW chain to the POS chain, but that doesn't mean that the POW chain has to die. With this in mind the new POW chain will have the token renamed to ETHW or ETHPoW. The POS chain will keep the ETH name for its token.

BUT, I'm seeing tons of ETHW and ETHPoW created on the POS chain, meaning that these are likely to be scams. These are already trading in Uniswap and other Dex and I'm 99% sure they are scams.

For these not to be scams will have to be backed from some sort of bridge between the two chains which is unlikely to exist today considering that the fork has happened just now and the old POW chain is under reorganisation (or not).

**Frequently Asked Questions**

**Where's the best place to buy ETH?**

There are many centralized exchanges that support Ethereum. If you live in the US, the most popular exchanges are Coinbase, Gemeni and Kraken. Coinbase users can use Coinbase Pro for lower fees.

**When is Eth2 launching?**

Eth2 is a marketing term used to represent a number of updates to Ethereum. The Eth2 proof-of-stake chain first launched in December 2020. ""The Merge"", which is the event that will fully switch Ethereum's consensus to proof-of-stake, is estimated to be ready in early 2022, although there is no exact timeline. Other updates, such as data shards, will follow that update.

Visit [ethmerge.com](https://ethmerge.com/) to learn more about ""The Merge"".

**Do I need to do anything to update to Eth2? Will Eth2 create a new token?**

No, ETH holders *never* need to take any action to keep holding ETH. Ethereum users will be unaffected by the Eth2 upgrade. And the Eth2 updates will not create any new tokens.

**How can I stake my ETH?**

The best way to stake your ETH: by running your own validator.

* Running your own validator requires a modern computer and 32 ETH. Visit /r/ethstaker for more details

**Why are Ethereum transaction fees so high?**

Like most blockchains, Ethereum fees are determined by supply-and-demand. The large demand to use Ethereum has pushed transaction fees quite high (however, fees were just a few cents only 2 years ago). Fees are especially high during market volatility, and during NFT drops.

**What is being done to lower Ethereum transaction fees?**

Ethereum fees are reduced by using layer-2 rollups. Rollups are scaling solutions that allow for significantly cheaper transactions, while still maintaining Ethereum's security.

Additionally, Eth2's data shards will make rollups even cheaper.

While rollups are cutting-edge technology being actively developed, a number are already live on Ethereum mainnet. Visit [l2beat.com](https://l2beat.com/) to learn more about rollups.

**What's the best wallet for Ethereum?**

The most popular tool for using decentralized applications is Metamask. However, for security reasons, we recommend using a hardware wallet such as a Trezor or Ledger.

Ethereum APY reaches 6.15%+ on AAVE - a massive milestone in Crypto that can open the floodgate for institutional money in ETH and its ecosystem. Bullish flag for overall crypto! PERSPECTIVE,"ETH APY typically ranged from <1% (most of the time) to 1-2% often on AAVE but reaching 6.14% as of the time of writing this post is a pretty massive milestone!

That type of yield on the relatively most secured blockchain on a permission-less DeFi protocol (AAVE) can attract massive influx of institutional money. This was a big a reason for Solana's rise last year as institutions loved 6%+ yield on a well funded/ well backed project with stable and strong team. Now think about where Ethereum stands compared to Solana and what can a 6.15% APY unlock for it and its ecosystem. Merge itself is a big milestone for ETH but it is amazing to see that yield!

More power to ETH and its ecosystem. More power to entire Crypto universe!

Our heavy reliance on centralized exchanges will give governments much more leverage over us just like what happened with Tornado Cash,"Most of these centralized exchanges are US regulatory compliant, meaning they were forced to flag and seize accounts that were related in any sort to Tornado Cash.

Now this wouldn’t be a problem is we all used DEXs but the vast majority of the crypto community owns a lot of money on the CEXs. This is exactly why it became a such a huge deal.

The US government would have close to no leverage if we all used DEXs. What can they do?

Ethereum developers, major crypto influencers and the entire community would simply not care and carry on with their lives.

This is exactly why I think DeFi and DAOs are the only way to go if we ever want to achieve complete self governance and financial freedom.

Why do people even use these CEXs? They have KYC plus DeFi and DAO have way better features to offer, self governance being the most important.

The only drawback is higher gas fees but that’s being solved by man L2s

Some like Zksync are even developing DAO specific scaling solutions like the one funded by Bitdao (ZkDAO) which will help reduce gas fees by a wide margin.  
I still don’t understand why we’re so heavily reliant on CEXs.

I know that TVL on DEXs is higher but that still doesn’t change the fact that TVL on CEXs is dangerously high to the point where governments can use it as leverage to enforce their rules on us and regulate the way they want.

Investing in a centralized exchange goes against everything that crypto stands for. The main reason crypto was created in the first place was for us to manage finances without have the government’s nose up out butt, yet somehow they now have our facial IDs and passports through KYC.

What is “data availability” and why is it the top priority for Ethereum’s development team right now? Let’s talk about it:,"# EDIT: I've previously posted about both the merge and Sharding. All of these subjects are related and intertwined so I would really suggest you give them a quick read

Objectively speaking, Ethereum by far has the top-tier ecosystem on the market with some of our favorite projects and dApps built on it.

However, Ethereum is also infamous for its high gas fees, slow transactions, and overall lack of scalability and efficiency.

One of the major reasons behind this problem is “data availability” or more precisely the lack of it.

In order to explain what “data availability” is, we first need to talk about Ethereum nodes and how and where they store data. We also need to discuss L2s a little bit so I’ll try to make this as easy as possible for the average Joe to understand.

# - What are Ethereum nodes?

Ethereum nodes are essentially a group of computers that keep a full and comprehensive record of every single activity that happens on the entire Ethereum blockchain.

This obviously takes up a HUGE amount of precious and expensive space and processing power which renders Ethereum quite inefficient.

The main issue here is that a lot of this stored data is not being used and will most likely never be used. But its still there non the less and will always be there even after merging and sharding are implemented.

# - What is data availability?

Data availability as a concept and practice is not something new. It has been around for a while. But things get complicated when blockchains are involved and thus this concept on Ethereum is still new and not fully implemented.

Data availability is the practice of storing data off of the operating system or network (in this case, the Ethereum blockchain) and only presenting the needed data at the needed time.

**Here’s a nice analogy:**

**Let’s say you work on a computer but that computer has so much data stored that it’s making it very slow and clunky in performance. You also realize that you don’t need ALL of the data at once yet you still want to keep that data just in case you ever needed it someday.**

**What you do is you end up storing said data on a designated computer or hard drive and only extract the information you need at the current moment thus relieving much of the strain on the computer you work on.**

Now, this process is a bit more complicated when blockchains and the billions of dollars of transactions and assets on them are involved because there should always be irrefutable evidence that the stored data is indeed there and isn’t being tampered with.

This is where L2s get involved.

# - How can L2s help with data availability?

After the merge is fully implemented and Sharding is introduced, L2s will gain a lot of extra throughput to process information and gain faster prover times.

As mentioned before, the Ethereum beacon chain itself won’t be scalable. This responsibility will fully lie on L2s some of which are already working on scaling solutions focused on data availability.

This is why I was focused on mentioning Polygon in all of my previous posts regarding the merge and sharding because they’re developing a data availability scaling solution (Polygon Avail) and they actually just released the testnet yesterday (it was part of the reason that made me compelled to write this post and explain the importance of data availability for the future of Ethereum

Scaling solutions like the one being developed by Polygon store all the massive counts of data off of the Ethereum chain and provide only the needed information at a given moment while still giving irrefutable proof that the entire compilation of the Ethereum database is indeed intact and untampered with.

# - Conclusion?

When we talk about dank sharding, we’re actually talking about multiple upgrades but the most important of them all is indeed data availability.

If Ethereum wants to stay secure and decentralized but also fix the scalability problem, then data availability should be the main focus (and it is).

I hope I was able to explain the importance of data availability in a way that the average Ethereum user can understand without getting into so much technical detail.

As per usual, I’d love your feedback in the comments and would happily answer any questions there as well!",75.0,2022-09-01 13:05:38,0.95
Why do you need blockchain for smart contracts?,"Sorry for this crazy basic question, but it's one that is bugging me.

The case for smart contracts has been around for decades. Nick Szabo's essay is well-known. He did not think about blockchain, only that one day interconnectedness will enable effective smart contracting with real-world applications.

I understand the difference between a blockchain and a centralised server.

I, for one, do not believe that the ""idealistic"" side of blockchain is enough to ensure its adoption. That idealistic side can usually be summed up as ""decentralised is better"" and I think it's, at the very least, debatable. But I am also not sure real businesses really care.

I understand the use case of smart contracts, smart contracting and machine contracting. I do believe there are fantastic applications for those.

But please can anyone give me a compelling argument for why you need the blockchain for this and not a very reliable centralised cloud provider?",26.0,2022-09-01 06:23:39,0.69
"To quote the Ethereum Foundation: “The Ethereum ecosystem is firmly aligned that Layer 2 scaling is the only way to solve the scalability trilemma while remaining decentralized and secure.""","I’ve been seeing a lot of people especially on subs like r/cc claim that “the merge will make L2s irrelevant” but this is simply NOT TRUE. In fact, the complete opposite is true and I think it’s a little ignorant not to learn about this and subsequently spread misinformation in the crypto space.

On the contrary to what these people believe, L2s will be the main focus for the Ethereum development team in the upcoming years as the merge happens and then dank sharding starts getting developed.

L2s won’t only be helping Ethereum scale its new beacon chain, they will literally become part of that chain down the line.

A lot of people are confusing merging with sharding and these two are not the same.The merge will not make gas on Ethereum cheaper, in fact, nothing will.

What the merge will do is significantly reduce power consumption (more than 99%) and pave the way for sharding which will in turn give a major boost of L2s and their throughput.Ethereum’s beacon chain will always be expensive to operate and will instead rely on L2s to handle the data.

In fact there are already scaling solutions being developed solely for that purpose most notable of which is Polygon Avail which will store data off chain and present only the data needed at the moment. This kind of scaling solution will drastically help with traffic and gas fees and will transform Ethereum into a much more efficient kind of blockchain.

Wrote a tool to generate historical PNL of any wallet on Ethereum,"I've been trading crypto long before Uniswap was a thing. But during all those years, nobody to this day created a simple script to generate a ROI/PNL report for your DeFi trades. Tired of waiting, I decided to build it myself.

As it stands, you can see a historical view of your trades / transactions and your monthly performance. So this tool aims to provide a historical overview of what actually happened. You can use it to:

\- Track your own performance

\- Analyze wallets/competitors for trading

"What happened with Ava Labs is a clear indication that any crypto with a company behind it, is not really crypto. It’s just a tool to help fund and further the main company’s agenda.","So apparently this is still “alleged” information and the Avax team has denied the claims (although they still haven’t published any explanation up until now)

But we’ve seen enough videos, recording and claims to sure that there is at least something very unethical practice happening with Ava Labs and Avalanche.

**TLDR;**

**Ava Labs (the company behind Avalanche) hires a legal team which then intentionally sues multiple big name networks in the market like Solana and Binance’s BSC chain in order get rid of competitors and get access to said competitors’ insider information through dirty legal tactics.**

Even some of the biggest and most respected names in the space like Foobar and Gainzy have already denounced Avalanche and their alleged practices.

I’m not here to antagonize any AVAX holders, on the contrary, I’m here to give my opinion/advice regarding these centralized companies and projects invading the crypto space.

Its very ironic of Avalanche to claim that they’re “completely decentralized” when everything happening behind the scenes (regardless of what happened yesterday) is fully controlled by a 100% centralized company with their own stocks, agendas, and profiteers.

Don’t get me wrong, we obviously need major companies to participate and get integrated into the crypto space if we ever dream of going mainstream.

I’ve always been vocal about this. I’ll use Polygon as an example here because they’re Avalanche’s main competitor and have always been attacked by Emin on Twitter (along with the many other projects he ironically slanders there as well)

Polygon has already helped introduce many companies into the crypto/Web3 space including social media conglomerates like Facebook and Disney, online payment giants like Stripe, and some of the most recognizable brands in the world like Coca Cola.

However, the main difference is that these companies have no control, influence, or any kind of say about what Polygon can or can’t do.

They don’t use Polygon as a way to manipulate the market to their own personal advantage.

Its so funny how Emin describes Avalanche as “decentralized” and accused not just Polygon but MANY other networks of being centralized and to some extent even evil, when the reality is that he was always doing the exact opposite of what he preached himself.

I won’t get into technical bullsh#t and all the “sell now” or “It’s going to see the same fait of LUNA” cringe you see everywhere.

I will however say advise anyone reading this to NOT invest any money into a coin that is backed by a company.

This literally goes against everything that crypto stands for in the first place.

I really hope this end well for Avalanche, its holders and its builders because non of them were involved in the dirty tricks that the higher ups were involved with.

I do hope however that these higher ups do receive the consequences they deserve.",319.0,2022-08-30 05:14:15,0.84

Mark Cuban counts himself among supporters of the upcoming Ethereum merge,"Billionaire Mark Cuban counts himself among supporters of the upcoming Ethereum “merge,” a highly anticipated upgrade for the blockchain that will dramatically reduce its ecological footprint.

“I’m a fan of the merge,” Cuban, a Shark Tank investor and owner of the Dallas Mavericks, tells Fortune. “I think the energy usage issue is important.”

Indeed, the merge—estimated to happen Sept. 15—will shift Ethereum from a proof-of-work consensus mechanism to proof of stake. Proof of work is an energy-intensive process that relies on miners to add new blocks and verify transactions, whereas proof of stake instead relies on a network of validators. In turn, once the merge happens, mining on Ethereum will be effectively eliminated, and its overall energy consumption is expected to decline by 99.9%.

That’s why Cuban said he sees the move to proof of stake as a positive.

“But it’s long term. I don’t \[know\] if and when it goes up,” he added.

Even still, “I think the applications to drive usage will be there,” Cuban said, adding that he remains super bullish on Ethereum.

When previously discussing his affinity for Ethereum, Cuban has repeatedly mentioned the network’s applications and use cases being a driver behind his support. Mainly, he’s talked about his interest in smart contracts—collections of code that execute a set of instructions on a blockchain. 

“What really changed everything was smart contracts,” he said in March 2021. “Smart contracts came along, and that created DeFi \[decentralized finance\] and NFTs \[or non-fungible tokens\]. That’s what changed the game. That’s what got me excited. That’s why it’s a lot like the internet.”

Cuban owns Ether, along with other cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and the meme-inspired Dogecoin. His portfolio also consists of a few NFTs and investments in blockchain companies, many related to bettering Ethereum.

Torando Cash’s ban wouldn’t have been as bad if we weren’t so dependent on centralized platforms. Here's what I mean,"A lot of people have become skeptical saying “if crypto was supposed to fight tyranny and centralized authority, then how did the US government cause such a ripple in the space?”

The main reason this happened is because of us, not crypto itself. We let centralized exchanges take over the entire crypto space. What do you expect to happen when an American centralized exchange like Coinbase or Binance US have everyone’s private information and facial ID?

What do you expect to happen when we rely on Tether or Circle for our stablecoins instead of something like MakerDAO’s DAI?

We are all a part of the problem. What we are in right now isn’t a crypto market because it’s centralized asf.

What we’re doing goes against everything that crypto stands for in the first place.

What happened to the days where DeFi was king?

Don’t get me wrong, DeFi TVL is still higher than that on CEX and we’re still seeing a lot of development in the DeFi world

AAVE will soon drop their own algo stablecoin similar to that of DAI.  
Bitdao already has $1.5 billion worth of assets in its treasury treasury and will soon launch its own L1  
Curve voted on adding even more liquidity to their pools (which is great because that would boost algo stablecoins even more).

But all of that alone still doesn’t matter when the other half of crypto is still run by centralized exchanges.   
Yes, DeFi TVL is higher but you can’t ignore how huge CeFi TVL is as well. People aren’t willing to lose this much money.

If we’d all use DEXs, DAOs and other DeFi tools, we wouldn’t care less about what the US government says because they can’t reach us. But when USDC, USDT, Coinbase, Binance US and many more crypto companies are US law abiding companies then it’s a big deal.

So bottom line, stop blaming crypto and DeFi. The fundamentals are still there. Start blaming the people that made the crypto space regulatory compliant. This is the reason why the US has such a huge effect on the crypto market that was supposed to be decentralized and only answers to the community in the first place.",128.0,2022-08-24 05:01:05,0.87

The Ethereum Merge and everything after," 

 *The Ethereum Merge is by no means the final stage of Ethereum's journey. It's a crucial step but still won't help Ethereum scale right away. In a recent talk, founder Vitalik Buterin sketched the milestones and end goal. In short: 100 thousand transactions per second, without sacrificing decentralization.*

Buterin unfolded the Ethereum roadmap at a conference in Paris in July 2022. He claims the long-anticipated Merge will make Ethereum about 55% finished after the Merge is complete. So then what's left to do? The end goal is to dramatically increase capacity without ultimately turning Ethereum into a massive centralized database. This requires all sorts of crafty ways to compress data and outsource data storage away from the Beacon chain.

The Ethereum Merge is arguably the major milestone as it replaces Ethereum's 'engine': its consensus mechanism. On the surface, users will not spot the differences between before and after. We can think of the Merge as keeping the exterior of a car intact while replacing the combustion engine with an electric engine. No small feat!

All the steps that come after the Merge are less fundamental but no less important: they have to do with scalability. They ensure that Ethereum can process orders of magnitude more transactions. Those improvements have to do with revving up the engine.

## Phase 1: The Merge 

The Ethereum Merge has been in the works for about seven years. The upgrade is all about the switch from proof-of-work to proof-of-stake. The Beacon chain, which has been tested for almost two years, will be merged with the old Ethereum blockchain. Mining will no longer be a business model in the Ethereum ecosystem and so Ethereum post-Merge will consume 99%+ less energy than before.

Also, from an investor’s perspective, Ethereum will change. Instead of miners securing the network, it will rely on ETH owners locking up some of their ETH as collateral to earn staking yields. Staking Ether becomes like an ""internet bond"" with the lowest risk of all Layer 1s. We’re dealing with a fundamentally different ‘economy’ here. After the Merge, Ethereum will no longer be a ‘mine-and-dump economy’ but a ‘stake-and-hold economy’. Whereas miners have to sell sooner or later to pay their bills, stakers benefit from staking as many ETH as possible: after all, compounded interest makes one wealthy.

The reason that Ethereum proponents are calling Ether ""ultra-sound money"" is that Ether will probably become deflationary after the Merge. Until the Merge, the block reward for miners is about 13,000 Ether per day. After the Merge, the new amount of ETH drops to just 1,500 per day. This 90% reduction corresponds to roughly three Bitcoin halvings. Hence, this deflationary move is also called the triple halving. Subtract from that the roughly 8,000 ETH burned per day, and your back-of-the-napkin calculus will tell you that the amount of existing ETH will decrease by roughly 1-2% per year. 

## Phase 2: The Surge

No, the Surge is not about the expected rise in the price of Ethereum... It’s all about scaling. As Vitalik Buterin said in a July 2022 interview:

*""You can lose a billion dollars from a hack but you can also lose a billion from everybody needing to pay way higher fees than they have to.""*

Scaling of many orders of magnitude is essential if Ethereum wants to support a decentralized ‘world computer’ that supports thousands of apps *and* that is affordable to use.

When Surge? After a hopefully successful Merge, work on the Surge will begin. Completion of the Surge is expected in 2023 but of course, there are no guarantees. 

The letter S in the wordplay on Merge refers to Sharding: the parallel existence of 64 blockchains or shards. This divides the huge data load that Ethereum will face (and already faces). All this data can of course not be crammed onto a single blockchain, because no one would be able to run an Ethereum node anymore. So to avoid throwing decentralization out of the window, Ethereum has to divide and conquer.

Of all 64 shards, the Beacon Chain - as the name suggests - will be the one that other shards rely on. The Beacon chain is often compared to the highway and the other shards to side roads. That’s one way to visualize it, as it conveys the image of spreading the traffic load. But this comparison misses the point that the shards will most likely not process transactions. Instead, they are used to store transaction data. So a more apt comparison would be that of the Beacon chain as the production line of the factory and the shards as data warehouses (even though it’s still a possibility that some shards will get execution rights).

Despite being (mostly) ‘just’ data warehouses, the shard chains will offer big improvements to transactions per second when combined with rollups. This is where so-called Danksharding comes in.

**Danksharding**

A few technical approaches have been suggested to take data load away from the Beacon chain. The details still have to be fleshed out. Danksharding is now the most likely candidate: it’s named after the developer who proposed it (Dankrad).

Danksharding works with ""data availability sampling,"" a technique that allows nodes on Ethereum to verify large amounts of data by sampling only a few pieces. It’s an efficiency measure and it is well-suited for the rollup era. Rollups, like sidechains, take the pressure off Ethereum by performing transactions on a separate, layer 2 chain.

## Phase 3: The Verge 

The Verge will introduce Verkle trees, yet another means to scale with greater efficiency. In Buterin's view, the Verge is ""great for decentralization.""

Verkle trees are of course a pun on Merkle trees, which are already used in Bitcoin and Ethereum. Merkle trees are a tool for ensuring reliable encryption by turning blocks of information into long strings of code. By adding all transactions in a block and creating a fingerprint of the entire set, it allows you to verify whether a transaction is included in the block. Verkle trees, in other words, make it possible to store a large amount of data by showing a short proof of any piece of that data. So they make the process of proof efficient. In this way, Verkle trees are a powerful upgrade to Merkle proofs. They will allow users to be network validators without having to store large amounts of data on their hard drives. Keep it decentralized!

## Phase 4: The Purge

The Purge is about removing (""purging"") old data from the Ethereum blockchain. Again, this will alleviate the data storage requirements for users who want to be validators but who do not have hundreds of Terabytes available.

After the Purge, Ethereum clients will discard data older than a year. This should minimize chain clogging and allow many more transactions to be processed. Buterin expects Ethereum to process 100,000 transactions per second after the implementation of The Purge.

Ethereum devs will still have to figure out where all those old blockchain data will go. Even though they are ‘old’, they are still vital to all kinds of applications. Where do all those hundreds of terabytes of essential transaction data go? One option is Arweave, the protocol created with the explicit goal of making centuries-long data storage possible. Arweave already stores the entire blockchains of Solana and Avalanche.

## Phase 5: The Splurge

According to Vitalik, the Splurge is all about the ""fun stuff"". Let’s see what techniques the dev team will come up with to further scale and speed up the Ethereum ecosystem, without sacrificing decentralization. ",43.0,2022-08-23 08:48:59,0.9

**INTRO**

**Transferring tokens between distributed ledgers**

>Tokens cannot simply be transferred from the distributed ledger for one cryptoasset to the distributed ledger for a different cryptoasset. For example, a bitcoin cannot exist on the Ethereum blockchain. An effect comparable to a ‘swap’ can be achieved using a smart contract and secure public address. The holder of the tokens uses a smart contract to transfer tokens to a public address that they don’t control. An equivalent amount of tokens of the second cryptoasset are transferred from a secure public address to a public address controlled by the person.

>The question that arises is whether this type of transactions results in a disposal for CGT purposes (for guidance on the general interpretation of disposal see CRYPTO22100. HMRC’s view is that the answer will depend on the facts.

**‘One-way’ transfers**

>Some transfers can only go in one direction, meaning that once the transfer has been made it cannot be undone or transferred back at a future date. **An example of this can be seen with the Ethereum blockchain. Currently ether are on the Ethereum ‘mainnet’ (short for main network, the main public Ethereum blockchain). Holders of ether can choose to transfer their tokens from the mainnet to a different blockchain called the ‘Beacon Chain’. The Beacon Chain blockchain is where Ethereum’s ‘Proof of Stake’ will be implemented (for more information on Proof of Stake see CRYPTO10300. It will be impossible to transfer ether from the Beacon Chain to the mainnet, making transfers a one-way process only.**

>HMRC’s view is that **TCGA92/S43** applies to this type of transaction. The allowable costs in respect of the first cryptoasset are attributed in full to the second cryptoasset. A gain or loss will accrue as normal on a subsequent disposal of the second cryptoasset.

Best way to stake 32 eth?,I’m feeling bullish and want to spend my money inherited on eth. If I bought 32 eth would it be easy to stake or complicated?,56.0,2022-08-22 00:08:44,0.73
Censorship and a potential fork (not powchain) after the Merge that may have serious consequences - summary,"There's a lot of confusion on this subject so I thought this would be worth posting.

After the merge, US based validators (PoS stakers) may be prevented from validating OFAC sanctioned transactions (e.g. tornadocash) if the US government decides so. Currently it is unclear whether this is the case. Anyone exposed to these sanctions will err on the side of caution to avoid jail time. Example - ethermine have been censoring TC sanctioned transactions for a week already (Bitfly who own ethermine will also be operating validators after the merge).

There is a very large portion of stake that would be exposed to these sanctions including some very large centralised actors such as Lido, Coinbase and Kraken. These 3 alone hold roughly 45% of all staked eth. There is not enough time for all of their stakes to exit the network due to the exit queue mechanism. If lido and coinbase both try to exit it would take about 2 months for all the validators to be removed from the list of validators. Until you're removed from the list you are expected to validate and are subject to penalties if you don't.

These validators will be forced to either 1. violate OFAC sanctions, 2. censor the transactions, or 3. abstain on blocks with sanctioned transactions. The board of Lido, Coinbase etc. are not going to prison for the good of Ethereum so we can safely rule out option 1 - despite what they may say on twitter.
If they take option 2 and censor, their stakes will get slashed (they lose 50% of their customer's funds) and their validators get kicked off the network.
If they take option 3 abstaining, they will also bleed out due to a penalty called inactivity leak, losing 50% of customer funds, and get kicked off. Inactivity leak is normally a very minor penalty, however if more than 33% of validators are inactive it gets much more severe (because this prevents block finality) and after 21 days, 50% of funds are lost and you are kicked off. Because so many validators will be exposed to the sanctions it is highly likely the severe leak penalty will be applied.

The 4th option is to fork into a censored ethereum chain. It is very likely that their customers will start screaming for this when they see their eth stakes melting due to penalties (slashing/leaking). Ok, so what you might ask, if they want to run off let them.

The problem is the stablecoins. If US validators fork off into censored-eth, the supply of USDC/USDT will have doubled, but Circle and Tether collateral has not. The stablecoin operators will have to choose a chain to support with their collateral. Unfortunately, it is again very likely that Circle, and probably Tether also, will opt to support the censored chain - this is because, as we all know, a lot of the money in the market comes from the USA. Stablecoin operators are already in the spotlight and they would likely see even more intense scrutiny if they were to instead support the uncensored chain. Both Circle and Tether are exposed to US law.

On whichever chain the stablecoin operators abandon, the entire defi system will immediately implode. Stables are used for collateral almost everywhere you look. They will become worthless on the chain they abandon.

Unfortunately the OFAC sanctions have come at the perfect time for this to be a problem It is too late to prevent this because of the exit queue system in place for validators, and the merge only being a month away. The only way to 100% guarantee this scenario does not play out is for the merge to be delayed again AND for Lido, coinbase and Kraken to voluntarily exit their stakes.
An issue with this is that their boards are legally obligated to act in the vests interests of their companies (and not their customers, or ethereum). Lido essentially shutting their business down flies directly in the face of this fiduciary obligation. It's hard to say how that will play out.

So we may be left with an uncensored eth that is in tatters because the stablecoins have abandoned that chain, and a censored chain that is essentially subject to the will of the US government - something Ethereum was specifically meant to avoid.

Right now the best thing we can do is look for ways to prevent this. I would start by campaigning for Lido etc to exit their stakes ASAP to prevent this situation. And unfortunately would ask the eth devs to push the merge back one last time for the greater good.",54.0,2022-08-21 02:39:39,0.74

I haven't been through this before.

In blockchain there's no such thing as ""build fast and break things"", it's more like ""build fast and make sure your code is perfect"" because once it's out there any small error could be fatal.

The IRS is going to have a field day if ETHPoW becomes a thing post Merge,"According to [current IRS guidance](https://www.irs.gov/individuals/international-taxpayers/frequently-asked-questions-on-virtual-currency-transactions), individuals that receive tokens post hard fork must count them as ordinary income equivalent to their “fair market value” upon receipt. This would be the moment a hard fork occurs for private wallet holders or when your CEX registers them in your account for those with funds in exchange.

What will be the next hyped market?," Over the years, we have seen various trends in fashion, food, and other areas, but Cryptocurrency has its own set of directions/hype. As Cryptocurrency is slowly being mass adopted, new markets emerge within the crypto industry. When this became a thing, it gained popularity in the mainstream media thanks to the bull market. If we had the current market back then, I doubt they would be known or will garner a massive amount of users. [Axie](https://axieinfinity.com/), [Pegaxy](https://pegaxy.io/), and [God's Unchained](https://godsunchained.com/) were some of the most popular games. Some people from third-world countries even used Axie as their sole source of income, leaving them in debt. 

Because they can be used in some P2E games, NFTs rode along with the P2E hype. Here are what are commonly referred to as ""jpegs."" They claimed that no two NFTs are alike, but many derivatives exist. There were even lawsuits/almost lawsuits, similar to [what happened with Bored Ape](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/vkoeli/yuga_labs_files_lawsuit_claiming_bored_ape_yacht/). To be honest, I was not a fan of NFT arts. But of course, NFTs are not just limited by jpegs and should not be only associated with it. NFTs can be lots of things like Music, Tickets, and In-game skins. Honestly, it can be anything. It just needs a little more time to be more polished.   


People have brought new markets such as virtual lands and more to the limelight. Some of them include Kirin's learn-to-earn project, in which you can answer quizzes and tests to earn crypto assets, [Aavegotchi](https://www.aavegotchi.com/) and [YOLOrekt's](https://www.yolorekt.finance/) bid to earn. They are distinct, but they both perform the same B2E function. In Aavegotchi, the Aavegotchi B2E auction modifies at least one of the four personality traits of an Aavegotchi: Energy, Aggression, Spookiness, and Brain Size, whereas YOLOrekt's B2E allows you to predict the price of the LP and bid on it. They are Dapps that you can use to make money quickly. I've tried them all, and based on my experience, so far, YOLOrekt's b2e is a much faster and more efficient way to earn, but of course, it's riskier and also, SocialFi is a key part of their concept. [Augur](https://augur.net/) is another example of a B2E, I heard it is much more difficult to use, but it has a much wider range of bets, which is fantastic. I would love to use it, but sadly, it's not available in my area. In comparison to other markets, Bid to Earn and Learn to Earn is still in their early stages.  
Also, stablecoins have grown in popularity as a means of securely storing value. For years, many individual traders have used [stablecoins](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/r04oye/i_think_im_missing_something_with_staking/) to ""park"" the value of their cryptocurrencies during non-trading hours and to transfer crypto between trading accounts. Stablecoins, on the other hand, gained popularity as a means of exchange for institutions for the first time in 2021, similar to other trends that existed for years but only recently gained popularity.

Crypto trends/hype can come in different forms. Anything is possible since we already had a Shitcoin era where there was a time when we had a constant flow of new useless coins called butt coin, porn coin, and a lot more. It's just a matter of time to know whether such projects will continue to be great or survive after the hype has gone down.",221.0,2022-08-17 05:55:51,0.91

I said it once and I’ll say it again. Gas fees on Ethereum will NEVER be cheap. Rollups are the ones that will have incredibly low gas fees. Let me explain:,"# EDIT: would love to answer any questions regarding sharding in the comments. I actually made a post 2 days ago that is entirely dedicated to sharding with a lot of details that can help.

&#x200B;

Sharding (which will eventually be introduced by mid-2023) will not change throughput for Layer 1. It will however dramatically pump throughput for Layer 2 and beyond. This throughput will increase anywhere from 10k to 100k depending on the type of Layer 2 and the technological advancement of said Layer 2.

Initially, Vitalik and the rest of Ethereum’s development team did indeed plan on lowering gas fees on the Ethereum blockchain itself. They planned on implementing sharding all over the blockchain including EVM, data, smart contracts, accounts, and everything else on the chain.

However, it dawned upon them later on that it would be much easier and less complicated to implement sharding just for data, and thus the responsibility of scalability suddenly didn’t lie on the Ethereum blockchain but on rollups.

You could argue against it but I personally think it was a good idea. L2s have one job and that is to scale Ethereum. So they already have the tech development ready to be implemented and upgraded as opposed to Ethereum developing their own built-in scalability which might take years.

Then there’s the fact that these L2 have already been tried and tested multiple times. They know exactly what could go wrong and how to avoid it.

Ethereum on the other hand never had a built-in scalability system and thus if anything goes wrong it would be a nightmare.

L2s are incredibly safe because they derive their safety from Ethereum itself so you’re basically using Ethereum but in a much more efficient manner.

This is only gonna get better and better as new zkEVM tech starts rolling out.

Right now there are only a couple proper zkEVMs that are in development most prominent of which are Polygon’s Hermez and Zksync’s zkEVM

The main difference between these two is that currently Zksync’s is still closed source which I personally think makes it much harder for developers to use and to some extent defeats the purpose of a zkEVM

Hemrez on the other hand will be fully open source and accessible for any developer to build dApps with which is great news for the Ethereum ecosystem overall

But other than that, I have no criticism. I think what scaling solutions are doing right now is already amazing. Coupled with sharding later on in 2023 (hopefully lol) and they will make Ethereum unstoppable.

Any criticism about Ethereum being inefficient will be put down instantly.

To some extent, scaling solutions won’t be thought of as a separate part of Ethereum that helps it scale. They will literally become an inseparable part of Ethereum itself and will become taken for granted even as part of the Ethereum experience.",406.0,2022-08-16 04:13:14,0.85
What’s the implication for current ETH holders after the merge?,"The merge is happening to switch Ethereum from a PoW to a PoS chain. Take an example of a 100 ETH holder, what will happen to the 100 ETH in the holder’s wallet after the merge?

What would happen if the US Treasury puts the USDC/WETH and/or USDT/WETH LP CA's of Uniswap/Sushiswap and the other dexes on the blacklist?,"Would Circle and iFinex/Tether blindly update their contracts within 24 hours? I mean, it basically means the state demands them to burn some IOU's that can then not be exchanged for backing meaning these companies now get to keep that backing.

To those who are asking why the US Treasury would put these CA""s on their blacklist .... what if a politician with enough power to put pressure on the US Treasury decide to put these on there with the intent to crash the price of Ethereum because he shorted it first.

Some other unknowns.

all the USDC inside USDC/WETH is suddenly frozen on the top 10 dexes, what happens to oracles like chainlink what price for USDC/ETH do they report if something like this would happen?

Standardizing trustless DApp frontends,"This is something I've been mulling over a long time and it seems timely to have a discussion about it. 

**Why are smart contract frontends still websites? Why haven't we moved past this?**

There are multiple pressing reasons for moving towards trustless frontends:

 * Developers may be compelled to limit access to their own DApps, pushing users to questionably safe alternative frontend implementations. We see this now in the scramble to comply with sanctions.

 * Hackers or malicious devs change the website code to steal funds. Recently seen in the DNS attack on Curve, this has happened often since the beginning, keeps happening, and will continue to happen as long as smart contracts are being accessed through websites. It is inherently insecure.

 * Web code is nigh-unauditable. Even if it wasn't subject to arbitrary updates at any moment (such as hosted on IPFS), it's still very difficult to determine the code does nothing malicious, because a modern website is a bloated mass of compiled javascript.

What would an alternative look like?

I envisage a client application that takes a smart contract address and a maximally barebones UI specification (more of a config file than a website), and renders a working interface for the user. These specifications would be simple for someone familiar with the intended use of the functions in the target smart contract to tell from a brief reading whether they are malicious. There could be some mechanisms for confirming legitimacy for regular users, like the UI specs being included as annotations in the comments of the smart contract, or message signing from the official devs or trusted figures attesting they've looked it over and it seems fine.

Any thoughts or ideas? Are there other considerations such a standard would need to address? Have things like this already been attempted? Are there reasons it hasn't or wouldn't work or be adopted?",23.0,2022-08-13 20:23:23,0.97

**Update 1**
 
A quick update since I posted this - there is quite a bit of activity on TC as of 08/12 (not taking credit for all of it of course, but nice to see anyway).
See [https://etherscan.io/address/0xd90e2f925da726b50c4ed8d0fb90ad053324f31b](https://etherscan.io/address/0xd90e2f925da726b50c4ed8d0fb90ad053324f31b). **Over 100 deposits in the last two days totaling  2799.8 ETH!**

If you participated - thank you for doing so. I think you will be glad that you did not just sit back and observe.



**Update 2**

It seems [someone](https://twitter.com/jeetsidhu_/status/1558416493494386688) is making a bunch of withdrawals from TC and is sending it to prominent folks using the ENS registry. I know this is probably controversial, but I think it's good. This affects everyone of us and no one - particularly people that made a shit ton of money off of Ethereum should be allowed to feel like it does not concern them.


**********************************************************************************

If you are still wondering if this is important or not - let me add a few additional thoughts:


The only thing that is pretty decentralized in Ethereum right now are the nodes (the miners). Come THE MERGE this will no longer be the case - Lido will be an enormous centralizing influence and it will be the point of gov't attacks and pressure to drop certain transactions. 

This is not a question of ""IF"" but of ""WHEN"". This needs to be planned for ahead of time. I hope everyone understands that if validation can be captured it's game over for Eth.

What will we do when the gov't knocks on Lido's door and tells them to drop certain transactions from black-listed dApps? In many ways what is (or is not) happening now is a rehearsal for what will happen then.

"A follow-up to my “what is the merge” post. This time let’s discuss the next upgrade after merging, “The Surge”.","As with the merge, the surge has more than one step to it but we’re only really interested in one important thing which is Sharding

Now before we understand what Sharding is we have to understand why Ethereum is so expensive and slow to use in the first place.

I expect that a lot of users here already know how the Ethereum bidding system works so you can skip this one right away if you want to

&#x200B;

# - Why is Ethereum so inefficient?

Ethereum currently runs on PoW (proof of work) meaning that all transactions are proven to be real by miners that solve very complicated computational problems for a small fee of course.

You as a user would obviously want your transaction to go through fast but Ethereum is a very popular chain and there are a lot of people ahead of you. For you to try and “skip ahead” of them, you’ll basically “tip” the validators a little bit more than others, and boom! You become their priority. So basically its a bidding game. Whoever is willing to “tip” more gets their transaction validated faster.

&#x200B;

# - Why does the merge come before the surge?

Think of Ethereum as a long stretch of road that has one single lane. It works well sometimes but when it gets congested, IT GETS CONGESTED…

This is exactly why the merge comes before all other upgrades.

Developers realized that Ethereum has great demand and the “road”  they created(which represents the blockchain)  needs a ton of new fixes. But fixing this “road” means that traffic will come to a complete halt and so will hundreds of billions of dollars in assets.

Therefore they created a completely different “road” which is the beacon chain and that chain has the capacity to undergo upgrades and development without having to stop traffic.

&#x200B;

# - What is Sharding and how does it work?

What Sharding will do is the equivalent of creating many more lanes (64 to be exact) on a brand new created road (the Beacon chain).

Ethereum can only process around 15 transactions per second and has maxed out once at only around 16 TPS. So it’s safe to say that Ethereum isn’t the fastest of blockchains. So developers came up with Sharding as a solution.

Sharding is an algorithmic process of splitting a blockchain up into many smaller pieces and, well, shards with many of these pieces overlapping and working in parallel. It is executed in a way that will allow anyone to verify their shard and still 100% trust the rest of the blockchain.

&#x200B;

# - Initial plans for Sharding and how they changed

The plan initially was the implement Sharding on the entire Ethereum blockchain (this includes the EVM, data, smart contracts, account, and everything else on the chain). However, Vitalik and the rest of the developers decided that it would be a better idea to implement Sharding on the data alone. This is why ***rollups will take over scaling and not the blockchain itself***

&#x200B;

# - The importance of L2s for the future of Ethereum

As I mentioned in the previous section, plans for Sharding changed and the responsibilities of scalability now fall on L2s (rollups basically).

Scaling solutions like Optimism, Immutable X, Arbitrum, Loopring and many more do all of their computations and storage offchain and end up posting data back to Ethereum

Without getting into a lot of technical details, Sharding will basically put these scaling solutions on Steriods

I mentioned in my previous post that I am in fact biased towards Polygon and some people in the comments genuinely asked as to why. Here is exactly why I’m biased towards them (by the way this does not mean that I think other scaling solutions are bad. I’m fond of many other scaling solutions and I always invite competition)

The most important feature of Sharding is data availability.

Right now there are Ethereum nodes. They’re essentially a bunch of computers that keep a fully comprehensive record of the entire blockchain. As you can imagine, this takes up A TON of precious and expensive space for data.

Well, it just so happens that Polygon already has a solution for that in the form of Polygon Avail. No other scaling solution has their current technology in that sector.

What Polygon Avail essentially does is solve the problem of data availability by storing data offchain and presenting only the needed data when actually needed

It basically shows Ethereum proof that “yes, the entire data is safe and sound. Here is the small amount of data you need right now” without having to burden Ethereum with the massive amounts of data that most of it won’t be used and will slow down the Ethereum network.

Again, I think competition is an amazing thing to have especially in a tech market like this one so I support all scaling solutions but as I said, I personally think Polygon has an edge over others.

&#x200B;

# - Some cool features that come with Sharding

This post is starting to get long so I’ll talk about one feature actually that I think is very cool but is also extremely important

Sharding will actually change the way that nodes are selected to validate each shard

I’ll throw in an example given by Vitalik.

Imagine there are 6,400 nodes and 64 Shards (the standard). Every time that a shard and a block need verification, the Beacon chain (new PoS chain) will select at random 100 nodes to validate a block and the same will happen for the next block and the one after that, and so on (all at random).

The cool and important thing about this all lies in security. An attacker will now find it much harder to attack the network because he will require a large portion of the network to do so and would need that for a much longer time now.

I hope this post was helpful and I’d love to answer any questions in the comments!

I enjoyed answering questions in the previous post and would love to make another post about the upgrade after the surge (the verge, or Merkle trees update) if it wins popular demand!",102.0,2022-08-12 16:18:43,0.9
"This is Going to Be Unpopular, but Ethereans Need to Hear It","I deeply disagree with the actions taken by OFAC. Nonetheless, I want to understand why the govt attacked Tornado *specifically*, while leaving other privacy protocols untouched. The statements and actions by the US govt actually make it quite clear why these Eth addresses were sanctioned and placed on the OFAC list ...

Tornado Cash is an Eth address where people input personal funds to a shared common pool. Ultimately, they will end up in possession of units of Eth which came from other people. This is a cooperative process. A large amount of funds from hacks/crimes are transparently being sent to that common mixing pool.

***From the govts perspective*** (not my own), this is no different than swapping marked $100 bills with gangsters. Users are choosing to swap their units of Eth, with Eth that came from criminals. ***This*** is the primary/critical reasoning by which OFAC sanctioned those Eth addresses.

Critically, this is not a broad generic attack against privacy and anonymity. For example, the govt left Monero untouched, despite the fact that it's larger, offers better privacy/anonymity, and has existed for longer.

Because ***from the govts perspective***, there is a big difference, since Monero is an encryption protocol where your funds are *NEVER* sent to a common pool, and you can prove that you *NEVER* end up with anyone else's units of XMR. Monero is functionally very different than a mixer.

For bureaucrats and lawyers, that is a huge distinction. If you think about it ... encryption is still legal. VPNs, Tor, and Monero are still legal. The ***only*** thing that OFAC sanctioned, were the addresses being used to ***mix*** funds together.

I understand why the ETH bros want to portray this as a broad attack against all privacy protocols. But that simply isn't the case. It's ***only*** an attack against protocols which require the active mixing of your funds together to a common pool.

"What is the Ethereum merge, what are its economic implications and what are its main risks and misconceptions?","Before we understand what the merge really is we first have to understand the difference between PoW and PoS and how Ethereum will transfer from the former to the latter.  
I’m assuming that the vast majority of users here understand this so you can skip this part if you want.

# - PoW and PoS

As of the writing of this post, Ethereum currently runs on PoW (proof of work). The main goal of the merge is for Ethereum to move over to PoS (proof of stake).

The main difference between these two is that with PoW the network is secured by miners that have to purchase and run Ethereum mining hardware. This model has proven to be extremely inefficient since miners have to consume electricity in order to issue new blocks. This is exactly why Ethereum is notorious for being slow and expensive.

With the PoS model, on the other hand, the network is secured by validators who instead stake ETH in order to validate network activity. With this model, power consumption decreases dramatically.

With PoS, the network becomes more efficient, more secure, and can start benefiting from further upgrades most prominent of which is Sharding (which will be mentioned later on)  


# - What is the “merge”?

When people talk about “the merge” they’re actually talking about two-step of which the actual merge is one of them.

The first step is launching the Beacon Chain which was already done successfully in December of 2020.

The main goal behind this was to be able to test a chain running in parallel with the already existing PoW network without causing any disruption.

Another reason for this was to give time for stakers to stake enough ETH to secure the new network when implementing the actual merge

The second step is what we call the marge and it's what everyone is talking about right now.

The merge is simply the act of merging the consensus layer of the Beacon chain with the EVM state of the Ethereum PoW chain.  


# - What happens when the merge is fully implemented?

For starters, the power consumption needed to execute transactions and everything else on Ethereum dramatically decreases from what it was with PoW.  
In fact, it will decrease by almost 99.95%.

This is great for multiple reasons:

Firstly this makes Ethereum ESG compliant which is great for institutions overall especially ones that are regulatory driven. This will most definitely help boost mainstream adoption since many more global institutions will start exploring the Web3 space.

Second of all, a lot of the environmentally driven critics will finally shut down their arguments about NFTs, DeFi, and all Ethereum activity overall ruining the planet.

Third and finally, the merge will open up the groundwork for new updates included in the Ethereum roadmap that all of which combined will improve Ethereum overall, most important of which is Sharding.  


# - Misconceptions about the merge and how Sharding is related to that

The merge on its own will not make Ethereum gas fees lower. In fact, NOTHING will make gas on the Ethereum chain itself lower.

The Ethereum roadmap is not working on lowering gas fees on the chain, but instead is working on improving and integrating rollups and L2s in order for THEM to help with gas fees and traffic overall.

The L2 wars are more competitive than ever before but I think this is good news for Ethereum overall because it rewards innovation and new tech. But I’m personally biased towards Polygon as of now.

Speaking of which, I still have no idea how people still fall for this misconception that L2s and scaling solutions will be irrelevant with “ETH 2.0” (which isn’t even a thing anymore) even though Vitalik himself talked about it at the Polygon ZK summit back in 2021 where he discussed the importance of rollups on Ethereum

Ever since then, we’ve seen a flurry of development in the rollup scene and most notably the ZK-rollup with the recently mentioned Polygon leading the way with their open source zkEVM.

They already have 8 multipurpose Ethereum scaling solutions all of which will become even more efficient with Sharding introduced.  


# - What is the main risk behind the merge?

Any upgrade to any new technology comes with risks. This isn’t “FUD”. These are simply very improbable yet still realistic scenarios that may compromise the security of the PoS network.

Right now the biggest concern is a DOS scenario.

Since validators are the ones that are securing the chain, the network can technically be in danger of something called Network In Denial of Service (DOS) where if the attacker can know exactly which proposer is next in line they can try to DOS said proposer and strip them of their slot. The transactions that come with this slot can now be picked up by the attacker.

This is a very improbable scenario and already has solutions most popular of which is SSLE. Its basically complicated cryptography that prevents the attacker from knowing which proposer is next in line

I hope this post clears up some misconceptions, questions, and concerns overall. I’d be happy to answer any questions in the comments.",334.0,2022-08-11 13:57:27,0.94

"Ofac Sanctions are the US's nuclear option, and the US has shown it intends to use Terror to get it's way via executive action.","No protocol is safe now, anything that can be alleged to have provided an opportunity for foreign state actors to money launder, is now a national security interest to the united states. The Ofac has decided to sanction code and speech and knows it will take years to play out in court. Now every dev team in the world has to live in fear if it does not institute on chain full KYC aml for all defi protocols.

I tried to tell people for the last two years that the end game of the government was to force narcware at the software level, I begged people on reddit to take the Fatf revision drafts in 2019 and 2020 serious, that the drafts were openly stating that they want narcware on wallets and they want all wallets fully doxxed and declared, they want an gap in chain history to be criminal. 

I am not paranoid. I understand the law. The lawyers to Ledger and Trezor understand the law. Coincenter understands the law. **Reddit does not understand the law.**

The point of shutting down Bitmex to US customers was to create precedent for the Banking secrecy act applied to US citizens involved in crypto and precedent for extraditing foreigner non US citizens. This shows deliberate premeditation by the Department of Justice, State Department, and Treasury to force US aml/kyc laws and SEC/CFTC licensing regimes through violence against non US citizens. Their long goal was to violently intimidate other countries into complying with our laws. 

We are already looking at every american being a felon because 6050i revision was passed in September 2021 and will come to term in January 2024, where it will go into effect as enforceable. The government is openly long conning us to enforce global KYC on Defi, and software wallets, and eventually hardware wallets. They know they're violating the 4th and 1st amendment and they intend to get away with it through terrorism using Ofac.

They have long had a desire to destroy end to end encryption, this is an open plan Bill Barr had, they want golden keys to all encryption, they do not want permissionless systems to exist, and yes they can sanction the repository of monero code, and begin enforcing these strict liability 30 year prison sentences onto anyone who uses monero and gets caught. 

You people are not using your brains. The only way to convince Federal prosecutors that a protocol can comply with US sanction and aml laws is to enforce KYC and licensing systems, this is crony gangster capitalism to benefit Terrence Duffy, SBF, and the Chicago Mercantile Exchange and american Web 2 Tech companies, and US private equity by using \*Terrorism\* to put their permissionless competitors out of business, and enforcing the KYC necessary to enforce the licensing system! and they're taking your privacy!

The tornado cash opportunity. How we can learn from this attack to prevent it from happening again,"The recent sanctions of the US government marks a **new chapter** in the history of Ethereum. It’s the first time that the US directly attacks a smart contract.

With their actions they have demonstrated that they know better our vulnerabilities than what we thought. But this demonstration of power can teach us how they are going to proceed in future attacks, which for sure are going to come as the Ethereum network starts taking away a big share of the financial system.

From the experience of this attack we can see that the principal point of failure in the current system is all of the non-decentralized platforms and protocols that are not required but essential to make the network work. I’m going to enumerate them and some possible solutions to the problems:

* **RPC’s**: it doesn’t make sense to have a 100% decentralized system if the channel that you use to connect to it is 100% centralized. We need to start using by default in our wallets decentralized RPC’s. Unfortunately this is not easy, as running a full node requires a lot of hardware requirements. Fortunately we’ll soon have light clients which will enable us to query and validate the network with little resources.
* **DNS**: dapp’s must have a frontend deployed on IPFS (with a decentralized pinning service like Filecoin) accessible with a .eth domain. But this is not enough! as currently the DNS translation is done using centralized RPC’s. When light clients are available, browsers will need to use them as the default DNS resolver.
* **GitHub:** I wouldn’t have ever imagined that this could pose a threat to Ethereum security but as we saw it’s a significant point of failure. **All the DAPP’s code must be always accessible** in a decentralized, global, searchable place, with a nice UI to interact with it. Currently there are two projects aiming at solving this problem: [radicle](https://radicle.xyz/) and gitopia.
* **USDC/TETHER:** we already knew this but it is good to remember the risk that this kind of stablecoins generate. Fully decentralized stablecoins don’t exist, but DAI and FRAX are a significantly better option as not 100% of its collateral comes from assets outside of the chain.
* **Metamask:** there has not been any problem with it, but as a closed source software and critical part of most of the Ethereum transaction we should take it into consideration. A project aiming to solve this problem is [tally](https://tally.cash/), they are fully open source and they have a DAO, although their product doesn’t have as many features as Metamask yet.
* [**localcryptos**](https://localcryptos.com/) **> Coinbase:** last but not least. Even if all the previous measures are implemented correctly it is going to be of no use if the government prohibits citizens from using a dapp. Wallets should be anonymous from the first time that users get into crypto so the government can’t impose their regulations on the users, so stay anonymous and evade KYC.

And that’s all, hopefully with measures like this and more that will come we’ll be able to build a better future.

A developer.

**Frequently Asked Questions**

**Where's the best place to buy ETH?**

There are many centralized exchanges that support Ethereum. If you live in the US, the most popular exchanges are Coinbase, Gemeni and Kraken. Coinbase users can use Coinbase Pro for lower fees.

**When is Eth2 launching?**

Eth2 is a marketing term used to represent a number of updates to Ethereum. The Eth2 proof-of-stake chain first launched in December 2020. ""The Merge"", which is the event that will fully switch Ethereum's consensus to proof-of-stake, is estimated to be ready in early 2022, although there is no exact timeline. Other updates, such as data shards, will follow that update.

Visit [ethmerge.com](https://ethmerge.com/) to learn more about ""The Merge"".

**Do I need to do anything to update to Eth2? Will Eth2 create a new token?**

No, ETH holders *never* need to take any action to keep holding ETH. Ethereum users will be unaffected by the Eth2 upgrade. And the Eth2 updates will not create any new tokens.

**How can I stake my ETH?**

The best way to stake your ETH: by running your own validator.

* Running your own validator requires a modern computer and 32 ETH. Visit /r/ethstaker for more details

**Why are Ethereum transaction fees so high?**

Like most blockchains, Ethereum fees are determined by supply-and-demand. The large demand to use Ethereum has pushed transaction fees quite high (however, fees were just a few cents only 2 years ago). Fees are especially high during market volatility, and during NFT drops.

**What is being done to lower Ethereum transaction fees?**

Ethereum fees are reduced by using layer-2 rollups. Rollups are scaling solutions that allow for significantly cheaper transactions, while still maintaining Ethereum's security.

Additionally, Eth2's data shards will make rollups even cheaper.

While rollups are cutting-edge technology being actively developed, a number are already live on Ethereum mainnet. Visit [l2beat.com](https://l2beat.com/) to learn more about rollups.

**What's the best wallet for Ethereum?**

The most popular tool for using decentralized applications is Metamask. However, for security reasons, we recommend using a hardware wallet such as a Trezor or Ledger.

"Merging and Sharding won’t make scaling solutions obsolete. On the contrary, they’ll give scaling solutions more value.","This is a very common misconception in the Ethereum space and it’s actually been addressed on multiple occasions for a while not. Yet, the nearer the merge will be happening the more I’m starting to see people comment about “scaling solutions being obsolete when ETH2.0 rolls out”.

First of all, ETH2.0 is not a thing anymore. Ethereum on its own will not scale. ETH gas fees will always be high and we should swallow that pill already.

Ethereum is following a rollup-centric roadmap that will give more advantages and leverage to L2s and NOT the Ethereum blockchain itself.

This is exactly why we’ve been seeing so much development recently in the L2 space especially with zero-knowledge.

ZkSync has had their zkEVM testnet out for months now. Although I think its very frustrating that its closed source. It literally defeats the whole purpose of a zkEVM.

Polygon has their zkEVM in development still right now but its the only open source zkEVM that I know of so far.

And we’re only getting started. The growth in the L2 and scalability game is growing exponentially each passing day.

If we keep up this pace, Ethereum will become unrecognizable. The gas fee issues will become entirely irrelevant and Ethereum critics will shut up.

This will all happen thanks to scaling solutions, not Ethereum itself.

Vitalik himself even expressed his support for L2s and said something along the lines of that Ethereum’s future relies entirely on scaling solutions and more specifically rollups.",64.0,2022-08-06 21:33:42,0.85

Technical questions around how validation will work under Danksharding," Hi all,  


I have some technical questions about danksharding and validation committees.

From this post on two-slot proposer-builder separation: [https://ethresear.ch/t/two-slot-proposer-builder-separation/10980](https://ethresear.ch/t/two-slot-proposer-builder-separation/10980), danksharding is meant to be a two-slot process, meaning (if I've understood it correctly) it will take two 8-second slots for the whole build-propose-verify-append process to be completed.

https://preview.redd.it/ilra7u7ajpf91.png?width=1162&format=png&auto=webp&s=58908e091f7da720e50bea2363c220e50feac1a4

With PBS, after the intermediate block deadline, we see the remaining 'N-1 committees' attest to the block body. My first questions:  
1. Is the committee size here still the same as that intended immediately post-Merge, i.e. 128 validators, or something else?  
2. What is N here? The whole validator set available divided by 128?  
3. These N-1 committees attest to the block body tying up to the block header. But do they also verify for data availability and transaction validity (i.e. check for validity proofs in the case of ZKRs, or raise fraud proofs in the case of ORs)?  


My next questions relate to this report: [https://members.delphidigital.io/reports/the-hitchhikers-guide-to-ethereum](https://members.delphidigital.io/reports/the-hitchhikers-guide-to-ethereum), and specifically, this image from it:  


https://preview.redd.it/jf4k0qucjpf91.png?width=3600&format=png&auto=webp&s=aa1842526b6b9dd1369c895b8a7ff623325028c9

(Image taken from section titled 'Danksharding – Honest Majority Validation'.)

My additional questions from the image:  
4. 1/32 of the whole validator set is assigned to attest to the data availability of the block in each slot, as there are 32 slots in an epoch. But with PBS, the block cycle now should take two slots! So is this incorrect? Or should it be something like 1/16 attesting every two slots?  
5. Is '1/32 of the validator set' meant to be the same as the 'N-1 committees', and these data availability checks happens at the same time as that process? Or is this data availability verification a separate process with different groups of validators that happens after the 'N-1 committee' attestation?  
6. Does the '1/32 of the validator set' also attest to the transaction validity of each block?   
7. Later in the same report it's stated that it's intended for the other full nodes (i.e. those not in the validation set) to do their own private data availability sampling. If so, will they \*\*also\*\* be doing their own transaction validity verifications? This may be trivial for validity proofs, but I expect it may be quite onerous for fraud proofs. How would this work in practice?",23.0,2022-08-04 14:34:18,0.93
Will generating ZK proof on L2 be decentralised? Which hardware will be used?,"I’m not sure if this should be submitted here or on r/Ethermining. But the main thing is ZKP so this should be here? Anyway,

I have some gpu cards which I’ve been using for mining eth and bitcoin in the last 2 years. Since Ethereum is transitioning from PoW to PoS while Bitcoin mining with GPU isn’t that profitable, I’ve been considering to sell those cards

However, yesterday I found this [article from Scroll](https://scroll.mirror.xyz/nDAbJbSIJdQIWqp9kn8J0MVS4s6pYBwHmK7keidQs-k) where it says they will generate ZKP in parallel. I guess it means ZK proofing will be the next (somekind of) mining

Then I found this [post from Paradigm](https://www.paradigm.xyz/2022/04/zk-hardware), according to the article, FPGAs will be used due to its flexibility, ASICs maybe used if a ZKR dominating the L2, while GPUs are the most less likely to be used for generating ZKP

I was disappointed for a min, yet I found this [article from Polygon](https://blog.polygon.technology/introducing-plonky2/). They invent Plonky2 where it can generates ZKP using M1 Pro GPU on a Macbook in less than a sec

So, should I swap my GPU for ETH LSDs or should I wait for parallel ZK proofing as a substitute for mining?

Did you know that NFT tickets are planned for the 2023 Rugby World Cup and the Olympics and Paralympics 2024?,"I've always been a supporter of blockchain tickets since it's been shown that they eliminate all scams, frauds, and black marketing. They are the safest option for purchasers and quite valuable for event organizers, also, buyers may gain much from these NFT tickets.   
 

As a result, I was both astonished and delighted to learn that the 2024 Olympics in France will sell this sort of ticket. As I read, they said that these tickets will provide spectators with increased protection.   
 

Think about the recent ticketing scandal in France during the Champions League final. Following this shambles, I wouldn't be surprised if UEFA starts selling NFT tickets as well.   
 

I believe it is prudent to keep a look out for NFT ticketing systems in general, since more and more events will begin to offer these tickets. Whether it's NFT TiX or another platform, these platforms are unquestionably the future of the ticketing system.   
 

Researchers even describe how all of this will operate during the Olympics, stating that fans would be able to access them by scanning a QR code produced using blockchain technology. Everyone will check in, and once inside the arena, their tickets will be deactivated.   
 

Did you know that NFT tickets are already planned for the 2023 Rugby World Cup and the Olympics and Paralympics 2024 and practiced by major events such as the French International Tennis?

"Vitalik once said “I don't hate apes, I just want them to fund public goods!”. Just cause we CAN build anything on Ethereum doesn’t mean we SHOULD","Yes, Vitalik created Ethereum for people to build anything on it. Ethereum is completely decentralized so no one can tell you what to build, what to invest in and what to support over all. Decentralization means you can literally do anything you want as long as it’s within the blockchain’s reach.

But that doesn’t automatically mean that we should be dumping billions of dollars combined into projects that have no real utility or purpose to the community.

The entire reason Ethereum (and decentralization) was created was to give power to the populous.

Its a still very early conversation, but if DeFi and DAOs go mainstream we become a self governing society. This is what the vision of Vitalik was when he created Ethereum.

Again, you could technically use Ethereum solely for creating dog coins and no one can stop you. But why do that? It has no real utility of value.

DeFi and DAOs on the other hand provide value and services for the populous.

You can use something like AAVE to take out a loan any time of the year regardless of you background. This was what real value is. You can use something like Bitdao to govern the ecosystem by your own. They’re literally going to be governing a new L1 on their own. This is what real decentralization is all about. Not dog coins and monkey pictures.

Dr. Ian Malcolm once said, “your scientists were so preoccupied with whether or not they could, they didn't stop to think if they should.” This also applies to Ethereum. A lot of people look at decentralization as “i can do whatever i want” which is technically true. But you’re also misusing the blockchain for its unintended purpose.",169.0,2022-08-02 15:33:01,0.86

NFT tickets significantly increase the client's trust,"I believe it will undoubtedly improve market circumstances, therefore increasing sales. The following are some of the key benefits of employing NFT in the ticketing sector.  


There are several significant advantages, including:  


\- Elimination of fraud/fake tickets,  
\- Programmable NFT tickets - In practice, event organizers may earn while selling NFT tickets on the secondary market by writing the profit allocation criteria for future resales into them (or their smart connections).  
\- NFTs can convert the tickets into a payment mechanism, creating a massive possibility for income (for example, NFT tickets can be used as collecting goods or as bonuses to entice people to purchase a particular number of tickets to events).  


In reality, you can figure it all out a lot more easily, I've learned so much about NFT TiX and its perks.  


Of course, there are some additional advantages, such as the possibility to reduce ticket costs and the speed with which NFT tickets may be generated.  


Each of the advantages of NFTs mentioned above may significantly increase the client's trust. This will have an immediate impact on event attendance and, consequently, ticket sales. As a result, this is a win-win situation for all of us!",73.0,2022-07-30 21:05:45,0.76

"Happy Birthday, Ethereum!","Today the second biggest cryptocurrency - Ethereum - celebrates its 7th birthday. What did those years look like?

Price-wise, Ethereum grew A LOT. From its all-time-low in 2015 of $0.432979 to its all-time-high of $4878 in 2021.

Technology-wise, Ethereum has pioneered the concept of a blockchain smart contract platform and built a strong foundation for many new projects.

Ethereum’s DeFi scene is the biggest one out there, with successful DApps bringing more awareness to the platform over the years. And let’s not forget artists that make millions of dollars by bringing their work to the blockchain via NFTs.

Fun fact, the co-founder of Ethereum, Vitalik Buterin, says that the project is now only 40% complete.

At the Ethereum Community Conference in Paris, he compared the network to its longtime rival, stating that “the difference between Bitcoin and Ethereum is that Bitcoiners consider Bitcoin to be 80% complete, but Ethereans consider Ethereum to be 40% complete.” And that Ethereum will reach 55% after a long-awaited merge, where it will shift from proof of work to proof of stake.

We wish them a successful merge and can’t wait to see the full potential of ETH!

Why doesn't Ethereum core developers work on zk proofs?,"Sorry if this question may sound stupid.

Vitalik Butterin said that ""in the medium to long term ZK rollups will win out in all use cases as ZK-SNARK technology improves."" (https://vitalik.ca/general/2021/01/05/rollup.html#conclusion). It means that he truly believes in the power of zk proofs technology. He thinks that they may be the best answer to scale Ethereum.
So, instead of just ""watching"" other teams working on it, why don't Ethereum core developers work on a such implementation?

- Is it because they need to focus on the move to Ethereum 2.0 ?
- Is it because the true nature of L1 is different from the nature of L2, in terms of ethos, principles, vision, etc. ?  And so they would just prefer to focus on other things?

Thanks!",25.0,2022-07-30 03:44:27,0.8
I still see “ETH 2.0” being thrown around. It is just not a thing anymore. The Foundation has changed up the nomenclature and marketing surrounding the Ethereum roadmap.,"I’m surprised as to how many people are still confused about this. So here are some footnotes.Ethereum’s roadmap has a lot of upgrades but the most significant two will be merging and Sharding.

# 

# - Oh no! What will happen to my staked ETH?

Don’t worry about that. When the merge with beacon chain happens (Ethereum going from PoW to PoS which was originally marketed as ETH2.0) the number one priority will be enabling withdrawals. The merge happen anytime soon now, with withdrawals scheduled for \~6 months after the merge is fully complete

# 

# - Gas Concerns

Gas on Ethereum itself is never going to be cheap.  It is a reality that we have to live with.  In fact, lately gas has been about as cheap as it ever will be moving forward.

# - The Merge and Gas

It is a misconception that the merge will lower gas fees. It will not. I mean, block validation times will get reduced by around a second or so, but that will only have very minimal and irrelevant effects on gas prices.

# 

# - Sharding and Gas

Sharding, which was originally designed to reduce gas across the board, has been changed. The Ethereum roadmap is now fully layer-2 (more precisely rollup) centric, and with that danksharding will be the way forward.

Again, Ethereum itself won’t be affected by this. What Sharding will do however is drastically help L2s lower their already low gas fees even further.But that’s alright because Ethereum is fully adopting L2s and scaling solutions as part of the blockchain.

As a reaction to that, we’re starting to see a lot of funds and developments being applied by Ethereum scaling solutions. already seeing some scaling solutions like Polygon alone is already sitting on a massive arsenal of scaling solutions with 8 of them ready to scale Ethereum and an open source zkEVM on the way that will help Solidity developers benefit from Ethereum’s security and Polygon’s efficiency.

Sharding will most likely arrive and be fully implemented in 2023 - 2024 so hang in there. (This is considering that everything goes as planned and no delays happen, which is usually not the case).

&#x200B;

There will also be further network optimization planned down the line. All of them are designed for the goal of further reducing gas costs and making Ethereum a much more efficient network overall.",262.0,2022-07-29 16:12:23,0.86

Why is ETC still alive and making some occasional pumps?,"Basically the title.

"The Merge is just around the corner, how's everyone feeling?","Just to preface before the haters fly in, I own Ethereum and support the project, I am discussing the merge and going over consensus algos voicing my thoughts and opinions.

With the merge coming up there's been a ton of discussion about PoS, how will it work, what are the benefits, why did they swap, etc. PoS is a consensus system implemented to continue the scalability of Etherreum (you can find a million sources to explain it), I understand why the choice was made and respect it, but for the sake of discussion I wanted to talk about other consensus algos.

Proof of Work (PoW) is what Ethereum is currently using, the same as BTC. You mine the token, receive it, and do whatever you want. Wanna earn more tokens, spend more money on mining equipment to mine more tokens, pretty straight forward. The benefits are large holders would need to invest millions upon millions in equipment to hold a large market share. Not only this, PoW also has the possibility of mining invalid blocks which lead to a loss.

To keep it simple, PoS eliminates one of the biggest downsides to PoW which is the equipment expense. Obtain the token and stake it to receive more and support the network. The issue however, is that large holders may simply stake their Ethereum for as long as they want, controlling a large market share and reducing the rewards for everyone involved. The more people stake, the worse the rewards.

Aside from PoW and PoS, there's also other consensus algorithms like Analog's Proof-Of-Time (PoT) concept which uses a ranking score and time-based technology to validate their nodes. Potentially preventing hacks more efficiently than other mechanisms. Solanas Proof-Of-History (PoH) consensus that utilizes time stamps to validate events and transactions, and then hashing them to make inputs difficult to predict, etc.

The issues with other options of course are things like security of the network itself, the technology may be flawed, and of course, the lack of decentralization.

Regardless, I wanted to know what everyone thinks. Is PoS the best option for the merge? If so, then why? Could there have been another route Ethereum took to evolve? Let me know your opinions",320.0,2022-07-28 01:48:07,0.87
"I built a ""decentralized facebook connect"" powered by blockchain wallets, 100% open source.","Hi Reddit, just wanted to share a project I've been working on. It's called Privateparty:

https://privateparty.dev

It's like Facebook connect, but decentralized. Instead of using a centralized identity system like Facebook to log into an app, this framework lets you easily add blockchain wallet based authentication and authorization to any web app, effortlessly. And it's super simple to use, just a couple of lines of code.

And most importantly, it's 100% open source (MIT licensed) and permissionless --- there is NO proprietary API or service provider you need to rely on.

Just to be clear, this is different from the typical ""connect with wallet"" feature in that it's not just about connecting a frontend with a wallet to make transactions, but it actually ""logs you in"" to any backend app with cookies and token authentication, and you can login once and keep using the session, just like any regular web app.

Things you can do:

1. NFT gated apps
2. ERC20 gated apps
3. Allow list authorized apps
4. A regular login experience, just replacing username/password with wallet login
5. Anything. you can build your own authorization logic with just a few lines of code.

Would appreciate any feedback and questions!

"Since zkEVM has been a hot topic the past couple of weeks, let’s talk about it. What is zkEVM?","I’ve seen more than a couple zkEVM related posts on this sub the past couple weeks and apparently there’s a considerable number of people that don’t fully understand what zkEVM.

For this purpose, I won’t be using complicated and complex technical words as a lot of people didn’t understand them.

I’ll be using more of a “layman’s terms” kind of explanation just to help people understand what zkEVM is/does before they personally dive into technicals

(Would love to make another post that dives deep into technical terms and explanations if you guys demand one).

&#x200B;

So let’s start!We first have to understand

# - What is a rollup?

There are two ways to scale Ethereum.(Channels or Sidechains)

Channels are full secured by Ethereum however they work well for only a very specific set of applications.

Sidechains on the other hand can scale general purpose applications however they are less secure than layer 2 solutions as they don’t rely on the security of Ethereum but rather on their own consensus model.

Rollups (the vast majority of them) can achieve the best of what Channels and Sidechains have to offer while eliminating the drawbacks that come along with them by creating a general purpose scaling solutions while still full relying on Ethereum’s security.

&#x200B;

# - What is zero-knowledge (ZK)?

A zero-knowledge rollup (as the name implies) offers users a lot more privacy when doing transactions. The way the technology is built allows validators to prove that “yes this transaction is legit and true” without having to disclose private or sensitive information to said validators.

To make it simple I’ll give out a fun exampleYou and your friend are standing in front of two rooms. These two rooms have a connecting door from the inside but that door is protected by a code that only you know.

You want to show your friend that you know the code but you don’t want to share the code with him. Based on this, you go inside one room, close the door behind you and press the code for the connecting door which leads you to the other room, thus proving to your friend that you do indeed know the code without having to disclose the actual code for him.

Its a fun example that helps you understand why zero-knowledge is so important. It’s all about benefiting from the quickness and efficiency of rollups while also benefiting from the privacy that ZK offers.

&#x200B;

# - What is EVM?

EVM is an acronym for “Ethereum Virtual Machine”. It is the software machine for the Ethereum’s network.EVM basically allows developers to create smart contracts using the Solidity coding language.

So why is everyone so psyched about EVM equivalence? Because it comes with huge advantages. Mainly things like compatibility with Metamask wallets, and the fact that it makes devs’ jobs much easier since they’re already familiar with Solidity

&#x200B;

# - Some names to mention regarding zkEVM are (I’ll have to mention some technical words here, sorry):

zkSync and Polygon Hermez

Now I have to say that although zkSync has had their zkEVM testnet live for months, it is closed source which sadly defeats the entire purpose of zkEVM.

Polygon Hermez on the other hand is open source which is great for the Ethereum chain and developers.

There’s been some recent controversy regarding Polygon zkEVM being EVM-compatible and not EVM-equivalent. The main argument is that if you're a developer a few functions breaking over not being 100% equivalent may result in a dApp crashing. However, this argument is irrelevant for a simply reason.

Hermez is bytecode equivalent. They run that bytecode on their own custom zkASM.  That allows direct compatibility with existing dApps. Those dApps should run without any problem since they’re completely bytecode equivalent. This might be extra work for the nodes to put in to validate and write the block that isn't equivalent but it really shouldn’t be a problem. Main argument is that the devs can't literally copy paste their code off Ethereum, but they literally shouldn't do that anywhere, there should be always revisions when migrating contracts to make sure everything goes smoothly.What Polygon is doing is of great value for Ethereum and its ecosystem and devs overall.

Phew! That might have been the longest post I’ve written but I really hope that it gives people a quick idea idea about what zkEVM is and why it’s so important for Ethereum.

Again, this was all in layman’s terms but I’d love to follow up with a post that dives into technicalities if popular demand says so.",254.0,2022-07-25 13:23:06,0.92
How web3 protocols built on Ethereum can solve web2 social media issues,"[Article](https://medium.com/@0xAlfon/how-web3-can-solve-social-media-issues-434167c4b1fc)

In summary web3 would solve:

1. Opening the social graph and descentralisation can help limiting algorithm manipulation and empowering users to take control over their social graph and social footprint.

2. By storing relationships and activity on chain, users can monitor and monetise their activity without intermediators. For instance, apps built on top of Lens Protocol (desgined by Aave team) can provide monetisation solutions to users curating content. This opens a new asset class.

3. Bots can manipulate the graph and artificially generate social content, provoke tensions, or produce fake traffic. Digital IDs can help to limit the activity of programs and algorithms simulating human behaviour providing reliable private digital identities.",54.0,2022-07-24 19:27:19,0.84

Decentralized ETH?,"When people criticize ETH not being decentralized, what are they referring to? And what's the counterargument that it is in fact decentralized?",33.0,2022-07-24 10:57:45,0.84
"Ethereum was created for a real purpose, not for dog coins and pictures of monkeys…","I’m not going to name drop any tokens in particular to not p#ss off a certain group of people but I think we all know that memecoins serve no real purpose and derive no real value other than community hype and nothing more. This is a fact and it is undisputed.

I really don’t want to be that guy that says “this money would be better off invested in XYZ”. Its not about greed and “funds” in particular. Its more about development.

Vitalik created this blockchain to serve a purpose. To fight against tyranny and give regular human beings a tool to leverage financial freedom through decentralization and smart contracts.

This might be considered subjective to some people but DeFi and DAOs have much more value than a token with a dog face on it.

When you can use AAVE to take out a loan  anytime of the day regardless of you location, ethnicity, gender or age, that give Ethereum value. When there are platforms like Bitdao where the community governs itself and votes for what they see fit for themselves as holder, that reinforces Ethereum’s decentralization ideals.

It’s a bit ironic of me to be talking about “freedom” and “decentralization” while at the same time condoning memecoins and hypecoins, I know.  
I’m not advocating against these coins entirely, I just think that obsession over them defeats the main purpose of Ethereum.

Technically you could use Ethereum for anything (and that’s what makes it so valuable) but I think it makes much more sense to use it in a utilitarian way.  


But that’s all just my personal opinion.",463.0,2022-07-23 12:12:16,0.73
Zero Knowledge Proofs is HUGE (via Pete Huang),"Big day yesterday! Three blockchain teams made announcements all in one day!  


All of them working on solutions that use zero-knowledge proofs (that thing I said would change blockchain forever):  


1. Polygon announced Polygon zkEVM  
2. Scroll announced their pre-alpha  
3. zkSync announced they are ""100 days away"" from full launch  


Ok, so they're not \*real\* announcements since one of them announced a comically early version of their product and another announced that... they will announce the actual thing later(?)  


Stick with me here. Let me dive into the significance of these milestones so that we can make sense of why these products are important.  


**Part 1:** Ethereum is really slow. 35 transactions per second. There's this idea that we can use ""rollups"" to scale Ethereum: these are separate blockchains that specialize in packing a ton of transactions into 1 of those 35 so that Ethereum can process more stuff at once.  


**Part 2:** Zero-knowledge proofs are one way to implement those rollups. They essentially calculate some crazy math and send that math to Ethereum. Ethereum checks the math (which is way, way faster than checking the actual stuff that happened) and says, ""Ok cool, I'm gonna fast forward the tape!""  


**Part 3:** But the rollups are limited right now. Specifically, the rollups are either designed for very specific use cases (e.g., exchanges and nothing else) or you have to use a different type of computer than the one Ethereum uses (which can be really complicated).  


For these types of rollups to work well, we need to build one that thinks like Ethereum's computer thinks, while supporting every use case that Ethereum can support, while supporting the same programming language that Ethereum supports, while spitting out that crazy math.  


Whew.  


But that's what these teams are working on. The ""Ethereum computer"" is called the EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine) and these teams are working on zkEVMs - EVMs with zero-knowledge proofs (that crazy math) embedded.  


Each has a different approach to writing these zkEVMs. For example, one approach is to make each individual command in the EVM spit out a zk version of that individual command. Another approach is to literally rewrite each individual command to a zk verison.  


**The summary:** finally, we'll have a zero-knowledge rollup that scales Ethereum, is easy-to-use by developers (they can literally copy and paste code instead of having to rewrite it) and supports any use case (vs. existing ones that only do certain things).  


The infrastructure continues to improve!

"Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin said on Thursday that Ethereum will be about 55% complete after the “merge,” when the network moves from proof-of-work (PoW) to a proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus system.","Proof of stake is much more secure than proof of work, but it does have its tradeoffs,” like weak subjectivity, Buterin said at the Ethereum Community Conference (EthCC) in Paris, Fortune reported.
Buterin said the difference between Bitcoin and Ethereum is that Bitcoin is considered to be 80% complete in terms of development.
Ethereum, on the other hand, is considered to be only about 40% complete at the moment, which will increase post-merge.

**Frequently Asked Questions**

**Where's the best place to buy ETH?**

There are many centralized exchanges that support Ethereum. If you live in the US, the most popular exchanges are Coinbase, Gemeni and Kraken. Coinbase users can use Coinbase Pro for lower fees.

**When is Eth2 launching?**

Eth2 is a marketing term used to represent a number of updates to Ethereum. The Eth2 proof-of-stake chain first launched in December 2020. ""The Merge"", which is the event that will fully switch Ethereum's consensus to proof-of-stake, is estimated to be ready in early 2022, although there is no exact timeline. Other updates, such as data shards, will follow that update.

Visit [ethmerge.com](https://ethmerge.com/) to learn more about ""The Merge"".

**Do I need to do anything to update to Eth2? Will Eth2 create a new token?**

No, ETH holders *never* need to take any action to keep holding ETH. Ethereum users will be unaffected by the Eth2 upgrade. And the Eth2 updates will not create any new tokens.

**How can I stake my ETH?**

The best way to stake your ETH: by running your own validator.

* Running your own validator requires a modern computer and 32 ETH. Visit /r/ethstaker for more details

**Why are Ethereum transaction fees so high?**

Like most blockchains, Ethereum fees are determined by supply-and-demand. The large demand to use Ethereum has pushed transaction fees quite high (however, fees were just a few cents only 2 years ago). Fees are especially high during market volatility, and during NFT drops.

**What is being done to lower Ethereum transaction fees?**

Ethereum fees are reduced by using layer-2 rollups. Rollups are scaling solutions that allow for significantly cheaper transactions, while still maintaining Ethereum's security.

Additionally, Eth2's data shards will make rollups even cheaper.

While rollups are cutting-edge technology being actively developed, a number are already live on Ethereum mainnet. Visit [l2beat.com](https://l2beat.com/) to learn more about rollups.

**What's the best wallet for Ethereum?**

The most popular tool for using decentralized applications is Metamask. However, for security reasons, we recommend using a hardware wallet such as a Trezor or Ledger.

I went onto their social platforms to ask about it and one of the core team members immediately delivered an unprofessional remark against me then banned me with no warning. I must have hit a nerve, because it's true. But to see such unprofessionalism from a ""proper"" team is surprising.

Yet they have the audacity to talk about decentralization and community. Stay away folks, this is a dumpster fire waiting to happen.

“ETH killers” will start losing relevancy once zkEVM gets fully integrated by every major scaling solution,"There’s no doubt that Ethereum is the gold standard of decentralization, reliability, and ecosystem diversity when it comes to blockchains. However, its main drawback ever since it went popular was efficiency with time and gas fees.

“ETH killers” profit off of this and basically make their only selling point centered around efficiency even if that’s at the price of decentralization or ecosystem diversity. And apparently, some people found that appealing because some of these projects found success to some extent.

However, this will all change slowly but surely. Down the line, we’ll start seeing a completely different Ethereum that will morph into a blockchain that is way more efficient than we got used to and this is all due to the major ZK technology development that we’re seeing.

Loopring and Starware have very exciting developments in the zero-knowledge department that many fans are waiting for.

Polygon has also had major breakthroughs with zkEVM development and will soon be dropping Hermez 2.0 which will help Ethereum scale like nothing before. This is also not mentioning the Plonky2 tech which will apparently be the fastest in terms of transaction speed by a long shot.

All of the efforts of these scaling solutions combined will make Ethereum unrecognizable to us and will eventually shut up the critics. But most importantly, the developments in the zkEVM field will make claims of an “ETH killer” something of the past.",349.0,2022-07-13 08:28:09,0.83
"Founders Of Bankrupt Crypto Hedge Fund 3AC Go Missing, As Investors Try To Recoup Assets"," The co-founders of failed crypto hedge fund Three Arrows Capital appear to be on the run from creditors, according to court documents recently filed in New York.

Lawyers representing the creditors say the physical whereabouts of Zhu Su and Kyle Davies, who started Three Arrows in 2012, are “currently unknown,” ahead of a hearing that is scheduled for 9 a.m. ET Tuesday to discuss next steps in the liquidation process. The documents, filed Friday evening, also allege that the founders have not yet begun to cooperate with the liquidation process “in any meaningful manner.” On Monday, lawyers requested the court keep the identity of the creditors anonymous.

Zhu and Davies did not respond to requests for comment.

Three Arrows, also known as 3AC, managed about $10 billion in assets as recently as March. On July 1, the firm filed for Chapter 15 bankruptcy protection from U.S. creditors in the Southern District of New York, after a plunge in cryptocurrencies and the collapse of the terraUSD (UST) stablecoin project wiped out its assets.

Prior to the bankruptcy filing, a court in the British Virgin Islands ordered the beleaguered fund to liquidate in order to pay back its debts.

What was the best strategy for whales providing single-sided liquidity on Bancor?," 

Recently the pioneers of AMM and impermanent loss protection have been in huge trouble. Their impermanent loss protection has led to a huge deficit, over $40 million at its peak, and still has a deficit of $34,242,036 today. In the process, some people want to ask what was the best strategy for whales or retail investors providing single-sided liquidity on Bancor? Here are a few options, so you can decide which is best:

1) Just holding until removing liquidity forever;

2) Removing and re-adding when there is a large fluctuation;

3) Removing and re-adding when there is a large fluctuation, and shorting BNT at the same time.

I think many people actually choose 1, and smart investors may choose 2. But the best option is actually 3 for whales. For example, the crisis of BNT is due to the selling and shorting BNT by whales while removing single-sided liquidity. The whales were rewarded by a large number of BNT causing the price to plummet while sold; At the same time shorting also makes an additional profit for them. So this is the best strategy for whales to provide liquidity on bancor. As we all know, the inflation of BNT is calculated as followed:

Indicating that you can get BNT rewards for any price fluctuations.

So strategy 2 should be better selected for ordinary investors. It can be obtained double BNT rewards in the fluctuation, which maximizes the benefits.

A Slow Unexpected Death for Mirror.xyz: Mirror Investment Memo,"Despite raising capital from Tier 1 VCs such as Union Square Ventures, Andreessen Horozwitz, Atelier Ventures (now part of Variant Fund) the platform seems to be dying a slow death. 

Whilst Mirror got off to a great start with $WRITE RACE driving FOMO and onboarding some of the most respected names in crypto including Jarrod Dicker, Linda Xie, Coophatroppa and Chris Dixon their performance has struggled recently. 

Since opening up the platform (October 13th, 2021), Mirror has seen disappointing growth in the number of writers of its platform – going from 380 to 607 writers. This represents ≈60% in 7.5 months or 6.45% MoM. Contrast this to Substack, Mirror's web2 counterparty that has ‘*hundreds of thousands of* ***paid*** *newsletters on the platform’* according to The Times. 

The situation becomes bleaker when digging deeper on Dune and comparing them to Juicebox.eth, a crypto fundraising platform. Whilst Juicebox may be less well known and have a less diverse product line-up they are significantly outperforming their competition.

We’ve seen that companies like Substack, despite far greater adoption are generating disappointing revenue ($9m in 2021) and have struggled to raise a Series C.

https://preview.redd.it/597mjxpjz0a91.png?width=1456&format=png&auto=webp&s=343e28c718d9d3112709c8259777830eec22e05a

So whilst the ‘Content Creation’ market TAMs are extremely attractive (projected to reach $38.2 billion by 2030) this comes with major caveats.

1. This includes far more popular means including VOD (YouTube) and Live Streaming (Twitch)
2. We’ve seen that the media industry is a pretty horrible business for venture capital
3. Substack shows there is not a massive market for supporting individual writers

However, Mirror may be missing a trick. I think there is a far greater market opportunity if they were to position themselves as a tool to raise money (for personal projects or crypto businesses).

&#x200B;

**The Crowdfunding Market** 

Over recent years we’ve seen the popularisation of private market investing whether through the likes of Kickstarter, investment DAOs, angel investing or new start-ups like SeedInvest & EquityZen.

The crowdfunding market alone is estimated at $12.27 billion globally and is forecasted to double by 2027, growing at a CAGR of 11%. Crypto, in my opinion, will enable and accelerate this (look to “Business as a Game” by Not Boring).

So, where should Mirror go from here?

Understanding data availability for zk rollups,"My understanding is that if a zkrollup operator suddenly ceases operation, you have to sync the rollup’s history from genesis to get the current state. In other words, if the transaction data has been posted to 500 ethereum blocks, you would need all the data from all 500 blocks to recreate current state. Is this correct?

If that's correct, how do we make sense of Ethereum's eventual plan to only make data available for a few weeks and then prune? Wouldn't the data need to be made available indefinitely (because you need all data from genesis to recreate the zkrollup state)?  
Any help here would be appreciated.",20.0,2022-07-06 03:58:57,0.93
What happens if a major Internet artery is cut off?,"What happens if major Internet arteries are cut off splitting the Internet service between North America and Asia which then causes the mined blocks to diverge between both continents?

What happens if the Internet connection resumes after 20 minutes and what if the Internet connection resumes after 2 days?

What if the artery was not completely cut off but there remained a slow and throttled connection between both continents connected by a weak satellite?

"Building a web app showing new useful crypto apps built every day, would you guys use it?","Hi guys,

I’ve been in the crypto community for quite some time now but what I often hear is the uselessness of crypto.

While it may be true I think for lots of tokens, I see lots of useful apps being built or that have been built that solves issues for their users.

I thought that if I build a web app focused on list of new crypto apps everyday trying to solve issues for their customers instead of promoting their tokens would be of interest to some people.

Help me understand L2 impact on ETH fees,"So I've been an ETH investor for a while, but I'm trying to DYOR yet again. I like the DCF model for ETH, but obviously one of the concerns is how much the L2 solutions will decrease ETH L1 fees overall. L2 is great for user adoption and there are some promising prospects there. But, as more dapps move to L2, the volume/fees on L1 decrease and lower the DCF (maybe).

The loss of BNT impermanent loss protection is even larger than the loss of market price fluctuation,"Recently, bancor as the pioneer of AMM and impermanent loss protection has been in huge trouble with huge deficits over $40 million at its peak due to hostile market conditions. As we all know normal impermanent loss is just only 20% even with 80% price down, which is why the author said that the impermanence loss protection of bancor exceeds the impermanence loss itself. If you are interested, you can refer to the previous analysis article.

But some people want to know which is bigger for the loss of impermanent loss protection and market price fluctuations? We know that the volatility loss of the market is ML(%)=P0/Pn-1, that is, we need to compare the sizes of the following two formulas:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/lxgp5s6rw3991.png?width=480&format=png&auto=webp&s=eb93649e3d4d07d89769e5a963be5eb6b347a2cb

wherein P0 is the initial price and Pn is the current price.

As can be seen from the figure below, when Pn/P0<0.3, the loss of impermanent loss protection will exceed the loss of price fluctuations. And the loss of impermanent loss protection is as high as 250% which is far exceeding the decreasing of BNT price just only 85% from April 3 to July 2. Therefore, the loss of BNT impermanent loss protection is not only higher than impermanent loss itself, but also would even exceed the decline in market prices. Under extreme conditions, the hyperinflation of BNT will increase exponentially, and you may lose all your capital.

I know that there’s a lot of rivalry between scaling solution and L2 communities however they all have one thing in common and that is to make Ethereum a better place,"I get that the rivalry between L1 communities could be justified to some extent (even though I think that competition and diversity is a great thing for us, the consumers) but I really don’t get the rivalry and tribalism between L2 communities. Aren’t we all working for the same exact goal? To improve Ethereum?

There’s no deny that certain L2s and scaling solutions are simply better than the other be it because of more funding, longer time in the market or a better development team over all.

I personally root a lot for Polygon considering that they have the most funding and liquidity out of all other scaling solutions (and thats apparent by their allocation of $1 billion toward ZK tech development) plus they also have more than 8 Ethereum scaling solutions each with its specific purpose. Finally they already secured a ton of partnerships with major global companies the likes of Instagram, Stripe and recently Bentley.

My love for this scaling solution does NOT disregard other L2s and scaling solutions. I know that they are JUST AS IMPORTANT as this one. I just happen to support Polygon more.

But the tribalism (especially within the Ethereum ecosystem) needs to end. I’m in full support of any development that happens with Loopring, Zksync, Starkware or any other Ethereum scaling solutions working hard and sinking funds into making Ethereum a better place for us as consumers and supporters of Ethereum.",36.0,2022-07-01 10:45:19,0.76

North Korean Hackers Reportedly Behind the $100 Million Harmony Exploit,"
The Lazarus Group, a notorious North Korean hacking group, is suspected of attacking the cryptocurrency protocol Harmony. The criminal organization has been involved in a number of similar heists in recent years and there has no been an ideal way of tracing crypto transaction with ideas like ID recognition presented forward by Concordium not generally adopted. 

Harmony revealed last week that wrongdoers breached its Horizon Bridge and drained approximately $100 million in Ethereum. Harmony's team quickly launched a ""global manhunt"" for the perpetrators of the attack. 

According to Bloomberg, Elliptic Enterprises, a firm that tracks stolen digital assets, stated that the exploit was most likely carried out by the Lazarus Group (a cybercrime entity backed by the North Korean state). According to the company, the laundering methods were very similar to previous hacking maneuvers: ""There are strong indications that North Korea’s Lazarus Group may be responsible for this theft, based on the nature of the hack and the subsequent laundering of the stolen funds.”

Elliptic also went into great detail about how the heist was carried out. To breach the protocol's security system, the Lazarus Group targeted the username and password credentials of Harmony employees in the Asia Pacific region. Once in control, the criminals used automated laundering services to move the stolen assets at night. 

Elliptic also claimed that the hacking group had already transferred more than 40% of the $100 million to a Tornado Cash mixer. According to a recent Coincub study, North Korea is by far the top-ranked nation for crypto crime. Between 2017 and 2022, skilled hackers from the totalitarian country targeted governments and private companies all over the world, stealing more than $1.5 billion in digital assets. Despite repeated warnings and harsh sanctions, Pyongyang has maintained its ballistic missile infrastructure: “DPRK demonstrated increased capabilities for rapid deployment, wide mobility (including at sea), and improved resilience of its missile forces.”  Unsurprisingly, Russia and China refused to sign the UN statement, which accuses North Korea of using stolen crypto assets to fund its nuclear tests.",411.0,2022-06-30 18:15:22,0.93

I didn't realize TrustWallet was created by Binance until today.,"From the TrustWallet website it has the hallmarks of every other crypto product out there:

So I thought it was the same as every other generic wallet app like Coin98 Wallet or SimpleHold wallet.

But then after clicking around on the Binance website, I discovered that Binance calls TrustWallet their own wallet app. So Binance goes to all this length to make TrustWallet seem like every other crypto wallet.

**Frequently Asked Questions**

**Where's the best place to buy ETH?**

There are many centralized exchanges that support Ethereum. If you live in the US, the most popular exchanges are Coinbase, Gemeni and Kraken. Coinbase users can use Coinbase Pro for lower fees.

**When is Eth2 launching?**

Eth2 is a marketing term used to represent a number of updates to Ethereum. The Eth2 proof-of-stake chain first launched in December 2020. ""The Merge"", which is the event that will fully switch Ethereum's consensus to proof-of-stake, is estimated to be ready in early 2022, although there is no exact timeline. Other updates, such as data shards, will follow that update.

Visit [ethmerge.com](https://ethmerge.com/) to learn more about ""The Merge"".

**Do I need to do anything to update to Eth2? Will Eth2 create a new token?**

No, ETH holders *never* need to take any action to keep holding ETH. Ethereum users will be unaffected by the Eth2 upgrade. And the Eth2 updates will not create any new tokens.

**How can I stake my ETH?**

The best way to stake your ETH: by running your own validator.

* Running your own validator requires a modern computer and 32 ETH. Visit /r/ethstaker for more details

**Why are Ethereum transaction fees so high?**

Like most blockchains, Ethereum fees are determined by supply-and-demand. The large demand to use Ethereum has pushed transaction fees quite high (however, fees were just a few cents only 2 years ago). Fees are especially high during market volatility, and during NFT drops.

**What is being done to lower Ethereum transaction fees?**

Ethereum fees are reduced by using layer-2 rollups. Rollups are scaling solutions that allow for significantly cheaper transactions, while still maintaining Ethereum's security.

Additionally, Eth2's data shards will make rollups even cheaper.

While rollups are cutting-edge technology being actively developed, a number are already live on Ethereum mainnet. Visit [l2beat.com](https://l2beat.com/) to learn more about rollups.

**What's the best wallet for Ethereum?**

The most popular tool for using decentralized applications is Metamask. However, for security reasons, we recommend using a hardware wallet such as a Trezor or Ledger.

permissoned zkRollup with private smart contract?,"Hey guys!

Recently, I deal with ETH scalability solutions and I started to read more about zkRollup. All found solutions are permissionless and do not deal with privacy (except Zcash which allows anonymous transactions).

In my opinion, zkRollup can be easily used as a permissioned/consortium system. The basic implementation to make this kind of system is not a big deal. My main problem is privacy and group handling.

Except for the global public state (public contracts), each group has to deal with its own contracts and do its own zk proof generation. Thus, it seems to be an enormous waste. I do not think it is a good approach to the problem. Sidechains and plasma can be a better choice.

Requirements: the new system has to be capable of transferring (mainnet's) Ethereum assets, executing public/private smart contracts, and storing some states or proof on the mainnet.

What is your opinion about this idea?

Zero-knowledge tech is way more private than optimistic tech. This is exactly we’re seeing more ZK development on Ethereum,"This doesn’t mean that optimistic tech is bad. On the contrary, as opposed to what many think, optimistic tech will ALWAYS be an important and integral part of Ethereum and will never go away.

However, it does lack a little when it comes to privacy. Compared to zero-knowledge, optimistic tech isn’t as private considering that validators have access to the information related to you/your transactions.

This isn’t the case with zero-knowledge. Validators have the minimal needed amount of information needed to validate a transaction in a way that can’t be linked to you as a person, hence the name “zero-knowledge” because all transactions looks the same to a validator, they just have to confirm if the transaction is valid or not.

Zero-knowledge doesn’t only stop at crypto transactions though. Some platforms like Polygon took it a step further and integrated into identification through Polygon ID.

Its currently a bit difficult to prove your identity without having to disclose sensitive information. But zero-knowledge solves that. With ZK-proof any user can prove that “yes this is me” without having without having to disclose personal information.  
This is a HUGE use case that crypto projects can benefit from as there’s still no solutions for this problem outside of the crypto space and this is exactly what Polygon is capitalizing on with Polygon ID. You can literally use it verify your identity anywhere from Metaverse ecosystems, real world business, social media, Fintech services and platforms that require KYC.

You know what this means right? With Ethereum being famous for extreme secure, zero-knowledge will soon attract institutions and businesses into the crypto world bringing a ton of new money into the market and more specifically Ethereum!",354.0,2022-06-23 09:32:29,0.9
Did the Metaverse hype come at the wrong time?," We all know that everything is down and not going well in the meantime and [Metaverse projects](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethtrader/comments/uengau/different_crypto_metaverse_projects_everywhere/) and [Meme coins](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/slyrih/shit_coins/) that I am aware of, suffered the most losses in May.  Because metaverse projects are still relatively new, it appears that the hype for meta projects is occurring at an inconvenient time, such as when NFTs and P2Es boomed. Yuga labs experienced this because after they dropped the Otherside Metaverse, the price dropped significantly after a week last month. Some people in third-world countries even used it as their primary source of income, but the bear market is making everyone shit their pants right now. Even the $20k support was recently broken, and ETH fell below $1000 for the first time since 2021.   
Decentralized metaverse projects took advantage of the popularity of Play-to-Earn as well as the hype surrounding virtual worlds to create their digital realms prior to the announcements of tech titans in this field. Decentraland, in fact, is a pioneer in this space, having opened its metaverse to the public in February 2020. Another popular solution, Sandbox, debuted its first multiplayer alpha season in November 2021. A lot of great Metaverse projects are incoming as well with great features like Kirin’s open-source platform that will provide Learn to earn, Play to earn, etc, that are made for gamers and devs, and Star Atlas’s graphics and gaming experience. But sadly, the popularity of Metaverses just increased much more recently than P2Es.  
But the question is, will the bear market have a massive effect on the development of great Metaverse projects? At this rate, I realized many altcoins will probably not make it, on the other hand, the bear market serves an even more important function in the crypto industry: they are when the greatest and most successful projects are built.

I feel like no one outside of our industry actually understands blockchain tech,"I've been noticing this for a while: but everyone in tech who doesn't work in the blockchain industry seems to be critical of the tech. Yet when you read their critiques they fail to touch on anything that the tech is being used for.

For example someone could say: 'look at escrow contracts. Why bother with that. It's far cheaper and faster just to use lawyers.' This would be a targeted critique because it would be focusing on something particular to blockchain tech. After-all, you can't take a piece of regular money and write a set of conditions for using it.

What we get instead seems to be cherry picked arguments about bad things that have happened in the crypto industry, generalizations there-of, fallacies, and a complete lack of understanding about what the tech is about (if you want to see how many uninformed people there are look no further than [http://concerned.tech/](http://concerned.tech/).)

A good case in point is the repeat claim that 'blockchains have no use-cases.' But what this means is the person is fundamentally so uneducated about the tech that they don't even know the basics. Consequently, the only way to address such a person would be to write a huge post starting from the fundamentals of digital property, smart contracts, decentralized \[systems, organisations, etc\] each time someone makes the claim (which is very impractical.)

I think what we need is for someone to make a post that lists a bunch of use-cases in simple terms, current unique projects in the space \[representative there-of\], along with the over-all philosophy and goals. Then we can just link to it every time someone posts these misleading claims. Because people are just going to assume that because no one is taking the effort to educate outsiders about the massive amounts of industry-specific knowledge it indicates there is none. These people then go and write article after article and form self-congratulatory echo chambers of ignoramuses.

Gas fees are at record lows. Imagine that after Sharding is introduced this will become the norm,"Consistently low gas fees have always been a dream to many people on Ethereum and right now its starting to look more like a reality that will happen in due time.

Gas fees have been a plague to Ethereum and always have been one of the major criticisms regarding Ethereum’s performance. And this is exactly why I’m so bullish on Sharding.  
This will make Ethereum much more sustainable and operable without having to compromise security.

If you think you like the low gas fees right now then imagine if this actually became the norm.

This might come sooner rather than later and it’s starting to look apparent by how much development has been happening with some scalability leaders like Polygon. They’re shifting a lot of their funds and efforts towards Zk development right now which isn’t really a surprise considering Ethereum will be following a Zk rollup centric roadmap as Vitalik once noted.

In fact, the majority of scaling solutions like Zksync, Loopring and Starkware are also very Zk centric.

An Ethereum with low gas fees would be all we need right now. We’ve been asking for this for a very long time and we might be receiving it very soon.",305.0,2022-06-20 20:20:39,0.83

"Whoever has doubts about Ethereum’s future… calm down, it still has a ton of development on the way from merging to sharding to much more","Call me biased if you want but I don’t think any other blockchain is as consistent and safe as Ethereum especially when you take into consideration that it has the most diverse and rich ecosystem in the entire market.

The only people who have fears are the ones that still aren’t used to how the market moves in times like this, but the reality is that this might be one of the most bullish phases for Ethereum considering how much development is on the way.

The merge isn’t that far away right now and it will make Ethereum WAY more efficient with around 99% less energy consumption.

Sharding will come after that and will basically put all scaling solutions on steroids, especially ones that are ZK-based.

It's no wonder why so many L2s and scaling solutions are starting to shift towards ZK tech, a lot of them starting t develop some neat stuff. Polygon out of all been at the forefront of ZK development with more than $1 billion allocated just for that and even 4 ZK-based scaling solutions in their arsenal right now.

This will make gas fees a redundant issue and will make Ethereum unrecognizable. So if you’ve always liked Ethereum then you’re going to love it pretty soon.

Why Bridging Ethereum Domains is So Damn Difficult,"#  Bridging Ethereum

This post will attempt to explain why interoperability between Ethereum domains is difficult, and from there show why we think NXTP represents the beginning of a true long-term solution for the ecosystem. 

 NXTP - [protocol for enabling fully trustless transfers and contract calls between Ethereum-compatible domains](https://medium.com/connext/nxtp-a-simpler-xchain-protocol-88760697ea04) (domains = chains & L2s). 

# The Need for Trustless Ethereum Interoperability

Multichain/L2 Ethereum is here, and it’s here to stay. This has spurred the creation of dozens of new bridges and interoperability protocols as projects have scrambled to enable this functionality for DeFi.

As can be expected, this has also brought on a number of high profile hacks and scams:

* The multiple Thorchain hacks.
* The PolyNetwork hack.

Despite these examples, every bridging system out there markets itself as trustless, secure, and decentralized (even if that’s not at all the case). This means big challenge for developers and users is now, “how can I figure out which bridging mechanisms are actually cryptoeconomically secure?”

In other words, how can users discern between types of bridges to determine who they are trusting when moving funds between chains?

## What Does “Trustless” Actually Mean in Cryptoeconomics?

In the research community, when we talk about cryptoeconomic security and the property of trustlessness, we are really asking one very specific question:

>*Who is verifying the system and how much does it cost to corrupt them?*

If our goal is to build truly decentralized, uncensorable public goods, then we have to consider that our systems could be attacked by incredibly powerful adversaries like rogue sovereign nations, megacorporations, or megalomaniacal evil geniuses.

Maximizing security means maximizing the number and diversity of verifiers (validators, miners, etc.) in your system, and this typically means trying your best to have a system that is verified entirely by Ethereum’s validator set. This is the core idea behind L2 and Ethereum’s approach to scalability.

>*Aside: Most people don’t realize this, but scalability research is interoperability research. We’ve known we can scale by moving to multiple domains for ages, the problem has always been how to enable communicating to those domains trustlessly. That’s why John Adler’s seminal paper on optimistic rollups is titled, “Trustless Two-Way Bridges With Sidechains By Halting”.*

## What Happens If We Add New Verifiers Between Domains?

Let’s take what we’ve learned above about cryptoeconomic security and apply it to bridges.

https://preview.redd.it/mdawgg4atj691.png?width=757&format=png&auto=webp&s=7010e8a1e01f4a235b45db893caa2ed875e765c7

Consider a scenario where you have your funds on Arbitrum. You’ve specifically chosen to use this domain because it is a rollup, meaning that (with some reasonable assumptions) your funds are fully secured by Ethereum’s underlying verifiers. In other words, your funds are about as cryptoeconomically secure as they can possibly be in the blockchain ecosystem.

Now imagine that you decide to use a bridge to move your funds cheaply and quickly to Optimism. Optimism is also trustless, so you feel comfortable having your funds there knowing that they will share the same level of security (Ethereum’s security) that they do on Arbitrum.

https://preview.redd.it/jrlpfozbtj691.png?width=751&format=png&auto=webp&s=2d651026edc6dab716b6f65bf9c0920080fdacc2

However, the bridge protocol that you use utilizes it’s own set of external verifiers. While this may not initially seem like a big deal, your funds are now no longer secured by Ethereum, but instead by the verifiers of the bridge:

* If this is a lock/mint bridge, creating wrapped assets, then the bridge verifiers can now unilaterally collude to steal all of your funds.
* If this is a bridge that uses liquidity pools, the bridge verifiers can similarly collude to steal all of the pool capital from LPs.

Despite having waited years for secure, trustless L2s, your situation is now the same as if you had used a trusted sidechain or L1 construction. 

The key takeaway is that cryptoeconomic systems are only as secure as their weakest link. When you use insecure bridges, it doesn’t matter how secure your chain or L2 is anymore. And, similar to the security of L1s and L2s, it all comes entirely down to one question: who is verifying the system?

## The Interoperability Trilemma

Now we get to the thesis of this article, and the mental model that should drive user and developer decisions around bridge selection.

https://preview.redd.it/x1lmxsqntj691.png?width=895&format=png&auto=webp&s=ebc222cd6dbc2692d66f8f1acf8bf09bc3f2bc26

Similar to the Scalability Trilemma, there exists an Interoperability Trilemma in the Ethereum ecosystem. Interop protocols can only have two of the following three properties:

* **Trustlessness:** having equivalent security to the underlying domains.
* **Extensibility:** able to be supported on any domain.
* **Generalizeability:** capable of handling arbitrary cross-domain data.

# How Do Connext and NXTP Fit Into This?

There’s no easy way for us to get all three desireable interoperability properties. We’ve realized, however, that we can take the same approach to solving the Interoperability Trilemma that Ethereum does to solving the Scalability Trilemma.

Ethereum L1 optimizes for security and decentralization at the cost of scalability. The rationale behind this is that these properties are likely the most important for the longevity and utility of a blockchain. Ethereum then adds scalability via L2/sharding as a layer on top of an existing secure and decentralized backbone.

At Connext, we strongly believe that the interoperability system with the most longevity, utility, and adoptability in the Ethereum ecosystem will be one that is maximally trustless and extensible. For this reason, NXTP is a locally verified system specifically designed to be as secure as the underlying domains while still being usable on any domain.

So what about generalizeability? Similar to scalability in the Ethereum ecosystem, we can add generalizeability by plugging in natively verified protocols on top of NXTP (as a “Layer 2” of our interop network!). That way, users and developers get a consistent interface across any domain, and can “upgrade” their connection to be generalized in cases where that functionality is available.

https://preview.redd.it/pxa92hqqtj691.png?width=772&format=png&auto=webp&s=8dbf291042c3d072bba827cdbad0f67558d43c8d

 This is why we say NXTP is the **base protocol** of our interoperability network. The full network will be made of up of a **stack** of protocols which will include NXTP, generalized crosschain bridges specific to a pair of domains, and protocols to connect them all together into one seamless system.

With the Cardano community we have also tried to stay focused around these concepts but as we get many new players sometimes we have this looming.

I thought Getting into Web3 would be a piece of Cake,"I was always fascinated by Blockchain Tech and seeing the innovation and advancement of this sector in past couple of years really motivated me to become part of this space. Since I knew basic HTML, CSS and Javascript I decided to get into this space as a developer.

Now the fun part begins! I started taking tutorials and watched videos online and learned to write simple smart contracts in solidity. I was so arrogant that I thought i would break into this space with the skill of writing a simple smart contract so i started applying like crazy (Without any portfolio to show for). I didn't get any single interview. I realized that I had to up my skill. 

After that i learned a little bit more I created 2 simple projects without frontend: A lottery Smart contract and a ToDo Smart contract and uploaded it to my recently made github profile. I remember I was so confident of getting a job after creating those 2 simple projects. I applied again like crazy and same result ! No interview.

I then decided to up my frontend skill.  I started learning React from Scrimba. After becoming comfortable creating simple frontends with react I decided to connect my smart contract projects to my frontends. Now I had 2 fully functional DApps to show for. I thought I had basic skill in Solidity, Hardhat, ethers.js and React and now I was fully confident that company would hire me for a junior developer role or for an internship. I applied, I applied and I applied but with the same result, No Interview calls! 

I now realize that even for junior roles the skill required to get into this space is much higher than what i initially thought. And now i am in a dilemma to whether continue my learning or to quit my ambition of getting hired in the space. Because even when the market was booming i didn't get a single interview and now when the market is down even the best of the best are getting unemployed. 

Currently my view of getting a job in web3 space has completely changed. At the beginning I thought it would be a piece of cake and now I think i couldn't be any further from getting a job in web3.

I would appreciate If anyone here could suggest me looking at my current skill level as mentioned above weather i have chance breaking into this space (internship or junior dev roles) with another few months of learning (what should i learn further to up my skill?) or should I leave hope getting into this space altogether.

Will Optimism have a future now that Ethereum’s roadmap is ZK centric?,"I’m not saying Optimism and optimistic tech, in general, will cease to exist, I’m just wondering how much will they be relevant the more Ethereum dives deeper into the roadmap.

Vitalik clearly stated on multiple occasions that Ethereum will be ZK-centric meaning any scaling solution that is focused solely on optimistic tech (i.e Optimism) will most likely lose a lot of daily active users.

It is even apparent by how scaling solutions are starting to focus way more on ZK tech.  
Loopring, Zksync, and Starkware are all known for ZK scaling solutions.

Polygon is also a perfect example. It has both optimistic and ZK-based scaling solutions but has recently started favoring ZK tech more and is allocating way more funds towards ZK rather than optimistic. Its to the point where they literally allocated a billion dollars just for that and already have more than 4 ZK-based scaling solutions.

I doubt that Optimism and optimistic tech will become irrelevant cause they will always be needed, however, I think influence will definitely start decreasing slowly but surely with time.

Also the most recent does not help at all (even though it is completely unrelated to the technology and more towards the security)",32.0,2022-06-13 01:37:35,0.88

stETH/ETH questions. Long winded but need to make sure my facts are straight.,"I’m not super familiar with Lido or stETH, but I’m familiar with liquid staking itself.

If so, I am a patient man, and will happily due such. However, what are the risks of Lido going under do to this depeg? Seems like as long as Lido has the 1:1 ratio, then there is nothing to worry about other than the price of stETH depegging, and eventually regaining said peg, once the masses cash out their stETH for ETH. I have to be missing something right? Celsius may go under, but that’s nothing fundamental to stETH (as a network asset, just price) nor fundamental to ETH, that’s simply Celsius (and probably many more entities) over leveraging.

Potential crisis looming at Celsius," (From Peter Huang)  


This $3 billion crypto company was teasing that it might be valued at $10 billion this year.  


Is it headed for a huge crisis instead?  


First, some definitions:  


1. Celsius: An app where lots of people put their crypto to earn rewards  
2. Staking: Locking up some of your tokens (e.g., ETH) to help the blockchain (e.g., Ethereum) operate  
3. Liquid staking: Some party gives you another token in exchange for your staking. This token is meant to be a claim on the staked token: at some point, you can swap the liquid staking token back for your original. This lets you spend and do stuff with your staked tokens even while they're locked up.  


Users have deposited something like $3.8 billion into Celsius. We're now sort of afraid that Celsius might run into trouble.  


Celsius holds \~1 million ETH in the bank - that's \~$1.6-1.8 billion depending on the day. The problem is that only 27% is in actual ETH.  


The rest is locked up in ETH2 staking, which won't unlock for at least a year, or is stored as stETH, which is a liquid staking token.  


Remember: stETH is not ETH itself - rather, you'll be able to convert stETH to ETH whenever ETH2 staking unlocks. But it's unclear when that date is.  


People generally viewed stETH as low-risk - there's only downside if the Ethereum chain implodes entirely or never completes its transition to proof of stake and unlocks the staked tokens. Because of this, stETH has so far been valued as equal to 1 ETH.  


What's the issue? In summary, people are pulling their money out of Celsius. Latest estimate is something like 50K of ETH ($80-90 million) is leaving Celsius every week.  


There's only about 270K of actual ETH. If this continues for another \~5 weeks, Celsius has some tough choices to make.  


Oh, the other problem? Celsius took out $1 billion of loans using customers' ETH/stETH as collateral.  


If push comes to shove, Celsius will have to sell the stETH, which can cause 1 stETH to be worth less than 1 ETH if they sell enough. Depending on how far the price of stETH falls, this could cause their loans to get liquidated.  


(Worth mentioning: there are other big players who hold lots of stETH. If they dump their stETH, that could cause Celsius loans to be in trouble, too.)  


I doubt Celsius will just watch all this happen. They will probably just disable withdrawals when it gets risky. But never good to have big problems looming.  


This is just the latest in ""safe"" tokens being challenged post-UST/LUNA. USDT was under threat as people started to pull money out of crypto.  


Now stETH, which was viewed as generally safe (""It's all tied to securing Ethereum, and Ethereum isn't going away!"") and probably will be just fine given enough time, is starting to drop in price.  


The problem is that players like Celsius are going to get caught in the window when it's not fine at all.

Optimism hacker appears and says he could return the stolen goods.,"The person who stole 20 million units of the optimism (OP) token broke his silence. Hours ago, he sent a transaction to Ethereum co-creator Vitalik Buterin, along with a message in which he assures that he will return much of what he stole.

""Hi Vitalik, I believe in you, I just want to know your opinion on this. By the way, help me verify the sender's address and I'll return the rest,"" the message reads. It adds, ""Hi Wintermute, sorry, I only have 18 million [tokens] and this is what I can return. stay optimistic!"".

Apparently, part of the funds if will stay in various DeFi protocols and other blockchain projects, especially the large part that according to the investigation has been used to invest in Ownex, Minosis Token and LunaFi.

The theft had occurred before the airdrop that benefited users of Ethereum's second layer, Optimism. The attacker took advantage of a vulnerability in the decentralized finance platform (DeFi) Wintermute to take the tokens, valued at nearly USD 17 million.

The fact that the event had been kept secret for several days caused unease among many users of this scalability solution, as they considered it a lack of transparency on the part of the organization.

Now, with the promise to return a large part of the stolen tokens, the market has reacted. On price tracking portals such as CoinMarketCap it can be seen that OP's price increased slightly in the last hours, just when the hacker broke the silence.

Now, we will have to wait if Buterin gives any response to his message and if, indeed, the attacker keeps his promise.",163.0,2022-06-11 09:31:53,0.85

How to attend Ethereum Conferences for Free,"I spent a week in Miami for a multi-chain crypto conference and my flight, hotel and food cost me $0. I even made some money while doing this. The really crazy part? 2 months ago I didn’t even know such a thing was possible.

I recently learned about a thing called crypto scholarships and crypto hackathons and hundreds of people having been using them as a great ways to travel the world for free, meet cool people, build cool stuff, make some money and learn new skills. Today, I will show you how to do the same.

## How I Learned About This

I first learned about this when I went to the Ethereum conference in Amsterdam, [ETHAmsterdam](https://amsterdam.ethglobal.com/), I met a cool group of women from an Organization called  Blu3 DAO.

Me: “Amsterdam is fun but so expensive, I don’t think I don’t know when I can afford this again.”

Them: “O, we don’t pay for trips. We’ve been to Barcelona, Amsterdam, Denver. Flights, hotel, food. Everything paid for.”

I was intrigued.

Someone else told me in passing that they had about a couple days left of cash before they had to head back home but they were planning on winning 1 or 2 hackathon prizes so they could stay in Europe longer.

I was intrigued again.

Intrigued by all these things I was hearing, I decided to delve deeper and do some research, here’s my guide to how to travel the world for free with crypto scholarships.

## How it Works

So what’s the catch? Even as I’m writing this, It’s pretty incredible that these things even exist. You literally travel the world for free, go to cool events and parties, do some work and get paid. The reason this exists (the catch) is that a lot of crypto companies, blockchains, tools need to grow and they have money to spend. So a common growth strategy is offering scholarships for people who use their platforms. You also don’t need to code to qualify, as I’ll explain later.

## Join Crypto and Web3 Communities

The best way to start finding these opportunities is by being aware of the different communities that exist in the crypto and web3 space.

## Get Twitter, Discord and Telegram accounts

Most of these communities exist virtually on Twitter, Discord and Telegram. So in order to get involved and be aware of what’s out there, you’ll need to make an account on those 3 platforms.

Crypto is a fast-moving space and most of the information is shared on Twitter and semi-public channels on Discord and Telegram so if you want to be aware of those opportunities you need to be plugged into those channels.

1. Twitter
2. Discord
3. Telegram

## Join a DAO

Next, find a bunch of  [DAOs](https://ethereum.org/en/dao/)  and join them. A DAO is basically just a fancy word for a club or a group of people that are connected in some way.

Here’s a list of DAOs you can join to start your search.

1. [Developer DAO](https://twitter.com/developer_dao)
2. [PadawanDAO](https://twitter.com/padawandao)
3. [Blu3 DAO](https://twitter.com/blu3dao)
4. [Atilatech](https://twitter.com/atilatech?lang=en)
5. [Her DAO](https://twitter.com/_herdao?lang=en)
6. [BoysClub](https://mobile.twitter.com/boysclubcrypto)
7. [Women Build Web3](https://twitter.com/womenbuildweb3)
8. [Women in Web3](https://twitter.com/womeninweb3)
9. [BanklessDAO](https://twitter.com/banklessdao?lang=en)

From my research, most of the scholarship and grant opportuntiies are focused on getting more women and non-binary folx into web3. This is great news because if you’re woman or non-binary person reading this, it means there’s lots of scholarships available for you. It also means that tese events are not all “crypto bros”.

Also, even if you’re a man you can still get some of these grants. For example, one of the scholarships I received was by a women and non-binary group and marketed mostly toawards women, however, they reserved 10% of the total scholarship pools for men to join as allies. Many people might have missed that fine print but you should always look carefully at the fine print. I think many of the other women-focused DAOs do the same.

## Follow the DAO’s Socials

First, thing you should do is follow the DAO on Twitter, then follow their Discord and Telegram pages. Different DAOs have different messaging norms. Most accounts have a Twitter presence, but will post the real-time information on Discord or Telegram.

There’s a lot of information asymmetry in web3, let me explain:

Remember that meme about how Twitter gets all the jokes first and then people on Instagram find out about it? Well usually some news will be shared on Discord or Telegram first (“alpha” in crypto twitter Lingo), then it will get to Twitter and sometimes depending on the nature of the information, by the time it gets to Twitter, it’s already too late.

You might find that even more information is being shared in an invite-only chat on Telegram and all you have to do to join is ask!. This is just like school study groups. There’s usually a group chat where a lot of useful information is being shared so make sure you ask around so you can find it and join.

## Follow People in Web3

In addition to following organizations you should also follow individuals since they’ll post a lot of information as well that span across different organizations. I recommend the following accounts:

1. [Mabel.Tech](https://twitter.com/mabelochebiri)
2. [GigaHierz](https://mobile.twitter.com/gigahierz)
3. [Steph (Oceans 404)](https://twitter.com/0ceans404)
4. [Novell](https://twitter.com/novellsk8)
5. [Dabit3](https://twitter.com/dabit3)
6. [Maia Zennie](https://twitter.com/maiazennie)
7. [Daphne](https://twitter.com/daphachar)
8. [Seemcat](https://twitter.com/seemcat)

## Find Scholarships

Once you’ve joined or followed these DAOs you can start looking for scholarships.

1. Social Media Search (Twitter, Telegram, Discord)
2. Atlas Search
3. Asking organizations to create scholarships
4. Google Search

## Social Media Search

Most of the information about scholarships are on social media websites and semi-public channels like Telegram and Discord, but it can be very hard to keep up with the large amounts of volume generated by these platforms. So a very underrated tool is just using the search features.

For Twitter search you can usually search for “\[event\_you\_want\_to\_attend\] scholarship” or “\[dao\_name\]” scholarship. Here are some examples:

* “[Blu3DAO scholarship](https://twitter.com/search?q=blu3dao%20scholarship&src=typed_query&f=top)”
* “[ETHCC Grants](https://twitter.com/search?q=EthCC%20%20grants&src=typed_query&f=top)”

For Discord and Telegram, go to each DAO that you’ve joined and just search for the word scholarship or grant.

&#x200B;

## Atlas Search

Another method is using a dedicated crypto search engine like  [Atlas](https://atlas.atila.ca/)  ([broswer extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/atila-atlas/lhjdnmdnomdgjkbefpnehflckklipbak)). If you search Atlas for the word, “scholarship” or “grants” all the crypto and web3 pages that are related to scholarships will be available.  


Note: I made Atlas and Atila

## Asking organizations to create scholarships

A very underrated way of finding scholarships, which  [I’ve recommended before](https://atila.ca/blog/tomiwa/atila-scholarship-guide#bonus-asking-for-scholarships-that-dont-exist)  is straight up asking people to create scholarships or grants programs. Suppose you want to attend ETHCC and you see a bunch of organizations are attending but not offering scholarships, you can just ask them to create one and give a compelling reason for what they could gain from doing a scholarship.

You can  [use this template when emailing or DMing organizations to start a scholarship ir grant](https://atila.ca/blog/tomiwa/atila-scholarship-guide#sample-email-or-phone-script).

&#x200B;

## Google Search

Sometimes things are so obvious you overlook them. A great example of this is using Google to find crypto scholarships. A simple Google search for words like “[crypto hackathon scholarships](https://www.google.com/search?q=crypto+hackathon+scholarships)” or “[crypto ecosystem grants](https://www.google.com/search?q=crypto+ecosystem+grants)” can deliver some great results.

Google is  [not](https://future.a16z.com/the-future-of-search-is-boutique/)  [very](https://medium.com/bankless-dao/how-web3-writers-do-research-719cb9857eb#:~:text=Google%20doesn%E2%80%99t%20like%20our%20Web3%20content%20(yet)%2C%20but%20sometimes%20it%20pulls%20right%20up.)

For example, many grants and scholarships are in Google Forms, Typeform or Notion. Pages won’t show up on a Google Search, so for those you will likely need to use a tool like  [Atlas](https://atlas.atila.ca/)  to find them.

## Apply for Scholarship

Once you’ve actually found some scholarships and grants, you’ll need to write an application. I wrote a  [guide on how to write a good scholarship or grant application](https://atila.ca/blog/tomiwa/atila-scholarship-application-guide/). Here are some more tips that are specific to scholarships for crypto-related events:

## Writing a Good Application

When you’re applying for a scholarship they generally want to see that you can contribute to their ecosystem. This can be reflected in a variet of ways.

1. Coding experience to build cools apps on their platform
2. Social media following to prompt their platform
3. Previous example of taking initiative

While 1 and 2 may require you to know how to code or have a large following on social media. Which not everyone might have. Literally, anyone can qualify for number 3. All it means is that you need to have some way to prove that if you were given the scholarship, you can give value back to the people providing the scholarship.

I asked Daphne, “what do you look for in a scholarship applicant”, she gave great answer.

Summary:

* Priority for software developers (you don’t need web3/crypto experience!)
   * but also open to people from a wide range of backgrounds (artists, lawyers, teachers etc.)
* They prioritize inclusivity so they try to get people from a wide range of backgrounds
* Effort in your answers. They look at how much thought and effort you put into the long answer questions

## Engaging on Social Media

By now it should be clear to you how important social media is in the crypto and web3 space. Another, great way to stand out to the scholarship and grant reviewers is by engaging with them on social media. For example, see  [what my friend Maia did to get a ticket to ETHCC in Paris](https://twitter.com/maiazennie/status/1531092690330193922).

## Fulfilling the Scholarship Requirements

In the spirit of transparency, I actually got one of my scholarships taken away because they felt like I didn’t fulfill the scholarship requirements. Learn from my experience, know that this is a thing that can be happen and make sure you’re very clear on what the expectations of the scholarship are.

## Many Grants are Reimbursed but Arrangments Can be Made

Some of these scholarships require yu to buy the ticket first and then they pay you back. This helps situations which have happened to many DAOs where people take the money and don’t show up. Depending on your financial situation, this might not be feasible for you to pay even if you’re going to get reimbursed. I’d encourage you to message them and they can usually work something out.

## Crypto Hackathons

The other thing you should do is apply for crypto hackathons. In addition to getting your trip paid for, you can also often get paid thousands of dollars for building a crypto-related project in a weekend. You also don’t need to know how to code to apply. As long as you can add value in another way (project management, slides, presentation, design etc.) find someone who can code and join their team. Also, at some hackathons you may not even need to code, I’ve been at a hackathon where one of the winners presented a Figma template. It’s pretty remarkable that for a lot of these hackathons you can do anywhere from 6-36 hours worth of work and win around $2-5,000.

Here’s a list of websites that offer hackathons:

1. [Devpost](https://devpost.com/hackathons)
2. [MLH.io](https://mlh.io/)
3. [DoraHacks](https://dorahacks.io/)
4. [Crypto Events 2022 \[by CNC\]](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1KtyFTb_W282bQ1xoVA5rlTwTDz3QfhswWIVpXhpbQIc/edit)
5. [EthGlobal](https://ethglobal.com/)
   1. [In my experience](https://atila.ca/blog/tomiwa/ethamsterdam-2022-notes-building-the-future-with-crypto/#ethglobal-knows-how-to-run-a-good-event), ETHGlobal, consistently has the best hackathons. So if you can’t make it to all of these, try to make it to at least the ETHGlobal events.

## Thank You

I want to thank the following organizations for paying for my trip expenses, giving me hackathon prizes and creating this amazing opportunity for thousands of people all over the world to discover web3.

* [EthGlobal](https://ethglobal.com/)
* [Blu3DAO](https://linktr.ee/Blu3_dao)

## Conclusion

Crypto scholarships and hackathons are a great way to travel the world, meet cool people, make some money and learn something new. It’s pretty amazing that such opportunities like this exist and many people don’t know about it. So now that you know about it, make the most of it.",147.0,2022-06-10 10:57:53,0.85
ENS domains - What I have learned so far and projection of the possible future," Ethereum will probably be the 1. most used crypto in the future because it has a broad application, currently, about 4 million people use it but I see that number rising exponentially in coming years with crypto integration so hundreds of millions of people could potentially start to use it. 

Using a long 0x.... address will be complicated so everybody would probably want to buy ENS for themselves to simplify the transactions and to brand it because it is cool. There are only 2889 combinations of 3 number ENS and about 3276 3 letters combination in the English alphabet. I think they are really underpriced right now and there would be at least 6000 multimillionaires who would like to flex and to have them so their price might be hundred of thousands if not millions of dollars soon.  Anthony Hopkins just today bought an ENS and I think we will see that more and more in the following months.

There is also the real possibility of all Web3 things being linked to your .eth, so your wallet address, e-mail, website, maybe even real-life ownership of the real estate and such, lot of possibilities.

So buying the .eth ENS now will put you in a great place when that happens. Everybody will want to buy a personal .eth and by almost all meaningful being bought they will need to buy it from people who own them. I suggest everybody buy at least 10-20 which have a meaning and hold until that happens. That will be a 10-100x investment in 1-2 years easily.

There are a lot of great ones that have a good meaning and are not yet bought, you just need to be a bit creative. Also, there are a lot of companies and influential and wealthy people whose real names have not been bought yet.

A good tool to use when doing research is ens tools and ens vision. For you to buy your first domain you just go to ens dot domains and check if it is free. If yes you connect your metamask wallet and buy it, when gas is low 5+ letters can be bought for \~18$. It is automatically listed under your profile on opensea and you can list it for sale or connect it with your wallet address so people can use your newly bought ENS for sending you ETH.  
 

These are some of the domains I have bought, maybe they can give you some inspiration for your future purchases.

The ApeCoin DAO proposal officially leans towards keeping the community within the Ethereum network.,"ApeCoin DAO, a governance system serving the democratic rights of holders of ApeCoin - a digital asset linked to the Bored Ape Yacht Club collection ecosystem - released an official proposal on May 2 to discuss whether the asset should remain on the Ethereum network, transition to a Layer 2 alternative or perhaps explore the possibility of switching chains.

The ApeCoin Improvement Proposal (AIP) titled ""AIP-41: Keep ApeCoin within the Ethereum Ecosystem,"" was drafted by BAYC 2491, known as ASEC, and was inspired by a number of incidents, including Otherdeed's controversial minting of NFTs, and the subsequent backlash from Yuga Labs.

For the counter proposal inspired by previous incidents, controversies and more recent decentralization or DeFi projects such as Ownex, Minosis Token or LunaFi, was put on the table as a possible solution.

However, After a six-day voting period, the final results convincingly reveal that 67.77% of ApeCoin users advocate staying on Ethereum for the medium-term future, with 4 million APE tokens used in votes.

The calamitous auction of Yuga Labs' Otherdeeds metaverse lands intensely scrutinized the financial limitations of Ethereum's gas-rate mechanics, and led key members of the ApeCoin community to voice their concerns around ApeCoin's fixed supply contract, and its potential for scalability.

The overwhelming deflation of the gas wars, and the lack of financial inclusion or integrity, was then compounded by Yuga Labs' ill-timed tweet insisting that ""it seems pretty clear that ApeCoin will need to migrate to its own blockchain in order to scale properly,"" and that ""we would encourage the DAO to start thinking in this direction.""

Despite Yuga Labs' not at all subtle suggestion, AIP-41 passionately advocated against Ethereum migration, stating that ""such a decision is currently too complex and costly to make,"" and could potentially damage its entrenched network presence with the highest volume and cultural adoption of NFT.

The outcome of the vote on the ApeCoin DAO proposal will not be final and may be deliberated and rebutted with a secondary vote within a three-month grace period.

The total vote on the proposal was 2.7 million in favor and 1.3 million against, which is 67.77%. This result is not entirely final, and may be further deliberated with the submission of new proposals within the aforementioned three-month grace period.",96.0,2022-06-09 16:24:09,0.94

OpenSea Ethereum Transaction Volume Decreased by 25%: Could There Be A Less Interest In NFTs Already?,"Since August of last year, OpenSea has been routinely producing billions of dollars’ worth of transaction volume each month, making it the most successful marketplace in the whole NFT industry ahead of BinanceNFT, SolSea and new marketplaces like LooksRare and Solis. 

 However, the transaction volume of OpenSea based on Ethereum in May was $2.596 billion, which is a decline of roughly 25% from April’s value, and the number of monthly active users was 422,300, which is a drop of around 11% from April’s flow rate.  According to Dune, OpenSea clasped a decreasing trend in transaction volume by recording a 40% percent month-over-month rise in trading volume in April. During the same month, approximately $3.5 billion worth of Ethereum NFT deals were completed.  

The non-fungible token market as a whole is moving away from the way in which it was historically controlled by Ethereum. Traders are now more equally distributed across many alternative-chain markets, and the average number of user transactions is growing while costs are decreasing.  In addition, the data from DappRadar reveals that Magic Eden has executed NFT transactions at a far greater pace than OpenSea. Despite this, the marketplace situated in Solana has reported lower sales metrics owing to the scarcity of blue-chip NFTs.  What move could help revive the downtrend?",127.0,2022-06-06 20:46:37,0.9
How do Layer 2 chains pay for gas with Ether?,"Layer 2 chains have their own native tokens, right, but when rolling up transactions to layer one, the gas fees still need to be paid in Ether.

Ethereum gave birth to multi-purpose chains meaning the vast majority of crypto projects owe homage to Ethereum,"Technically speaking, Bitcoin started it all. But the innovation in smart contracts and dApps all started with Ethereum.

All your favorite platforms, dApps, and NFT games owe homage to Ethereum.  
Without Ethereum, most of the market would simply have blockchains like Bitcoin designed around one application that has the sole purpose of keeping track of digital money.

All chains that are competing against Ethereum right now got inspired by Ethereum in the first place. In fact, some of the most popular competitors have either founders or developers that were once building on Ethereum and decided to branch out and do their own thing.

And yeah Ethereum isn’t without its flaws. It is notorious for its high gas fees and overall scalability issues. But this is slowly becoming less and less of a problem seeing how fast scaling solutions have been developing new tech, especially in the ZK space with projects like Loopring and Zksync.  
Polygon alone allocated a billion dollars solely for ZK tech development and currently has 4 ZK scaling solutions.

So in brief, if you have a crypto project that you love religiously, 99% of the time it is a project forked from, built on top of, or inspired by Ethereum. Never forget that.",57.0,2022-06-03 15:29:14,0.79
I love seeing Optimism doing its thing. But I think ZK tech will eventually win over Optimistic tech,"And when I say “ZK tech will win” this doesn’t mean that Optimistic tech will disappear completely.  
Optimistic tech will always be needed for specific situations and it will always have users that prefer it.

What I mean by this is that Ethereum will end up being ZK centric for a multitude of reasons. Vitalik himself said this once on the Bankless podcast.

ZK is simply faster and cheaper than optimistic tech and most importantly, its a lot more private which is an added benefit for a blockchain known for its decentralization.

If anything, you can already start seeing tell tale signs of how the ecosystem is shifting towards ZK centric L2s just by looking at the funds being granted for development.  
ZK based L2s have been getting A LOT more funding than optimistic based L2s plus they’re getting more partnerships as well.  
Loopring’s famous partnership with GameStop is one example you’d think of instantly.  
Another example would be ETH giants like BitDAO granting Zksync $200 million for the development of ZkDAO (apparently a scaling solution solely for DAOs).  
And this is not to mention the tons of funds getting poured into ZK tech all over the Ethereum ecosystem.

Now compare these numbers and data with the ones being allocated for optimistic based L2s and you’ll know exactly what I mean.  
Ethereum is slowly but surely heading towards ZK integration. That is a fact.",89.0,2022-06-03 15:17:52,0.93
Are GPUs becoming more affordable due to Ethereum's upcoming merge?,"GPUs or Graphics Processing Units, which are mainly used to mine ethereum, are becoming less expensive. This is possible because the network plans to convert from a proof-of-work or PoW model to a proof-of-stake or PoS one.

 And rendering these computer parts completely worthless for all those mining ethereum.


Leveraging information from Tom's Hardware, CoinDesk found that the valuation for top GPU units on eBay had plummeted by 37 percent since May 2021, when Chinese officials announced a further ban on cryptocurrency mining in the nation.


However, the price decline has increased this year. Ethereum developers explore the PoS approach and the value of the second-largest cryptocurrency plummets.


On the online platform, the value of ten key GPU models fell by 7.4 percent in January, 9.5 percent in February, and 12 percent in March. According to Tristan Gerra, executive director and lead analyst for semiconductors at investment group Robert W. Baird, cryptocurrency mining accounts for around 35 percent of worldwide customer needs for GPUs. GPU miners ""are not truly investing in new hardware at the present time, since valuations have been significant for a while."" This was basically said by Joe Downie, chief marketing manager at hash power broker NiceHash. Instead, ""most of them are probably trying for when Ethereum shifts to PoS, to snap up the secondhand GPUs"" from people who will actually give up when the switch happens. Currently ETH moves closer to its new ecosystem, many Web 3.0 projects like Polygon, faith tribe, Tron and Theta will benefit as the web 3.0 ecosystem as whole will become more cost efficient. 


According to Haohao, a marketing representative from Xuxin Science and Technology, a firm that resells mining rigs in China, the situation in Ukraine reduced cryptocurrency prices in February. This condition makes mine less viable, and so GPU values fell even further.

You could loose all your crypto in 1 click. Major vulnerability for Windows users.,"Heads up to anyone using Windows.

A   critical vulnerability has been discovered in Windows and more   specifically Word (which is installed by default). Until this is patched   you could be exposing ALL your computer's data to attackers without   even opening the document. This is not even a complicated exploits so   you can be sure that there is going to be a wave of infected documents   circulating in the coming days.

It is recommended that you disable the vulnerable service for the time being, as described in this thread: [https://twitter.com/wallet\_guard/status/1531848479911432192?s=20&t=RvmCQ4qOiuwj-9MIyt9fXw](https://twitter.com/wallet_guard/status/1531848479911432192?s=20&t=RvmCQ4qOiuwj-9MIyt9fXw)

This   is very very serious guys. One infected Word doc and you could be   opening the door to keyloggers, tracking malware, spyware, file   extraction, everything.

EDIT:  A lot of people seem to point out that Word is NOT installed by default on all machines so not everyone would be vulnerable but if you do have it, or don't know, just be careful.",121.0,2022-06-01 13:29:36,0.71
I feel like Ethereum’s scalability issue is becoming less and less relevant with the fast development of L2s,"I might be biased cause I’ve been part of the Ethereum community since 2018, but I genuinely think that Ethereum is the best chain out there right now. However, the only issue with it has always been traffic and gas fees.

Ethereum has always been plagued with this issue but I’m starting to feel like it's slowly but surely becoming less and less of a problem with how fast L2s have been developing their tech.

Ethereum is taking a rollup-centric roadmap right now (specifically ZK rollups) and it will eventually integrate L2s into the blockchain in a way that makes them nearly inseparable from Ethereum. Vitalik talked a lot about it and he basically dreams of an Etherum where L2s aren't considered as an add-on anymore but more of a part of Ethereum that will end up being taken for granted with no second thought about them. We’re already seeing a ton of exciting Zk development from multiple projects on the market most notably Polygon which I think takes the cake with 4 ZK scaling solutions ready for use (Hermez, Miden, Zero, and Nightfall) and $1 billion allocated for ZK tech development.

All of this effort and funds combined will end up making Ethereum problem less and less relevant, especially after the introduction of sharding which will basically put L2s on steroids.",507.0,2022-05-31 09:53:11,0.91

**Frequently Asked Questions**

**Where's the best place to buy ETH?**

There are many centralized exchanges that support Ethereum. If you live in the US, the most popular exchanges are Coinbase, Gemeni and Kraken. Coinbase users can use Coinbase Pro for lower fees.

**When is Eth2 launching?**

Eth2 is a marketing term used to represent a number of updates to Ethereum. The Eth2 proof-of-stake chain first launched in December 2020. ""The Merge"", which is the event that will fully switch Ethereum's consensus to proof-of-stake, is estimated to be ready in early 2022, although there is no exact timeline. Other updates, such as data shards, will follow that update.

Visit [ethmerge.com](https://ethmerge.com/) to learn more about ""The Merge"".

**Do I need to do anything to update to Eth2? Will Eth2 create a new token?**

No, ETH holders *never* need to take any action to keep holding ETH. Ethereum users will be unaffected by the Eth2 upgrade. And the Eth2 updates will not create any new tokens.

**How can I stake my ETH?**

The best way to stake your ETH: by running your own validator.

* Running your own validator requires a modern computer and 32 ETH. Visit /r/ethstaker for more details

**Why are Ethereum transaction fees so high?**

Like most blockchains, Ethereum fees are determined by supply-and-demand. The large demand to use Ethereum has pushed transaction fees quite high (however, fees were just a few cents only 2 years ago). Fees are especially high during market volatility, and during NFT drops.

**What is being done to lower Ethereum transaction fees?**

Ethereum fees are reduced by using layer-2 rollups. Rollups are scaling solutions that allow for significantly cheaper transactions, while still maintaining Ethereum's security.

Additionally, Eth2's data shards will make rollups even cheaper.

While rollups are cutting-edge technology being actively developed, a number are already live on Ethereum mainnet. Visit [l2beat.com](https://l2beat.com/) to learn more about rollups.

**What's the best wallet for Ethereum?**

The most popular tool for using decentralized applications is Metamask. However, for security reasons, we recommend using a hardware wallet such as a Trezor or Ledger.

To the guy in the top post about the Polygon bridge. It is completely 100% safe you just gotta check the mainnet,"# I'm well aware that he had his problem fixed but some people (especially newcomers) read titles and instantly believe them.

Someone in the top post is warning everyone in all caps about Polygon’s bridge but in reality, he’s just looking in the wrong place.

The Polygon/Ethereum bridge is completely safe. Yeah, agreed. I don’t know if you’ve used this bridge before you but what basically happens is that the ETH HAS to be burned on Polygon before it gets released and you’re capable of withdrawing it on the mainnet.

You basically just panicked over nothing pal. Next time all you have to do is go to [bridge-explorer.polygon.technology](https://bridge-explorer.polygon.technology) and just press the confirm exit button. It's that simple.

"DeFi is either truly immutable or permissionless, or it is only ""automated finance"".","The TLDR is that behind the scenes the US and EU want global mandatory travel rule, which means KYC, compliance, on every DeFi smart contract, every software wallet, and eventually trezor and nano. This is their starting point, because they basically run the world and want a ""suprastate"" more or less.

They're just going to legally intimidate, enforce, coerce, extradite, prosecute etc developers until they bleed us dry and fully intimidate any venture capital. VC can't do anything, all major liquidity providers will always be extremely legally exposed.

We need to look at a few facts here:

1) Web 3 helps people in failed states more than developed nations. If a government is particularly terrible and undemocratic, Web 3 being fully immutable and fully anonymous is an absolute necessity.

2) Canada proved that allegedly democratic states will fascistically confiscate funds and politically persecute you for speech and assembly. 

3) america has done this in the past, to countless people, notably the Internment of Japanese citizens. america has reneged on countless treaties.

4) Most developing nations are in fact colonially designed ""Post-Colonial administrative States"" that are designed to largely enrich international companies at the expense of civil liberties for the developing world. 

5) ""activist"" regularly collude with and weaponize the Privitization of Multinational capital institutions to advocate censorship and confiscation of funds, deplatforming of rights to a living, ""activist"" regularly collude with executive branches of states simultaneously to do extrajudicial, unelected confiscatory and censorial behavior against their political enemies

5b) this sets the precedent to do the same behavior to other outgroups in developing nations, it serves as a playbook for what undemocratic countries can do, and furthers the extreme fascistic behavior of Web2 companies, who also operate overseas in developing nations. It's also already happened in numerous egregious instances I won't get into.

6) Banks and Web2 were used extensively from 2001-to late 2017 and current to further the war on terror, the continued prejudice exists to this day with Persians being blackballed from most of the entire crypto industry, even blackballed from Github.

7) China's entire political system is utterly anti-thetical to crypto, the CCP largely has no use for blockchain technology. The type of human control they want is much easier with SQL databases.

7b) China locked people in their apartments for 60 days, so yes you basically belong to the state there, good luck with speech or finance. 

8) People in extremely poor developing nations have absolutely no documentation or their documentation is extremely limited, banking is non existent. If they are given permissioned back doored narc ware automated crypto-finance, their own government will use it to prejudice them deeply, and that's not even getting into what we already do to say Iran as I already mentioned.

9) Web 1 is not state resistant. Self hosting is not state or sovereign resistant. Tor is not enough. Web 1 is not ""neutral territory"",  in that individual websites can easily be targeted, you do not have a ""platform network commons of neutrality"" to give some sort of ""lost in the crowd effect"" to protect you from political persecution. 

9b) Though the absolute blockchainifcation of everything is stupid, and excess tokens are stupid, Web 1 basically has no state resistance to corrupt or ideological factions of the state, or states, without some finality, fidelity, and encryption via Zkrollups and layer 3 features and or Lightning, or IBC, etc. offchain engineering without onchain guarantees makes web 1 deeply vulnerable and deeply unscalable. This is why Web2 beat Web 1's network effect so severely, scale and adoption based on peer to peer usage.  

10) Currency Boards, Central Banks, and Lebanon as example. Need I say more.

11) and this is important, Daos that we have, have made, or have tried to make are by definition much more democratic and transparent than Western Governments. Whatever international consensus you think is needed to public infrastructure, taxation, charity, children, the elderly, whatever concern you have about oversight of ""criminals"", public networks like ethereum, and public protocols like aave are infinitely more democratic than the US government, SEC, or countless evil web 2 companies like Reddit.",28.0,2022-05-28 17:09:52,0.77

L2s are a great medicine for scalability but they aren’t the cure,"Now I have to clarify that Vitalik’s vision is for L2s to become so incredibly efficient that the difference between medicine and cure doesn’t even matter anymore. He wants L2s to basically become an integral part of Ethereum’s chain.

But for the meantime, my title stays true to its word. L2s are more of a very effective band aid that constantly need change from time to time.

And that’s okay as long as L2s keep up this current pace of development.  
Some find it toxic, but I think the rivalry between L2s is exactly what’s keeping Ethereum alive right now cause each L2 is trying to 1up the other.  
Polygon and Loopring are both at each other’s neck and have both come up with some great tech as a result of that. We’ve also saw some aggressive development from Zksync resulting in impressive scalability number which landed them lots of funds from bitdao for ZkDAO’s development.

This is exactly what Vitalik is dreaming of, L2s grinding so hard that eventually they get so good at what they do that it all becomes seamless and part of the process where people think of L2s as part of Ethereum and basically take them for granted as a normal product not independent from Ethereum anymore.",68.0,2022-05-27 21:32:22,0.75

Ethereum Beacon Chain experiences 7 block reorg: What’s going on?,"""This reorg is not an indicator of a flawed fork choice, but a non-trivial segmentation of updated vs out of date client software,"" said Preston Van Loon, a Core Ethereum developer.

On Wednesday, Ethereum's Beacon Chain underwent a seven-block reorganization, or reorg, ahead of the Merge, which is tentatively scheduled for August. 

According to Beacon Scan data, seven blocks from 3,887,075 to 3,887,081 were removed from the Beacon Chain on Wednesday between 08:55:23 and 08:56:35 am UTC. Ethereum is a transaction network similar to Tron and Concordium which is much faster than the Solana network.

The term ""reorg"" refers to an event in which a canonical chain block, such as the Beacon Chain, is knocked off the chain due to a competing block beating it out.

It could be the result of a malicious attack by a resourceful miner or a bug. In such cases, the chain may unintentionally fork or duplicate. 

On this occasion, developers believe that the problem is a result of circumstance rather than a serious flaw such as a security flaw or fundamental flaw, with a ""proposer boost fork"" being highlighted in particular. This is a method of selecting the next block in the blockchain in which specific proposers are given priority.

Core According to Ethereum developer Preston Van Loon, the reorg was caused by a ""non-trivial segmentation"" of new and old client node software and was not necessarily malicious. Vitalik Buterin, co-founder of Ethereum, called the theory a ""good hypothesis."" 
On Wednesday morning, Martin Köppelmann, co-founder of the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)-compatible Gnosis chain, was among the first to highlight the occurrence via Twitter, noting that it ""shows that the current attestation strategy of nodes should be reconsidered to hopefully result in a more stable chain! (proposals already exist)."" 

Van Loon tentatively attributed the reorg to the proposer boost fork, which had not yet been fully implemented, in response to Köppelmann:

“We suspect this is caused by the implementation of Proposer Boost fork choice has not fully rolled out to the network. This reorg is not an indicator of a flawed fork choice, but a non-trivial segmentation of updated vs out of date client software.”

“All of the details will be made public once we have a high degree of confidence regarding the root cause. Expect a post-mortem from the client development community!” he added.

Terence Tsao, another developer, echoed this hypothesis to his 11,900 Twitter followers earlier on Thursday, noting that the reorg appeared to be caused by ""boosted vs. non-boosted nodes in the network and the timing of a really late arriving block:"" 

""Given that the proposer boost is a non-binding change. Because of the asymmetry in the client release schedule, the roll-out occurred gradually. ""Not all nodes updated the proposer boost at the same time.""

Van Loon stated last week at the Permissionless conference that the Merge and switch to proof-of-stake (PoS) could happen in August ""if everything goes as planned."" 

While the reorganization is bound to raise concerns about the potential timeline, Van Loon and the other developers have yet to explain whether it will have any effect at all.",61.0,2022-05-26 19:51:55,0.74

Did the LUNA crash reveal an inherent risk in Proof Of Stake networks?,"Most stories that you will read about the event will focus on the depegging of the mechanism of the algorithmic stablecoin which was tied to the supply and market value of the protocol token. This is interesting, of course, but I don't see too many people discussing the other side effect, the network became so vulnerable to attacks at the consensus level that the Luna Foundation was forced to turn it off. \[[https://twitter.com/terra\_money/status/1524935730308456448](https://twitter.com/terra_money/status/1524935730308456448)\] Because the proof of stake network derived the security guarantees from the (Dollar) cost of staked Luna, its market price devaluation allowed malicious actors to buy Luna for cheap and attack the network at the consensus level. 

I must confess that I was aware of the concerns for the mechanism design of Luna, and knew there was a risk for a death spiral. However, I did not think the risks would play out so spectacularly and meteorically. I also assumed that in normal market conditions, the decisions of the Luna Foundation Guard (LFG) to use BTC as their forex reserve would allow the foundation to counteract the risks. It was a declaration of defeat of the algorithmic stable coin system, but I thought it would generally be able to recover from volatile - and natural market conditions. That is because I did not consider the coordinated malicious attack security vector. The fact that the attackers were able to short the market made it profitable to crash the market price of Luna, made me revisit previous assumptions I've had and am less confident in POS as a concept.

Once the price of Luna crashed the chain became vulnerable for a consensus level attack, which is why it was 'shut down'. This is often overlooked, but I find it to be the most significant revelation about the entire ordeal. To me this seems to indicate there is a systemic risk for a death spiral on EVERY proof of stake network. Yes, even Ethereum, the network that I use daily, and that I chose as the most secure infrastructure to build the platform that I am working on. The core concept of Proof Of Stake is that it is expensive to be a malicious actor. But the expense to attack a proof of stake network is not denominated in value exogenous to the network itself. You stake Ether to secure Ethereum, and thus make the Ether that you need to run computation on that network more valuable. That means that **if the value of Ether goes down, the security of the Ethereum network goes down**. There is a point in which you can effectively use market mechanics to bring the value of Ethtereum low enough to make an attack on the network’s consensus viable, at which point the value of Ether would continue to fall in the same kind of feedback loop that we saw with Luna. Impractical, yes, unrealistic, I don't think so. **The network is valuable because it is expensive to attack it, and it’s expensive to attack it because the unit price of Ether is valuable.** This logic is a bit more circular than I am comfortable with. 

Have people addressed this risk in PoS chains directly? I am not too interested in discussing the LUNA thing further, but rather in the consensus level attack that was leveraged once the price tanked. I'd love to hear the community's thoughts on this.",208.0,2022-05-23 02:56:53,0.7

My friend built this super user-friendly EVM tool for devs to have easier access to web3 data.,"We all know that it is not that easy for web3 developers(especially for front-end) to access and present Web3 data due to the infrastructure design of blockchains.

To resolve this issue, My friend [DIY](https://github.com/DIYgod) single-handedly came up with this human-friendly open-source project [Unidata](https://unidata.app/) a few days ago. We believe this tool will make Web3 data much easier to access and display for developers.

Docs: [https://unidata.app/](https://unidata.app/)

GitHub: [https://github.com/NaturalSelectionLabs/Unidata](https://github.com/NaturalSelectionLabs/Unidata)

Let's take the most commonly used web3 data ETH NFT as an example to elaborate on the issue.

1. The EIP-721 standard ETH NFT used has a very ""flexible"" format. An NFT image may use various fields, such as `image` `image_url` or `animation_url.` Depending on the publisher's preference, it might not even be an image at all; it could be a video, a 3D model, etc. The inconsistent formats cause a lot of problems for its front-end presentation.
2. Getting all the Ethereum NFTs owned by a given address is also problematic. Ethereum's design requires you to read all the transaction records of that address to get all its Ethereum NFTs. This is an impossible task for the front-end, but can be partially solved by the various data indexing services currently available. However, the data returned by these services are in different formats, each having its own advantages and disadvantages, while each supports different chains. So how should we choose which one to use?

To address the first issue, Unidata has designed a series of user-friendly and uniform data specifications, divided into four sections - Profiles, Links, Assets, and Notes, and Ethereum NFTs fall under the Assets specification. With a fixed data format returned by Unidata, the front-end no longer has to do the troublesome work of adapting a confusing data format.

Unidata currently supports Ethereum NFT and Solana NFT as well, and the data specifications for Ethereum NFT and Solana NFT are unified. In addition, Unidata will continue to support more Assets sources, all of which will also have unified specifications.

Once the first issue was solved, the second is easy: Unidata's approach is to unify and aggregate the data returned by the various services into the same format. For example, the OpenSea service supports the mainnet, the Alchemy service supports Polygon, the Moralis service supports BSC, Arbitrum, and fantom, and the POAP service supports POAP NFT for the Gnosis chain. With a single line of code from Unidata, you can use these services to get all the NFTs for mainnet, Polygon, BSC, Arbitrum, fantom, and POAP at the same time. An online demo can be seen [here](https://unidata.app/guide/assets/ethereum-nft/#live-demo).

Unidata currently supports not only Assets, but also Profiles, Links, and Notes sections. All the services and data sources currently supported can be seen in this [documentation](https://unidata.app/guide/#supported-sources).

\- [Assets](https://unidata.app/guide/assets/) currently support Ethereum NFT(mainnet, Polygon, BSC, Arbitrum, Fantom, Gnosis, POAP), Solana NFT, Alchemy, Solscan, Moralis, and OpenSea.

\- [Notes](https://unidata.app/guide/notes/) currently support Mirror Entry, Ethereum NFT Activity(mainnet, Polygon, BSC, Arbitrum, Fantom, Gnosis, POAP), RSS3.

\- [Profiles](https://unidata.app/guide/profiles/) currently support ENS, Crossbell, Infura.

\- [Links](https://unidata.app/guide/links/) currently support CyberConnect.

Many more features are in progress and will be active very soon.

I built a universal NFT virtual machine.,"Hey Reddit, just wanted to share something cool I’ve been working on.

It’s an NFT protocol, but different from the usual NFT contracts you’ve seen. 

Most NFT contracts hardcode their minting logic directly into the contract. What I’ve built (It’s called “Cell”) is not really an “NFT contract”, but an “NFT virtual machine contract”. There is no NFT collection-specific logic built into the contract. The contract acts as an operating system that interprets and executes offchain signed messages called “script” and authorizes whether to mint them into NFTs or not. Which means you can use this offchain scripts to print as many NFTs as you want for free. And it lets you do all that without relying on a 3rd party. If you want to quickly see what it is, I recommend checking out this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVvwy3JuCKo

Another important part of Cell is its “universal tokenId” system. Unlike most NFT collections where the NFT creator arbitrarily assigns tokenIds, the universal tokenId ensures that every single unique NFT will have EXACTLY the same tokenId across space and time, regardless of which blockchain it’s stored on, regardless of which contract it’s stored on, and regardless of when it was minted, both relatively and absolutely. This is achieved by implementing an onchain IPFS encoder that makes the NFT tokenIds “IPFS native”. Essentially, the tokenId is a UINT256 encoded version of the tokenURI. You can imagine how this can make the management of cross-chain swaps and managements of NFTs much simpler, as well as making the management of L1-L2 NFT bridging much simpler. Just to be clear I have no interest in building these bridge systems myself, but am thinking about various options to experiment or integrate with existing bridge/L2 solutions, and excited to see where we can go.

Lastly, I’ve built this protocol to be a completely open and free public utility protocol, with no owner. Any company or hobbyist can just start using it without worrying about licensing issues, just treat it like node.js or ruby on rails.

- website: https://cell.computer

It’s currently in beta on Rinkeby with fully open sourced/verified code (more in the tweet thread), and planning to go live on ETH mainnet soon. 

Would appreciate any feedback. Thanks!",71.0,2022-05-19 14:01:10,0.89
Huge testing milestone for Ethereum: Ropsten testnet Merge set for June 8,"Merging Ropsten is a huge testing milestone towards Ethereum’s mainnet merge later this year,” said Preston Van Loon, an Ethereum core developer at Prysmatic Labs.

The Ethereum ecosystem is set for a “huge testing milestone” with the Ropsten testnet Merge set to be conducted on June 8.

According to the Merge testnets page on Github, Ethereum DevOps engineer Parathi Jayanathi submitted a pull request for the Ropsten testnet Merge configuration code on Monday, suggesting the implementation is ready to go.

Ropsten is one of several testnets created by the Ethereum Foundation in 2017 and which is currently maintained by the Geth developer team.

This specific testnet is seen as the best replication of the Ethereum Mainnet as it follows a similar network structure. This enables devs to conduct realistic deployment testing before making updates to the actual mainnet.

The Ropsten testnet Merge will see the proof-of-work network combined with a new proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus layer testnet, with its genesis set for May 30. It will simulate what will happen once the actual Merge between Ethereum and the Beacon Chain finally takes place and it becomes a PoS network.

Devs in the community have been posting their bullishness about the testnet news online. Preston Van Loon, an Ethereum core developer at Prysmatic Labs said that..

Layer 2 (zkSync) Swaps and Fiat On-Ramp are Now Live on Numio,"Hello /r/ethereum,

Our timing for this release couldn’t be much worse but bears haven’t stopped us building before and they won’t stop us now.

[Numio](https://www.numio.one/) is a non-custodial, Layer 2 Ethereum, mobile app available on Android and iOS. First released in 2020, we were the first app to be built on zkSync.

## What's new?

**Layer 2 Swaps** \- we’ve added Layer 2 Swaps with our [ZigZag](https://info.zigzag.exchange/) integration which means you can swap tokens quickly and cheaply on the zkSync network.

The cost for a swap is currently under $0.50 - the cheapest I have swapped for is £0.07.

We’ve added the following pairs for now but will be adding loads more (>75) very soon.

* ETH/USDC
* ETH/USDT
* USDC/USDT

**Layer 2 fiat on-ramp** \- you can now purchase crypto directly on zkSync. This feature is supported by our [MoonPay](https://www.moonpay.com/) integration and saves you a lot on gas fees.

**NFTs** \-You can view and interact with your NFT collection in the app.

## A Note on Privacy and Fees on Numio

Numio is non-custodial - you generate your own private keys within the app and can download your private keys at any time.

You can stay pseudonymous - you don’t need to give an email, phone number, or complete KYC to use Numio - all you need is a username.

Downloading and signing up for Numio is free. Whether you are using Layer 1 or Layer 2, we won’t charge you to make an account or create a wallet.

## Feedback

As always we appreciate all the feedback we get, so please let us know if you have any comments, requests, or criticisms - we’re always working to improve.

Thanks",39.0,2022-05-18 09:53:34,0.94
Differences between stablecoins by collateral,"At Wido, we tried to look at the differences between stablecoins as of May 1st, approximately 1 week before UST crashed.

Stablecoins achieve price stability through collateralisation. There are different types of collateral (cash or other crypto assets), let’s explore it for a few stablecoins – USDC, UST, DAI, FRAX and LUSD.

# USDC

https://preview.redd.it/gnkmj6lpguz81.png?width=1684&format=png&auto=webp&s=135b652023acbfd2ae857786db7a890bc7d98662

In the chart above, USDC stands out of the crew. As of May 1, 2022, there was 49B USDC issued, fully backed by US dollars.

Let’s zoom in to better see the rest of the picture. We will purposefully keep UST for the end.

&#x200B;

# DAI

https://preview.redd.it/lw3syd8wguz81.png?width=1682&format=png&auto=webp&s=bf9fcae6ab654c1c267848dd12ef0d2f654a2045

DAI is an over-collateralized stablecoin, backed by various types of crypto collateral, most notably ETH, WBTC and USDC, as well as real-world assets such as real estate.

As of May 1, 2022, there was \~ **8.46 billion** DAI in circulation backed by approximately **$13.14 billion** worth of collateral, most notably $5.96 billion worth of ETH and 4.37 billion USDC, resulting in a collateralization ratio of **155%**.

Notably, as of May 1, 2022, there also was $1.29B worth of MKR (protocol market cap) that serves as a backstop to protect the dollar peg.

FRAX is an algorithmic stablecoin, partially backed by USDC stable-coin and FXS (Frax Share Token).

As of May 1, 2022, there was **2.7 billion** FRAX in circulation and the protocol’s collateralization ratio was sitting at **86.75%**, which equals approximately **$2.34 billion** in USDC collateral.

There also was $1.41B worth of FXS serving as a backstop to protect the dollar peg.

Liquity USD is an over-collateralized stablecoin, backed by ETH.

As of May 1, 2022, there was **479 million** LUSD in circulation, backed by 364 thousand ETH worth approximately **$997 million**, resulting in a collateralization ratio of **208%**.

Note: For Liquity, as per their docs, the LQTY token does not serve as a back-stopping mechanism.

In the case of UST, as of May 1, 2022, there was 18.56B of UST total issued.

LFG collateral worth $1B consisted mostly of BTC. On top of that, there was $27.15B worth of Luna, which served as the backstop mechanism.

"Layer 2 in 2022: Are You Ready for Rollups, Bridges, New Apps, Life With Ethereum 2.0, and Layer 3?","We all recall this is a pivotal year for Ethereum layer 2 (L2) solutions so what happens over the coming months will be critical in making decentralized finance (DeFi) work better, faster, and more reliably for a far greater number of users.  

Last year saw L2 solutions roll out with great promise, increasing the number of decentralized apps across verticals such as exchanges, marketplaces, wallets, bridges, and more. Yet the growing user base and total value locked on Ethereum L2 were eclipsed by alternative layer 1 blockchains emerging to fill the market gaps that persisted such as Ethereum’s scalability issues.

   With multiple apps deployed across chains, we are now seeing increasing fragmentation that adds complexity for end-users and detracts from the ultimate goal of making DeFi accessible for all. We have seen chains like smartchain develop cheap, fast and highly efficient solutions which helps launching of projects like Cake, Minosis, Xvs etc even more accesible.  Ethereum creator Vitalik Buterin has claimed that (L2s or) “rollups are in the short and medium-term, and possibly in the long term, the only trustless scaling solution for Ethereum”. 

 We have seen this start to play out, with the total value locked (TVL) in layer 2 protocols such as StarkNet, Arbitrum, and Boba Network growing from USD 50 million to a high of USD 7 billion.  I look forward to what follows, do you think the L2 will be a total success?",261.0,2022-05-15 18:45:09,0.88
How to sell ethereum without proof of address?,"I have some eth, but I can't find a website to sell it on. I used to use coinbase, but it looks like they don't accept norwegian cards anymore. I moved out of Norway a while back, and don't have access to any documents from the last 3 months proving my address there. I also don't have these documents where I'm staying right now.

Is there a website I could sell on? I've tried zipmex and coinbase as well, but no dice.",237.0,2022-05-15 17:28:36,0.99
"Vitalik himself said that the goal of Ethereum isn’t million-dollar pictures of monkeys, it’s to accomplish meaningful things in the world.","I’m not against NFT art, after all its another integral part of the Ethereum ecosystem. However, I am against the HUGE amounts of resources that are being poured in the NFT market. Resources that will not result in anything of real utility or impact in the real world.

Vitalik’s vision is for Ethereum to be the portal which people will use to integrate themselves and their lifestyle into the digital world. His vision is for Ethereum to be able to solve real world problems and eventually, down the line, make decentralization the norm and end the tyranny of centralized authorities over our lives. I know this may sound a bit “poetic” right now but this is the real long term vision.

This is exactly why I love to see that there are indeed a select few projects that have been following this vision, a lot of which are DAOs which fits great with Vitalik's ideals. There are DAOs out there like BitDAO aiding this vision with more than $500 million ETH in their treasury being allocated toward expanding the DeFi space on Ethereum and improving its adoption rates. Crazy to think that a DAO is the 43rd largest ETH holder meaning that they truly do believe in the long term vision of Ethereum.

Hopefully we keep seeing more resources being allocated toward the utilitarian side of Ethereum cause this is the only way to prove that crypto will indeed solve everyday problems and make life all the better. All these billions of dollars combined can be put into much better use. But that's just my (and Vitalik's) personal opinion.",1123.0,2022-05-14 20:32:16,0.95
the only way the Ethereum would ever accomplish mainstream status is through this merge. Energy consumption will go down by 99% meaning that Ethereum will finally be able to experience mass mainstream adoption.,"Some people are really underestimating what this merge means exactly. A lot of people know that it will definitely drive consumption WAY lower, but not many realize that this means Ethereum is going one step forward towards attaining mainstream status.

Aside from the fact that retail companies are pushing all in for eco-friendliness, these companies can’t operate on Ethereum as long as it's PoW.

Of course, we still need to wait for sharding for Ethereum to actually start showing its real efficiency, but there are already enough scaling solutions to compensate for that in my opinion.

These scaling solutions and L2s aren’t playing. Polygon alone has already partnered with so many mainstream traditional companies like Ernst & Young, Dolce & Gabbana, Twitter, Instagram and most importantly Stripe which is a BIG step for crypto as a whole considering Stripe is the 6th largest Fintech company in the world and the 5th most used payment app in the US.

And the fact that this company is using Ethereum (even if it’s through an EVM chain like Polygon) insights a lot of hope that Ethereum is on the right path toward mainstream adoption.",504.0,2022-05-14 16:30:26,0.83

Current recommendation is that if you are able to disconnect your wallet from these sites you should do so until the scope and success rate of these attacks is able to be confirmed and contained.

If you receive a request for connection on a site you would not normally expect to see one (ie as your wallet is already showing as connected) please regard it as suspicious and take appropriate precautions.

**Frequently Asked Questions**

**Where's the best place to buy ETH?**

There are many centralized exchanges that support Ethereum. If you live in the US, the most popular exchanges are Coinbase, Gemeni and Kraken. Coinbase users can use Coinbase Pro for lower fees.

**When is Eth2 launching?**

Eth2 is a marketing term used to represent a number of updates to Ethereum. The Eth2 proof-of-stake chain first launched in December 2020. ""The Merge"", which is the event that will fully switch Ethereum's consensus to proof-of-stake, is estimated to be ready in early 2022, although there is no exact timeline. Other updates, such as data shards, will follow that update.

Visit [ethmerge.com](https://ethmerge.com/) to learn more about ""The Merge"".

**Do I need to do anything to update to Eth2? Will Eth2 create a new token?**

No, ETH holders *never* need to take any action to keep holding ETH. Ethereum users will be unaffected by the Eth2 upgrade. And the Eth2 updates will not create any new tokens.

**How can I stake my ETH?**

There are two ways that you can stake your ETH: by running your own validator, or providing your ETH to a staking pool.

* Running your own validator requires a modern computer and 32 ETH. Visit /r/ethstaker for more details
* Staking pools accept any amount of ETH. We recommend [Lido](https://lido.fi/) or [StakeWise](https://stakewise.io/)

**Why are Ethereum transaction fees so high?**

Like most blockchains, Ethereum fees are determined by supply-and-demand. The large demand to use Ethereum has pushed transaction fees quite high (however, fees were just a few cents only 2 years ago). Fees are especially high during market volatility, and during NFT drops.

**What is being done to lower Ethereum transaction fees?**

Ethereum fees are reduced by using layer-2 rollups. Rollups are scaling solutions that allow for significantly cheaper transactions, while still maintaining Ethereum's security.

Additionally, Eth2's data shards will make rollups even cheaper.

**What's the best wallet for Ethereum?**

The most popular tool for using decentralized applications is Metamask. However, for security reasons, we recommend using a hardware wallet such as a Trezor or Ledger.

Trust Wallet Restored But Empty Wallet,"My iPhone recently died (touch screen issues) and had to bring the phone to Apple Store.

After waiting for couple of hours they told me it couldn’t be fixed and ended up giving me a new one.

I restored the Trust Wallet backup using my 12 seed phrase but the Wallet is empty. I had 3 Ethereums.

Do I need to a further step to restore this? Could it have been stolen by the person who had the original and thus had access to the Wallet on the phone?

Not going to lie, I’m panicking here. Help.

Edit: I got it back, while checking the address it popped up I guess it was a syncing issue!

Tried out the Arbitrum Layer 2 tonight.,"I basically only stake ETH using Lido built into Ledger Live.  During low gas times (around 20gwei) you can stake with Lido using Ledger live for about $6 - $8 in gas fees.

The research I have been doing says I need to move to an L2 as most of retail will only use those in the future.

I decided to give it a try tonight.

I transferred $100 to my Ledger Nano S+ and connected it to MetaMask.  I then went to Arbitrums site and deposited the $100 of ETH into the L2 using the bridge.  Gas was around $7 (22 Gwei) at the time.  So I ended up with $93.  

That was successful and I now show $93 of ETH on the Arbitrum network on my Ledger connected to MetaMask.

I then went to Uniswap, connected my wallet to the Arbitrum network and swapped ETH for rETH.  The fee was only $0.65.  It would have been $24 if I had done it on the mainnet.  So 36x cheaper than the Ethereum mainnet.

So this may not have been the best test as I could have staked with Lido for roughly the same gas fees and it’s much easier using the ledger live interface, but I wanted to learn how to move to an layer 2.

It does get me very excited for the potential of the ethereum ecosystem when Layer 2s are the go to for retail investors and we don’t have to interact with the layer 1 directly anymore.

It’s obviously still early days and it’s needs to be a little easier before mass adoption happens, but I know that will come in time.

I really like that I can still do it all using my Ledger and not have to give up on using a hardware wallet.

That’s my story for my fun filled Saturday night!",139.0,2022-05-08 03:31:23,0.95
Question about debt,"So I have recently gotten into monetary theory. Basically, transactions in the world of fiat are pretty much all just debt being thrown around in the form of government currencies or bank deposits. This means that most transactions change the amount of debt and thereby the amount of money in circulation.

Now, my question is this: Since many coins has a fixed supply but can be lent out, is there a way of knowing how much there actually is including the debt? Do you know any reliable data sources to find out how much bitcoin (or other crypto currencies) have been lent? 

I think this might be especially interesting for DeFi since I wouldn't be surprised if a large amount of ETH for example might be borrowed multiple times. That's kinda what yield farming is about right? Also any form of investing on margin.

"How to stake less than 32 ETH in your own wallet, no lockup, mininal fees","A lot of people use centralized exchanges to stake small amount of ETH, but thereby they give them custody over their coins.

There is actually a very easy way to stake ETH in your own wallet decentralized, without any lockup and with mininal fees of only a few dollars. 

It works through layer 2 Arbitrum and the decentralized staking pool Rocket Pool!

First you need to get ETH to your Arbitrum account. Most big centralized exchanges support withdrawals to Arbitrum, for example Binance or Crypto.com. If you have ETH on mainnet, there is also a bridge from Ethereum mainnet to Arbitrum, but using centralized exchanges to bridge will be cheaper for gas.

You can now use metamask to access your arbitrum account. [Here](https://help.uniswap.org/en/articles/5538707-how-to-connect-to-arbitrum) is a tutorial on how to connect your metamask to the arbitrum network.

After you can access your Arbitrum funds on metamask, there is only one thing left to do: Go to Uniswap and swap your ETH to rETH (Rocket Pool ETH) 

You can do that through this link: [Uniswap](https://app.uniswap.org/#/swap?inputCurrency=ETH&outputCurrency=0xec70dcb4a1efa46b8f2d97c310c9c4790ba5ffa8&chain=arbitrum). (You might have to switch the network to Arbitrum on Uniswap first)

The swap will only cost around $2 dollars on Arbitrum. So you pay less than $5 total in fees, including the exchange withdrawal.

The value of rETH will automatically increase over time compared to ETH, because the staking rewards that are earned through staking in Rocket Pool automatically flow into the value of rETH. At the beginning of Rocket Pool, 1 rETH was equal to 1 ETH. Right now, 1 rETH = 1.02 ETH. 

If the staking pool earns 5% staking rewards every year, the rETH/ETH ratio will go up by 5% in the same amount of time. Thats how you earn your staking rewards.

You can swap your rETH back to ETH at anytime to 'unstake' your ETH.

**Frequently Asked Questions**

**Where's the best place to buy ETH?**

There are many centralized exchanges that support Ethereum. If you live in the US, the most popular exchanges are Coinbase, Gemeni and Kraken. Coinbase users can use Coinbase Pro for lower fees.

**When is Eth2 launching?**

Eth2 is a marketing term used to represent a number of updates to Ethereum. The Eth2 proof-of-stake chain first launched in December 2020. ""The Merge"", which is the event that will fully switch Ethereum's consensus to proof-of-stake, is estimated to be ready in early 2022, although there is no exact timeline. Other updates, such as data shards, will follow that update.

Visit [ethmerge.com](https://ethmerge.com/) to learn more about ""The Merge"".

**Do I need to do anything to update to Eth2? Will Eth2 create a new token?**

No, ETH holders *never* need to take any action to keep holding ETH. Ethereum users will be unaffected by the Eth2 upgrade. And the Eth2 updates will not create any new tokens.

**How can I stake my ETH?**

There are two ways that you can stake your ETH: by running your own validator, or providing your ETH to a staking pool.

* Running your own validator requires a modern computer and 32 ETH. Visit /r/ethstaker for more details
* Staking pools accept any amount of ETH. We recommend [Lido](https://lido.fi/) or [StakeWise](https://stakewise.io/)

**Why are Ethereum transaction fees so high?**

Like most blockchains, Ethereum fees are determined by supply-and-demand. The large demand to use Ethereum has pushed transaction fees quite high (however, fees were just a few cents only 2 years ago). Fees are especially high during market volatility, and during NFT drops.

**What is being done to lower Ethereum transaction fees?**

Ethereum fees are reduced by using layer-2 rollups. Rollups are scaling solutions that allow for significantly cheaper transactions, while still maintaining Ethereum's security.

Additionally, Eth2's data shards will make rollups even cheaper.

While rollups are cutting-edge technology being actively developed, a number are already live on Ethereum mainnet. Visit [l2beat.com](https://l2beat.com/) to learn more about rollups.

**What's the best wallet for Ethereum?**

The most popular tool for using decentralized applications is Metamask. However, for security reasons, we recommend using a hardware wallet such as a Trezor or Ledger.

Most wallets I can find are either closed-source or only partly open-source. However this is unacceptable to me as using these wallets would require trust, which I do not want to rely on when it comes to cryptocurrencies.

Also, ideally I'd be able to either start a local geth instance right from the wallet or at least be able to point the wallet to a locally run instance.  

Hardware wallet integration would be very welcome, too.

More North Korean-linked ETH Wallets are being sanctioned by the US Treasury after the $600 million Ronin hack.,"US authorities are enforcing a broader set of penalties against putative North Korean cryptocurrency wallets. On Friday, three Ethereum domains were basically introduced to the Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Asset Control or OFAC sanctions database. Among those three Ethereum, one address was actually named last week. The US authorities linked to the loss of about $610 million in cryptocurrency from Axie Infinity's Ronin bridge. 

Over the previous week, all three accounts had received large incoming transactions. That money is basically looted ether (ETH) from the officially sanctioned wallet. North Korea's Lazarus hackers squad, according to the FBI as well as OFAC, has been diverting funds. They were transferring them from a permitted account to an intermediate address prior to actually transferring the cash to Tornado Cash. Tornado Cash is a mixer intended to conceal the destination address of monies transferred via the service. Companies 

This money laundering process was even replicated on Friday. Money was again transferred from one of the recently sanctioned addresses to a third-party middleman before returning to Tornado Cash.

Tornado Cash has never personally communicated with any of the permitted addresses.
Because of the architecture of Tornado Cash, the company's operators can't ban addresses. The OFAC mandates any entity dealing with the US banking system. 

The mixer has included a compliance tool from Chainalysis. It is a blockchain intelligence business that allows it to ban specific addresses. However, only on the decentralised customer software that Tornado Cash's operators have control over. Individuals can still circumvent this certification tool by using the method itself. Furthermore, the Chainalysis program only revealed the initially approved address as of the previous week.
""OFAC is the arbiter of what addresses have to be actually blocked,"" a Tornado Cash spokesperson initially told CoinDesk.

""So far, it's been a guessing game. It is presume OFAC has found just one address that should be basically authorised in connection with that occurrence. That is to say, Chainalysis modifies whatever is on the penalty list ""explained the spokesperson. Facing all these captivating it has become important to have cryptocurrencies that are easy to track, projects like Polygon, Point Network, Theta, etc, are good examples which can be useful for facilitating multiple transactions which are easy to track.",27.0,2022-04-29 03:03:18,0.85
To any new comer. The merge will reduce energy consumption by a huge margin but won’t have a significant affect on gas fees. Sharding is what will reduce gas fees.,"
While a considerable number of users on the subreddit have been using Ethereum, L2s and sidechains for a while, there are also new comers joining everyday (niceeee).

I’m seeing a couple posts here and there about “how will the merge affect gas fees?” and comments about “should I sell my L2 and sidechain tokens?”

The answer is no. In fact, the merge will most probably drive more activity on the platform making traffic worse which might theoretically increase the demand on scaling solutions overall.

The end goal is to reach ETH2.0 which is a phenomenally more advanced version of the Ethereum we have now. But that will happen in slow steps and phases. Part of these steps is lowering energy consumption which is the whole idea behind the merge from PoW to PoS.

For now keep your L2 tokens and maybe even accumulate more to cash in on a decent profit. Personally I’m betting my money on Polygon. They already have the largest number of daily active users between all scaling solutions plus it kinda easiest to build on seeing that they already have 19,000 dApps onboard.

I also think Optimism might have a chance at making it big especially after the recent updates with the token release but I tend to lean more towards zk tech honestly cause I personally think it’s much more superior and has more potential for the long term.",130.0,2022-04-29 01:26:08,0.93

How to save 90% in gas on Ethereum,"Transactions on Ethereum can easily [cost more than $200 in gas](https://etherscan.io/tx/0x7e3744801b5b5ecf54cee34d80abd07a1f1e401f3d6abd7a9539c7b1b4ae3736). Many projects work hard to solve this problem. Some say you need alternative chains outside of Ethereum. Others say L2s are the solution, and everything needs to stay tightly connected to Ethereum.

Regardless of which camp you support, the truth is that most value is still sitting on Ethereum L1, where gas is unbearable. [According to DeFiLlama](https://defillama.com/chains), $113.89B is locked on Ethereum, with Terra as second and third BSC. In the [Ethereum Layer 2 space](https://l2beat.com/), Arbitrum leads the charts with $3.65B locked, followed by dYdX ($1.00B TVL) and Optimism ($686M TVL). Most interesting apps and opportunities are still on Ethereum.

Many of us have deposits inside protocols on Ethereum. Sometimes, those deposits are not large, and it is economically infeasible to withdraw (gas costs more than the deposit is worth). Or we want to deposit into some smart contract that only exists on Ethereum today, but high gas prices are holding us off.

A question arises: **Is there a way to save gas on Ethereum L1 today before everyone moves to L2s and alternative chains?**

Batch transactions let people save up to 90% in gas on Ethereum L1. Instead of sending a costly transaction on your own, you can batch it with other people and split the gas. Let me explain how batch transactions work using the following diagram:

[Single Transaction \(left\), Batch Transaction \(right\)](https://preview.redd.it/nnw0hh5r2aw81.png?width=1650&format=png&auto=webp&s=c9c1d0f954265a51b2e6cf8b5e7489eb9eda0dc3)

The left part of the diagram shows a single (non-batch) transaction which costs 1M in gas for the user.

The right part shows when multiple users join a batch transaction. Extra “batch smart contract” is involved, which serves as a proxy between the users and the “expensive smart contract”. In this case, funds are pulled into the batch smart contract (gas cost is only 90k) from all batch users and deposited into the “expensive smart contract” as a single transaction.

The result is that in the case of batch transactions, each user only pays 363.33k in gas. This equals 69% in gas savings with just 3 batch participants. Savings increase with more people in the batch.

&#x200B;

**Many people successfully batched their transactions and saved in gas using Wido Batch Transactions.**

Following are examples of recent batch transactions and gas savings:

(2) Withdraw USDC from yvUSDC 0.3.0 and deposit into yvUSDC 0.4.3 (vault migration)

* Batch size: 7 users
* Total batch transaction value (in USD): $226,905

**How much gas can batch transactions save?**

Below is a chart showing the ratio between gas savings and batch size. It was calculated for [this transaction](https://etherscan.io/tx/0x7e3744801b5b5ecf54cee34d80abd07a1f1e401f3d6abd7a9539c7b1b4ae3736) (deposit USDC into the Curve Frax vault by [yearn.finance](https://yearn.finance/) using a Zap). The numbers will differ slightly for different transactions.

[Gas savings based on number of users in a batch](https://preview.redd.it/an77mhc93aw81.png?width=2082&format=png&auto=webp&s=ee525587073d07f0228438bc9ef676144dc1965f)

As you can see, with just three people in the batch, everyone saves 60% in gas. With 20 batch participants, the gas savings are almost 90% for each batch participant.

It's fully *open source* and the Alpha release is ready to try out!

**Edit:**   
Upcoming NiceNode updates will include...  
• Options to run other Ethereum clients  
• Run nodes with Docker  
• Clear controls for common client settings  
• The groundwork for running Layer 2 nodes

**Edit2:**  
A few comments asking ""what is the reason for running a full node?""  
Here is a quote on what a full node does from [ethereum.org](https://ethereum.org/)

I've been paid for some work I carried out in ETH. Is it standard procedure for the payee to bear the transaction fees?,"So yeah quick question. Probably rather obvious that if you agree to pay somebody X you pay them X. 

However Im pretty new to ethereum. I am kind of working for somebody and they agreed to pay me 0.04 ETH for the task. 

I got paid, but it seems like they paid me 0.04 minus the fees, so I ended up with slightly less, rather than 0.04 plus transaction fee.

Being rather new Im not sure if this is the norm, like if you pay somebody is it expected that you also pay the transaction fee? I know its a rather dumb question but I want to be sure I am not violating the norm or some unspoken rule before I tell the person they were short. We didnt agree anything in advance, just told the amount I would be paid.",34.0,2022-04-27 13:40:55,0.92
How are smart contracts tested before deployment to the Eth Mainnet?,"Hi All, sorry if this is a stupid question. Say I was developing a smart contract and wanted to test how it functioned on a working blockchain without deploying it and paying gas fees/making it public.

Are developers able to run a ""private"" version of an Ethereum blockchain on their own systems with miners (and trivial mining difficulty for quick testing). Or simulated POS of course.

Really interested in learning more about how things work practically from a software development point of view. Thanks!!",20.0,2022-04-27 11:40:19,0.92
Ethereum scaling solution Optimism upgrades governance structure,"Optimism Foundation will launch a governance token called OP to govern protocol and network parameters, and incentivize adoption.

The Optimism Foundation has unveiled a new governance structure and token as part of its ongoing efforts to bring scalability and cost efficiency to Ethereum (ETH), the world’s largest smart contract platform. 


 
The “Optimism Collective” was introduced Tuesday afternoon in a lengthy post that outlined its mission and governance mandate. Described as a “large-scale experiment in digital democratic governance,” the Optimism Collective essentially comprises a band of communities and stakeholders committed to improving Ethereum’s technical capabilities.

According to the details, the Optimism Collective will be governed by two components: the Citizens’ House and the Token House. The Citizens’ House will “facilitate and govern a process to distribute retroactive public goods funding” via revenues collected by the network. The Token House, which will be established through forthcoming airdrops, is tasked with..

Why do people borrow on DeFi lending platforms?,"I noticed that most lending platforms will ask you to deposit a collateral that is at the very least equal 1:1, if not higher than the loan amount.

Its fairly standard practice for protocols to limit a user's borrowing option to 75% of their collateral.

Why would anyone seek to borrow crypto by locking another one as collateral when they could simply trade one for another on an exchange, and at much lower rates than the massive rates we see on DeFi lending platforms?",179.0,2022-04-26 07:27:24,0.9

5 DeFi Risks," I just finished a 2 hour readthrough of Nic Carter's & Linda Jeng's 'DeFi Protocol Risks: The Paradox of DeFi' for the Ethereum Audible Podcast. They point out 5 key risks - which have all come true over the past year.

Here's a brief summary of the 36 page article and 5 risks.

DeFi is growing and is quickly on its way to becoming a new financial paradigm. But...there are financial risks in DeFi that manifest in new ways that we haven’t seen in the traditional financial system. The 5 risks pointed out are:

1. Interconnections with the traditional financial system
2. Operational risks stemming from underlying blockchains
3. Smart contract-based vulnerabilities
4. Other governance and regulatory risks
5. Scalability challenges.

Let's look at each.

1. **Interconnections with the traditional financial system:**

Stablecoins are the main connection to the existing financial system. They're pegged to fiat, but also via custodian banks. Stablecoins are one of the killer apps for crypto, but offer a centralization risk. Lyn Alden covers stablecoin centralization risk in her article: ""Proof-of-Stake and Stablecoins: A Blockchain Centralization Dilemma"" (did a readthrough of that a few weeks ago: [https://open.spotify.com/episode/3cTMt0friaFdmWwJvbDtmX?si=2MYAbps7Ra-fq50oEbCmUg](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3cTMt0friaFdmWwJvbDtmX?si=2MYAbps7Ra-fq50oEbCmUg))

2. **Operational risks stemming from underlying blockchains**

Consensus failures (aka what happened to [SOL](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23SOL) recently), protocol changes, changing security assurances (PoW or PoS) all can be risk vectors for any protocol built on top.

3. **Smart contract-based vulnerabilities**

All the bugs you can imagine that allow draining of funds. Most famous of which - the DAO hack, but also most recently the Wormhole hack. Oracle attacks also are a vulnerability vector ([https://www.theverge.com/2022/2/3/22916111/wormhole-hack-github-error-325-million-theft-ethereum-solana](https://www.theverge.com/2022/2/3/22916111/wormhole-hack-github-error-325-million-theft-ethereum-solana))

4. **Other governance and regulatory risks**

These risks include bad regulation or multi sig management - aka Axie's Ronin hack. Flash loans can be used to sway governance as well - a new risk unique to DeFi, aka the Beanstalk attack last week.

5. **Scalability challenges**

Inelastic block space can lead to high fees, irregular execution or transactions that don't go through at all - which lead to unexpected edge cases.

To bring it all together, DeFi is developing super fast, bringing more innovation to the financial world than any time since the 1800s. But it comes with new sets of risk. We're in heading west, as they like to say on Bankless!

**Frequently Asked Questions**

**Where's the best place to buy ETH?**

There are many centralized exchanges that support Ethereum. If you live in the US, the most popular exchanges are Coinbase, Gemeni and Kraken. Coinbase users can use Coinbase Pro for lower fees.

**When is Eth2 launching?**

Eth2 is a marketing term used to represent a number of updates to Ethereum. The Eth2 proof-of-stake chain first launched in December 2020. ""The Merge"", which is the event that will fully switch Ethereum's consensus to proof-of-stake, is estimated to be ready in early 2022, although there is no exact timeline. Other updates, such as data shards, will follow that update.

Visit [ethmerge.com](https://ethmerge.com/) to learn more about ""The Merge"".

**Do I need to do anything to update to Eth2? Will Eth2 create a new token?**

No, ETH holders *never* need to take any action to keep holding ETH. Ethereum users will be unaffected by the Eth2 upgrade. And the Eth2 updates will not create any new tokens.

**How can I stake my ETH?**

There are two ways that you can stake your ETH: by running your own validator, or providing your ETH to a staking pool.

* Running your own validator requires a modern computer and 32 ETH. Visit /r/ethstaker for more details
* Staking pools accept any amount of ETH. We recommend [Lido](https://lido.fi/) or [StakeWise](https://stakewise.io/)

**Why are Ethereum transaction fees so high?**

Like most blockchains, Ethereum fees are determined by supply-and-demand. The large demand to use Ethereum has pushed transaction fees quite high (however, fees were just a few cents only 2 years ago). Fees are especially high during market volatility, and during NFT drops.

**What is being done to lower Ethereum transaction fees?**

Ethereum fees are reduced by using layer-2 rollups. Rollups are scaling solutions that allow for significantly cheaper transactions, while still maintaining Ethereum's security.

Additionally, Eth2's data shards will make rollups even cheaper.

While rollups are cutting-edge technology being actively developed, a number are already live on Ethereum mainnet. Visit [l2beat.com](https://l2beat.com/) to learn more about rollups.

**What's the best wallet for Ethereum?**

The most popular tool for using decentralized applications is Metamask. However, for security reasons, we recommend using a hardware wallet such as a Trezor or Ledger.

You can’t love Ethereum without loving scaling solutions. Ethereum is L2s and scaling solutions at this point,"Like it or hate it, this statement is true.
Ethereum did A LOT of hard work establishing itself as the first and best multi-use chain on the market and cemented its reputation as one of the safest chains out there.

However, becoming the best in one thing, and maintaining that status is another. And so far (at least statistically) Ethereum is the best chain out there in terms of sheer numbers.

This status wouldn’t have possibly been sustainable without scaling solutions stepping up their game and helping people operate Ethereum.

And this can all be clearly seen with commit chains like Polygon have more daily active users than Ethereum itself considering you literally pay pennies there compared to double digit gas fees on Ethereum along with things like beinf able to mint NFTs for free there.

People want to use Ethereum so bad but would rather do that through scaling solutions.

Ethereum and chains on-top of it going greener honestly makes me happier than all the money and pumps in the world.,"I care about the environment more than all the money and technology in the world. I mean just think about it, If there is no earth then what the hell are you going to do with all your Ethereum or your ""lambo"" bruh? This is the one gripe that a lot of people have with cryptocurrency and why they tend to avoid it completely. I don't avoid it completely but this is STILL something I have issues with and I feel like it isn't talked about enough. 

One thing that I don't think is talked about enough is that Ethereum switching to PoS is going to GREATLY reduce it's carbon footprint. This honestly makes me incredibly excited and it makes me want to use nothing but Ethereum and other PoS chains like Polygon. It is built on Ethereum anyway so it's mostly still on the Ethereum ecosystem IMO. Polygon also very recently put 20 million dollars towards making it's chain environmentally positive, meaning that it's trying to help the environment and undo damage rather than kill it.

I think we all want mass adoption for Ethereum and I think this is a way bigger step towards that than people realize. Crypto is a long-term game and what Ethereum is aiming to achieve is a long-term game. Being the foundation for the web3 layer is going to require a ton of sustainability and I think this is an incredible step foward in the right direction for Ethereum. I believe this will bring a ton of environmentally conscious people towards Ethereum over other chains as well.",34.0,2022-04-13 12:35:48,0.73

Ethereum One Step Closer To PoS After Implementation of First Shadow Fork,"Ethereum developers have announced the first successful implementation of a “shadow fork” on the network, which is a big step towards shifting the network to proof-of-stake.

The shadow fork creates a platform for ETH developers to run tests before the networks shift from PoW to PoS. The Ethereum network’s merge into PoS is expected to make the network faster, cheaper, and more environmentally friendly due to the high energy consumption required to run PoW. The merge is expected to be fully implemented in the second half of 2022. So, if you are confident that it will go through without a hitch, then you might consider adding some ETH to your portfolio.

Do you think it's truly a big deal?

The Ronin Bridge Hacker's funds have been traced through Tornado Cash,"He has deposited 21600 ETH to Tornado since 4 April: https://etherscan.io/txs?a=0x098b716b8aaf21512996dc57eb0615e2383e2f96

That AVAX is obviously controlled by the hacker. What was the purpose of sending the ETH through Tornado if it can easily be traced to that AVAX address? Nobody is mixing their AVAX either. There's effectively no anonymity set on that chain.

Why wouldn't he use the routes that have the largest anonymity sets, and move smaller chunks to blend in with the crowd? For example:

A Deep Dive into the Ethereum Virtual Machine: Part I,"&#x200B;

Blockchain technology has prompted a massive shift from traditional financial architecture and has evolved from an **electronic cash system to an all-encompassing technological breakthrough** with diverse use cases. Decentralized applications (dApps), built primarily on Ethereum, showcase the true potential of decentralization.  Blockchain technology is, however, still far from mainstream adoption. Ethereum as a network is congested, transaction speeds are low, and costs are high. These issues have become barriers to scalability and have led to the birth of other blockchains.

Cross-chain integration and interoperability are imperative to overcome these barriers. A value transfer system needs to be created that allows both the users and developers to leverage the solutions offered by these new chains.

Different blockchains are written in different languages. Ethereum is written in Solidity. For a dApp to have multi-chain variants, the code needs to be re-written in all different languages, which is extremely cumbersome.

The Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) makes it easier to transfer value between Ethereum and other blockchains without the need for new infrastructure. This connects the different silos of the blockchain with similar ecosystem components and toolkits requiring little-to-no change. There is no need for developers to use different technology stacks to reimplement existing Solidity backend contracts and dApp front ends.

This paper delves into the existing solutions that help to bridge these different blockchains by simply copying the code from Ethereum to other blockchains with minimal changes thus reducing transaction costs.

## The Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)

Ethereum has become the functional layer of the blockchain and the smart contract world. A smart contract is just like any other real-world contract, except it’s digital. In programming lingo, a smart contract is a computer program consisting of self-executing pieces of code that execute when preset conditions are met. Smart contracts are written in programming languages like Solidity, Viper, Bamboo, and others. A processor does not understand programming languages and hence cannot execute smart contracts. That brings us to the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). **The EVM is the heart of the Ethereum blockchain.**

The EVM serves as a computational engine, just like a CPU, and acts as a middle layer between the smart contract and the operating system. Contracts written in programming languages are compiled to low-level machine instructions called opcodes or operational codes. The EVM uses these codes to execute specific tasks. It thus provides the **run time environment** for smart contracts on Ethereum.

Any distributed network needs to have consensus, whereby every node on the network has the same information about the state of the network. For Ethereum, the EVM enables consensus, allowing anyone to execute code in a trustless ecosystem. The outcome of execution (smart contracts) can be guaranteed and is fully deterministic. It creates a **level of abstraction** between the executing code and the executing machine.

Ethereum’s state is a large data structure that holds all accounts and balances. It is also a **machine state**, which can change from block to block according to a predefined set of rules. At any given block, there can only be a single state of the blockchain. Ethereum maintains its state with the help of EVM, which does this by defining the rules for computing a new valid state.

In short, EVM exists as one single entity maintained by thousands of connected computers running an Ethereum client. It is operating system-agnostic, and without it, each operating system would need a separate compiler.

## How the EVM Works

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/o38knrwo7os81.png?width=640&format=png&auto=webp&s=0f0665620473bc670af0cd3285758cfca0511fa4

At a **basic level**, the EVM can be considered a translator from the smart contract language to the Ethereum nodes. It enables developers to build and deploy dApps (without the need for an extensive coding background). It makes the process of creating blockchain applications much easier and more efficient while eliminating the need for powerful hardware. The EVM has no downtime and keeps all created objects safe from being modified.

At a **technical level**, EVM is a sandboxed virtual stack embedded within each Ethereum node, responsible for executing contract bytecode. Contracts written in higher-level languages, like Solidity, are compiled to EVM bytecode. The machine codes are completely isolated without any access to the network, filesystem, or any processes of the host computer (hosting the VM). Every node in the Ethereum network runs an EVM instance, which allows them to agree on executing the same instructions. Due to the set of opcodes, the EVM is Turing complete.  A Turing complete system is capable of performing any logical step of a computational function, and that means it should theoretically be able to solve any computational problem. JavaScript, the programming language which powers the worldwide web, widely uses Turing completeness. Ethereum Virtual Machines have been successfully implemented in various programming languages including C++, Java, JavaScript, Python, Ruby, and many others.

There are two types of accounts in Ethereum – **external accounts and contracts**. Every account is identified by an address, consisting of a balance, a nonce, bytecode, and stored data (*storage*). The code and storage of external accounts are empty, while contract accounts store their bytecode and the Merkle-root hash of the entire state tree. External accounts have a corresponding private key while contract accounts don’t. The actions of contract accounts are controlled by the code they host, in addition to the regular cryptographic signing of every Ethereum transaction. The creation of a contract is simply a transaction in which the receiver address is empty and its data field contains the compiled bytecode of the contract to be created.

The first thing that happens when a new contract is deployed to the Ethereum blockchain is account creation. The data sent with the transaction is executed as bytecode. This initializes the state variables in storage and determines the body of the contract being created. The process is executed only once during the lifecycle of a contract. Once a contract account has been created, there is no way to change its code. The EVM treats both accounts the same. A transaction sent from one account to the other can contain **Ether** or **binary** data (payload). If it contains code, it is executed and the payload becomes input data. If it is not set, the code sent is executed and returns the code for a new contract. During the construction, the code of the contract is empty.

Being decentralized, contracts are executed on all Ethereum nodes. This raises the risk of bad actors slowing down the network intentionally by creating a lot of complex contracts. To protect against such attacks, every opcode has a **base gas cost**. For any smart contract to be executed by the EVM, each and every line of code in Solidity requires a certain amount of gas to be executed. The gas is used as per the execution cost assigned to the instruction implemented by the EVM. 

By using the Gas mechanism, two major issues are solved. A validator is guaranteed to receive the initial prepaid amount, even if the execution fails. An execution cannot run longer than the prepaid amount would allow. Instead of looping indefinitely, the execution would run until it runs out of Gas.

When a transaction is sent to the network, validators may take the transaction, executing the associated code. The validator will ensure:

– Validity of all information on the transaction.   

– Enough funds are available to pay for the execution of the transaction.

– The EVM doesn’t run into any exceptions during the execution.

The EVM achieves Turing Completeness by enabling **an economy that charges as per the execution of software instruction instead of financial transactions**.

*This is a two-part piece written on EVM and the existing EVM options. The first part covers EVM and working at a high level. The second part gives an insight into the existing options on different blockchains.* 

*The subsequent part will cover EVMs on different blockchains.*

I fell for every NFT scam in 10 minutes,"I’m in a slump. I spent more than a year on an app that helped people build better habits. But it didn’t make any money, so I started working on an app for a big organization. Working there killed my soul.

I needed something new. While listening to the Tim Ferriss podcast, I kept hearing about Web3.

Web3 sounded like another crypto thing I didn’t want to hear about. But after the podcast; I became a believer.

Web3 was going to help us move away from big corporations to individual creators. Changing the web as we know it. No one knows where Web3 is going, but that’s part of the fun.

I started learning how to build applications for web3. Building the future would get me out of my slump. But learning takes time. I wanted to get involved right away.

A big part of Web3 is NFTs. When people think of NFTs, they think of weird internet images. People buy, sell and create these NFTs and they are all tracked on a big ledger called the blockchain.

Web3 proves who owns what. Owning an NFTs give you access to communities, bragging rights and a bunch of other stuff I don’t understand. NFTs would be my way of joining the Web3 revolution. It was the 1st of January 2022 and I wanted my own NFT.

Within minutes, it was clear I was late to the party. The most popular NFTs, “Crypto Punks” and “Bored Apes,” were going for millions. I’d missed the train before they’d released the timetable.

The lowest price I found for a popular NFT on the auction website Opensea was $30,000. What is going on? Maybe I could lowball someone for an NFT. It is an auction, after all. Fuck it, there was no minimum price to bid. I bid $20 on one of the “Cool Cats” NFTs, which go for thousands. Not sure if my bid went through. I tried again, bidding another $20 and paying the fee again. The fee had left my crypto wallet, but nothing appeared on the website. I refreshed the auction page. I had bid $20 twice. The fees I paid were almost higher than my bids. No one would accept these bids. I had just thrown money into the void.

I told myself it was ok, in uncharted land, explorers make mistakes.

I couldn’t afford anything from the auction. My low ball approach was dumb. How do I get an NFT before it’s on the auction? I then discovered minting. Minting is where you pay the fee for a new project to get your own NFT.

On the “Cool Cats” auction page, there was a link to the “Cool Cats” website. Maybe I could mint my own NFT there? The “Cool Cats” website was weird. It mentioned breeding NFTs and a lot of other things I didn’t understand. After scrolling, I realised “Cool Cats” had created all the 10,000 cat NFTs they had planned. If I wanted one, I’d have to buy it at the auction. Fuck.

On the “Cool Cats” website, they had a link to their Discord. I thought Discord was just for angry teenagers. But it’s where everything happens for NFTs. I clicked on the discord link.

I didn’t know how to use discord. When it first loaded up, I got a burst hose pipe of notifications. I was a boomer for the first time. People talking about trades, $50,000 purchases and roadmaps for new plans. I had notifications, but I had no idea how to make them disappear.

Along with the official messages, there were messages to join other communities. I joined a bunch of these communities at once. I wanted to sample all the ice creams in the store. These smaller communities had funny names like “Age of Sam”, “The Honey Badger,” and “Bored Apes Dad Club”. If Discord confused me before, I had full-blown dementia now. With each community, I got more notifications.

I tackled the groups one by one. First, I clicked “Bored Apes Dad Club”. It had 79000 members. Was that a lot? I had no idea. But if other people trusted it, I trusted it. All you had to do to verify was type a message saying ‘!join’ and then they channel messaged you with a link to a website to verify your wallet. The wallet that holds all your internet money.

I clicked on the verify link and a login popped up. This was strange. My wallet is a google chrome plugin that should always keep me logged in. Did it time out for a security measure? I typed in my password without thinking. The plugin accepted it. But it said for additional security information, it needed my secret phrase. Must be like when your phone says it needs you to enter your pin. I went and got my secret phrase and entered it. When I entered it, nothing happened. It just said error. I entered my password and secret phrase for the second time.

This is when I realized I had fucked up.

What I had entered my password and secret phrase into wasn’t the official plugin. It looked the same, but it belonged to some randomer living in a shack in a different country.

Giving away your password wasn’t the end of the world. The end of the world was that I had given away my secret phrase. You should never give away your secret phrase. With your secret phrase, anyone can access all of your accounts. I’d just given my secret phrase away twice.

I googled what to do if you’ve given your secret phrase away. Hoping for a reset password system or something. The website told me I’d fucked up. I had to transfer everything to a new account. Which meant fees to transfer and the guilt of being dumb.

Within ten seconds of not paying attention, a hacker could now access all of my internet money. This wasn’t the start I wanted for my new year.

A better person than me would have realised they needed to be more careful. But I’m not a better person. I still wanted my NFT.

I figured I had some time before the randomer would steal all my money. Like all addicts, I looked for my next hit.

Another community was offering a mint in six days. It cost about £150 to mint one NFT, this seemed expensive. But everything had been expensive. Maybe £150 was a good price? But I kept looking for a better deal.

I joined another community called ‘Littles’. Their verification didn’t require a password. This community had active members, people reporting scams, and FAQs. Maybe I just had bad luck with my first attempt?

While in the ‘Littles’. I received a message from “The little info” saying:

“WE ARE LAUNCHING A LIMITED SALE. For the new year we’re offering 777 pixels to be minted.”

I’m in luck! I clicked the link, and they’d minted 764 out of 777. Shit, I’m going to miss my opportunity. It cost £300 to mint here. I looked up the prices of the ‘littles’. The littles sold for $30,000. It was double the price to mint these compared to the other group. But these were making 100 times the rate of return. I refreshed the page, and the number had gone up to 770. There were only 7 left. It was now or never.

I scanned the website to make sure I wasn’t getting scammed. The website looked legit, with its own security certificate and the URL littlepixel.art seemed to match the discord channel.

Fortune favours the brave. I clicked on the link that said “mint”. This time, a real transaction came up with the correct price, including the fee.

Was I about to spend £300 to get my own online internet image of a cartoon bear? Yes… I was. I clicked ‘confirm’.

It went through and brought me back to the webpage. Bit underwhelming. I was hoping for some confetti. But the blockchain takes time. I went to my transaction history expecting to see a minting job; but it just said I had sent someone £300. I had no NFT in my wallet.

On the blockchain, you can see every transaction. Which meant I could look up my transaction to see where I sent my £300. Turns out I had sent £300 to a random wallet with $77,000 in it.

I went back to the littlepixel.art website. Everything looked legit, but the links on the top didn’t work. Fuck.

In the scam section of the discord, someone had reported the website as a known scam.

I thought the message from the ‘littles info’ had come from the official channel. Because of its name and profile picture. But no, it was a direct message meant to confuse boomers like me.

In only ten minutes, I’d given access to all my accounts to a randomer and then sent about £300 to another scammer.

This was a major defeat. Worst of all, it was the first thing I’d done in January 2022.

I had lost track of time as the NFT fever had taken over. I forgot my sister had got us a gift to go to a trampoline park. We were leaving for the park in five minutes. Before the person with my secret phrase stole everything I had left in my wallet, I needed to create a new account.

I set up a new wallet and attempted to transfer everything over. I clicked send. But it failed with some obscure message saying “gas fee to low”. Shit. I didn’t have time for this and didn’t feel like explaining to my sister we’d be late because I just lost £300 trying to mint an image of a teddy bear. I tried again by clicking the most recent contact in the list ‘OxFefhrysgjohjhljkklskd’ or whatever the address was. This time it sent. Thank god.

Destroyed, I walked away, never wanting to hear the word NFT again. I tried to persuade myself that it was ok. It was a tuition fee. But inside I was bitter.

On the trampolines, I tried to bounce out of my depression. Wondering if anyone else in the trampoline park had just lost money trying to buy their own “little” that morning.

After taking my anger out in the gladiator arena of the trampoline park, I got home feeling better. I still had some money to work with.

I loaded up the new wallet. It was empty. There was no way the money hadn’t gone through. It had been hours. I logged into my old wallet. It said I had sent the money.

What was going on? Maybe the person with my secret phrase had emptied the wallet? I clicked on the location I had sent the rest of my money to. It said I sent the rest of my money to the same scammers’ wallet with $77,000. That couldn’t be. I refreshed the page and tried again…

My gut tightened. I realised what had happened. When I tried to transfer the rest of my money to my new account, the first time, it error’d. Then when I tried again instead of pasting my new wallet address, I clicked the most recent contact in my addresses. Thinking it was like the most recent person you’ve called on your phone. It wasn’t. The address I clicked was the contact of the last successful transaction. I had just sent the same scammer the rest of my internet money.

This was the dumbest thing I’d ever done.

In denial, feeling like Liam Neeson, I tried to figure out who the owner of the wallet was. Hoping I could beg for my money back. I followed where the owner of the $77,000 wallet had transferred the money out. It was a bigger wallet with over $1 million. But the million dollar wallet had withdrawn the funds out in dollars via another website. I’d never know who they were. My money was gone forever, and I had no NFT to show for it.

I should scam people instead of learning how to build things.-- If you liked this you can get one free story every week here: [https://www.reecekidd.com/sign-up/](https://www.reecekidd.com/sign-up/)",151.0,2022-04-08 16:41:34,0.64
I still have hope in P2E games," I encountered a lot of P2E that needs a lot of grinding, by a lot I mean A LOT with a high entry price like [Axie infinity](https://axieinfinity.com/). Some of them started as a pretty decent and good source of income but flopped after a lot of updates to the game. 

  
But recently, I’ve been seeing great NFT games that are going to be released this year. [The Sandbox ](https://www.sandbox.game/en/?__cf_chl_tk=WO8LE2tkeidqfB_qt6SSTC_QqQk6fTKaVZ_v4fxU0bs-1649078435-0-gaNycGzNB9E)and [Ethermon](https://ethermon.io/) are two examples. Some of them are not pay-to-earn, but rather play-to-earn, and some of them have implemented an NFT rental, as [Wrejects](https://wrejects.com/) does. I’m hoping that every year, all of the games will continue to improve and make better P2E games that we can actually enjoy while earning money. I’m still looking forward to all of the upcoming games this 2022 and better game updates.  


Do you still have hope that P2Es will continue to be better?",93.0,2022-04-06 06:13:41,0.84
Crypto Hedge Fund CEO Predicts Global Adoption of Digital Assets Following Ukraine War," Crypto hedge fund veteran Su Zhu thinks widespread adoption of cryptocurrencies is inevitable as macro events accelerate use-case scenarios for blockchain technologies. In a new episode of the Uncommon Core podcast, the CEO and CIO of cryptocurrency hedge fund Three Arrows Capital says that one consequence of the US-led sanctions against Russia for invading Ukraine might be that some nations don’t go along with the prevailing trends.

"" *I think what’s likely to happen is a short-term victory for the West where Ukraine will get the better end of a deal with Russia, but then in the longer term, you will see countries really aggressively move away from overdependence on the existing financial systems.*  *The macro stuff is to understand the way the other traditional financial people view it… Basically to get in the mindset of a tourist in this market, how they think about whether or not they should own* [Bitcoin](https://www.coincarp.com/currencies/bitcoin/)*, or if they own* [Ethereum](https://www.coincarp.com/currencies/ethereum/)*.”*

The Three Arrows Capital CEO concludes by saying that the Russia-Ukraine conflict has served as a defining moment in establishing cryptocurrencies as a disruptive force.

How malicious smart contracts work,"I have a question about how malicious smart contracts work. Many people here probably have some unsolicited tokens sitting in their wallets, and whenever someone asks what to do with them, the chorus always sings ""Do NOT touch it or it will empty your wallet!"" Ok, it's a reasonable advice, but anyone has yet to explain how exactly a smart contract can empty someone's wallet. 

I have a modest experience writing smart contracts, including ERC-20 smart contracts (creating my own tokens just for fun). I also have some experience interacting  with MetaMask from a webpage via JavaScript. So, I know how a user can be scammed into approving access to their tokens and then having their wallets emptied. It's still a long shot, though, since the user needs to be completely clueless and just hit ""approve"" button without reading what it is they're approving. Obviously, this method would require luring a user to your sinister Web3-enabled website first. 

However, if we strictly talk about smart contracts and specifically ERC-20 contracts, can someone explain how calling their functions like ""transfer"" or ""approve"" can give them access to your other tokens that are not managed by these contracts? For example, if I find some shіtcoіns sitting in my wallet and want to send them to another address via MetaMask, how would it compromise my other tokens? Thanks!",21.0,2022-04-06 00:35:11,0.96
What just happened to the gas price?,"Does anyone know what happened here? I first thought I had a bug in my program. Then I checked etherscan:

edit (since the question seems unclear): I am wondering what caused people to suddenly spend thousands of euros for a single transaction. Was there a short sharp price movement? Was there some launch of any big project that people tried to front-run each other like there is no tomorrow?

**Frequently Asked Questions**

**Where's the best place to buy ETH?**

There are many centralized exchanges that support Ethereum. If you live in the US, the most popular exchanges are Coinbase, Gemeni and Kraken. Coinbase users can use Coinbase Pro for lower fees.

**When is Eth2 launching?**

Eth2 is a marketing term used to represent a number of updates to Ethereum. The Eth2 proof-of-stake chain first launched in December 2020. ""The Merge"", which is the event that will fully switch Ethereum's consensus to proof-of-stake, is estimated to be ready in early 2022, although there is no exact timeline. Other updates, such as data shards, will follow that update.

Visit [ethmerge.com](https://ethmerge.com/) to learn more about ""The Merge"".

**Do I need to do anything to update to Eth2? Will Eth2 create a new token?**

No, ETH holders *never* need to take any action to keep holding ETH. Ethereum users will be unaffected by the Eth2 upgrade. And the Eth2 updates will not create any new tokens.

**How can I stake my ETH?**

There are two ways that you can stake your ETH: by running your own validator, or providing your ETH to a staking pool.

* Running your own validator requires a modern computer and 32 ETH. Visit /r/ethstaker for more details
* Staking pools accept any amount of ETH. We recommend [Lido](https://lido.fi/) or [StakeWise](https://stakewise.io/)

**Why are Ethereum transaction fees so high?**

Like most blockchains, Ethereum fees are determined by supply-and-demand. The large demand to use Ethereum has pushed transaction fees quite high (however, fees were just a few cents only 2 years ago). Fees are especially high during market volatility, and during NFT drops.

**What is being done to lower Ethereum transaction fees?**

Ethereum fees are reduced by using layer-2 rollups. Rollups are scaling solutions that allow for significantly cheaper transactions, while still maintaining Ethereum's security.

Additionally, Eth2's data shards will make rollups even cheaper.

While rollups are cutting-edge technology being actively developed, a number are already live on Ethereum mainnet. Visit [l2beat.com](https://l2beat.com/) to learn more about rollups.

**What's the best wallet for Ethereum?**

The most popular tool for using decentralized applications is Metamask. However, for security reasons, we recommend using a hardware wallet such as a Trezor or Ledger.

Any tips on how to store seed phrase to be accessed from anywhere?,"When thinking about storing seed phrases one of the most common thought is writing it in a paper and store it in some secure place in home. That could be ok to some people, but when the person doesn't feel secure even at home (it could happen for a sort of reasons, local government threats, familiar distrust, natural disaster possibilities, etc), storing it at home could be high risk.

So I'm wondering if there's a security way to store seed phrases and being able to access it from anywhere without a necessity to transport a physical paper with it.

The first thought could be storing it in a cloud, but it also might be very insecure, although in some cases storing at home could be even more.

I'm thinking if a mixed storing would be a good choice, per example, splitting the seed phrase among two or three different clouds. 

Does anyone have any suggestion or opinion?",26.0,2022-04-03 18:27:00,0.8
What happens to ETH lost when staking?,"I've been doing a lot of research into POW vs POS recently. Many sources talk about the advantages of POS, as well as the repercussions of cheating the system. Everyone seems to agree that a selected validator who cheats gets their staked currency taken away (hence why the currency is at stake). I haven't been able to find out what happens to the staked currency after it has been taken from a cheater, however. Does it just evaporate into the ether (pun intended)? Does it get redistributed as a reward to the next person who stakes (or the people who caught the cheater)?

"ETH2.0 is not a “product” that will “launch” one day. As Vitalik described it, Ethereum will slowly morph into a different more advanced version with subtle improvements overtime.","For a certain period of time, ETH2.0 was part of the roadmap and was expected to “drop” or “launch” at a given date.

Somewhere along the way, this idea started changing and ETH2.0 became more of a concept rather than an actual product.

Ethereum will stay Ethereum but there will be subtle but important events and improvements along the way that combined will culminate in a more mature and advanced Ethereum over the years.

The main focus, as Vitalik stated, should be 2 things:

 • The move to PoS
 • Sharding

Any additional features act as accessories and polishing for the network to make it as idea as possible.

But for the meantime Vitalik is focusing mostly on Zk rollups as the future of salability for Ethereum.

It was back in 2020 when this decision to build around rollups came to fruition with Vitalik’s article titled “A roll-up-centric ethereum roadmap” where he described how Ethereum would be fully focused on rollups.

I think this is part of the reason why Vitalik is so supportive towards Polygon considering how much they’ve invested in rollups and scalability in general (Hermez, Polygon Zero, Polygon Avail, Polygon Edge).

So bottom line is, if you’re expecting a date of ETH2.0 to “launch” then dont cause its more of a combined process rather than an event launching.",706.0,2022-04-02 01:57:52,0.94

the Merge is coming! a few things to expect,"Sharing [this thread](https://twitter.com/trent_vanepps/status/1508478499325202435?s=20&t=RQzPSM9y-R56aF0lAhcILQ) of Merge info so the community can get acquainted with what to expect in a few months.

1. Unburnt fees (aka tips) on the execution layer (EL) begin going each block's proposer - completely liquid on the EL. Over a typical week, this is \~14k ETH / $42mm
2. Due to the amount of work required to properly test and verify the Merge across all clients, Beacon Chain validator withdrawals of staked ETH are only expected to be included in the upgrade after (Shanghai). Work from [@ralexstokes](https://twitter.com/ralexstokes) has started [here](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4895)
3. Post-merge, blocks will arrive exactly every 12s. Today, they arrive in a poisson distribution around \~13s. For devs: do not assume \~13s blocktimes (eg. to calculate an interest rate) - please make sure to use timestamps.  More [here](http://blog.ethereum.org/2021/11/29/how-the-merge-impacts-app-layer/) from [@TimBeiko](https://twitter.com/TimBeiko)
4. **The Merge/ Proof of Stake will not reduce fees on mainnet**. Smaller block/ slot times do increase available blockspace, but not significantly. Av. blockspace is only one input which influences fees, the other being demand. Near-term scaling & lower fees will be on Layer 2s!
5. To any stakers: you should start running a local execution layer (EL) client ahead of the Merge. In the future, outsourcing this to third-party providers will open up stakers to slashing risk under the [Proof of Custody game](https://dankradfeist.de/ethereum/2021/09/30/proofs-of-custody.html)
6. The Merge will use accumulated difficulty (Total Terminal Difficulty) to trigger the PoW→PoS upgrade, instead of block height ""An attacker cld use a minority of hash power to build a malicious chain fork that wld satisfy the block height req"". more [here](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-3675#terminal-total-difficulty-vs-block-number)
7. At the Merge, the 2 ETH PoW block reward goes away. new issuance will only come from PoS validators proposing blocks (\~.025 ETH) or ""attesting"" aka voting on network state (\~.00002 ETH)  4.3% PoW issuance → .43% in PoS h/t [@litocoen](https://twitter.com/litocoen). Higher security w/ lower spend!
8. Running a node post-Merge does not require any ETH (and never has). This is an important part of Ethereum culture that should be accessible to all. (Staking independently - aka consensus activities - does require 32 ETH. With some providers, it may be lower than 32.",437.0,2022-03-31 15:31:17,0.96
A question for the OG Ethereum people,"What was it like when Eth first came out? back when it was like 31 cents a coin? did people say it was gonna go to shit like they do with other cryptos that are growing now? Or were people sure it was a great idea off the bat? 

Is there any projects currently you get the same vibe from?

Loopring is currently my largest holding and I was wondering what the eth society thinks of it? I want an unbiased opinion really- i think its ridiculous when people say its gonna hit 100$ etc- like blatantly just hyping it up and hopium- but then i think eth went from 31cents to over 3k$ so is it even feasibly possible? the market cap would have to be like 130bil so i think its just mad cos ofc thats huge.

My main questions are how does the current climate of ceertain tokens match up with the original atmosphere of getting into eth? i understand crypto wasnt anywhere near as established back then but really its not that established now.",37.0,2022-03-31 15:14:38,0.84
"Anticipation for ETH 2.0 is at its highest now, and it creates an opening for eth related tokens","With Ethereum completing the final Kiln test onto the new chain, it seems the gates have been opened and everyone is ready for the upgrade, many reasons to be excited about this, but it’s important to note all the positive effects it will have on the other chains as well. 

You see, ETH doesn’t work on its own, and it wasn’t designed that way anyway. As we’ve seen in the past year, many other coins have grown dependent on ETH and have used its blockchain as part of their blockchain, notwithstanding all the positive effects it has had on the DeFi world. 

You see, if it wasn’t for the success of ETH, DeFi wouldn’t exist even. It basically launched it into the Ether, literally. 

DeFi is huge right now, and it has never been this big before. The whole world has come to understand that DeFi is a need and a must.

DeFi expands the use of blockchain from simple value transfer to more complex financial services. Specifically, DeFi refers to an ecosystem of decentralized applications – autonomous applications that operate using smart contracts instead of relying on an underlying company to manage them.

Apparently, as reported by CoinDesk, some DeFi platforms allow you to pay off student loans even, other platforms like Aloha DeFi function as a gateway into the DeFi space, with NFTs and DAOs within providing win win situations for everyone. A decentralized world that is just getting started but carries much potential. 

Right now, one of the largest sectors within, and the current news item of all mass media, is GameFi, as more and more game companies try to branch out with DeFi to expand the gaming industry.

DeFi’s value on Ethereum went from $1 billion to more than $100 billion in just 2 years. People are starting to take control of their own financials.,"I’m not trying to sound poetic here or anything but Ethereum is a financial revolution in the making and we’re all part of it.

This might be the first time in history where a regular person’s wealth isn’t governed by a central body that usually ends up giving back minimally and pocketing the rest.

This 100x growth in 2 years in unprecedented and that growth will only keep on increasing as we see more and more projects focusing on DeFi. Polygon alone announced $15 million allocated solely for DeFi development and liquidity mining on the chain. And we’re seeing a lot more Ethereum based projects starting to follow suit as well.

What’s crazy is that DeFi is only getting started. It’s what? 5 years old? That is NOTHING compared to other financial institutions that took decades and even centuries to see the similar growth that DeFi saw in a couple of years.

This might sounds like a reach right now, but if we keep up this pace financial institutions will slowly but surely start losing their grip around the populous’ necks.",117.0,2022-03-31 08:45:24,0.9

xToken Terminal: Deploy a Liquidity Mining Program on Uniswap V3 - no dev required!,"Uniswap, the most widely used DEX in DeFi, has brought a number of improvements with its V3 upgrade - namely, better capital efficiency via[ concentrated liquidity](https://docs.uniswap.org/protocol/concepts/V3-overview/concentrated-liquidity). But deploying a liquidity mining (LM) program on V3 right now requires technical expertise and development time - it typically requires 2-3 developer weeks.

How do we solve this? Enter,[ xToken Terminal](https://xtokenterminal.io/).

Terminal is a permissionless, no-code platform that allows projects to configure and deploy V3 LM programs in a few easy clicks - with a rich UI, a configurable contract architecture, and powerful features like rewards vesting and multi-token incentives. Terminal is great for LPs as well, allowing frictionless liquidity deployment and an end-to-end experience.

100% of fees collected from Terminal are redistributed to xToken (XTK) stakers. Single asset staking of XTK is available with a current APR of over 40%.

Why I think ZK tech is better than Optimistic tech.,"Regardless of the fact that ZK is significantly faster and more advanced than Optimistic rollups, ZK is focuses much more on privacy.

In my opinion privacy plays a huge role when it comes to this considering that these technologies are available on side chains and commit chains where privacy is always a concern.

This is exactly why I prefer commit chains like Polygon over others since they’ve been focusing a lot of ZK recently to the extent of allocating $1 billion just for ZK tech development and we’re already seeing that with new products like Polygon ID which basically proves access rights without having to prove any identity.

I love Ethereum and I genuinely think its the best blockchain out there since its proven time and time again to be the most reliable when it comes to to smart contracts. But the fact is that it’s plagued with traffic problems and most of us now need to resort to scaling solutions. And if I had to choose a scaling solution for the future of Ethereum ZK would definitely win out over Optimistic.",279.0,2022-03-30 06:11:48,0.92

What do you think of rollups as the L2 scaling solution for Ethereum?,"User activity on ETH has seen slow growth due to ETH’s high gas fees, not surprising, right? I noticed that plenty of users prefer to use Solana and Avalanche as gas fees on all of these chains cost less than a dollar. ETH has less throughput also in comparison to other Layer 1 blockchains.   
 

Various scaling solutions can help in boosting the growth of ETH's ecosystem. But what I've heard is that the rollups have shown the most potential as a scaling solution out of all of these. They can solve significant problems for ETH users, which are high gas fees and less throughput.   
 

I've noticed over time how rollups are enabling transactions at a low cost and have a high throughput capacity without compromising the security as settlement of all the transactions executed on rollups happens on ETH. ETH can act as a settlement layer of the ETH ecosystem while rollups are used as an execution layer.   
 

You know how processing is sluggish, optimistic rollups can boost scalability by up to 10-100x, depending on the transaction. With the advent of shard chains, this figure will rise even further, as more data will be available if a transaction is challenged. The two most widely used optimistic rollups are Optimism and Metis, which allows us to provide extraordinarily quick transactions that take only a few seconds and cost only a few cents while yet preserving ETH Layer 1 security.

Serious question: *Why* should crypto development be based on financial utopia if it isn't a necessary driver to technical success nor consumer adoption?,"The best entity for pragmatically increasing crypto usage worldwide is likely an analog to the best entity for increasing fiat currency usage worldwide, namely a bank or a bank-like entity. Banks as they exist today contain many undesirable features such as [insert your favourite here], which crypto is a good candidate to solve.

Yet, new generation digital banks that exist in certain markets do solve a significant portion of these issues and haven't so far necessarily required crypto to do so. For example, not having physical branches is a big advantage but one that is a business model concern, not a technical programming issue. Similarly, many of the other advantages also have to do with better management and organizational dynamics and economics, something again outside the scope of computer science. 

As a demonstration, consider generically the concept of customer service. I guarantee that you can list off the top of your head significantly more subjective aspects that would improve your experience with a contact center agent than you can list specific problems with IVR software. You wouldn't say that merely having a better coded database is a solution to lower morale or uncompetitive wages, right?

By the same token, why should crypto be treated as the be-all and end-all magic bullet for the system we have today? Do DeFi supporters genuinely believe the problem is as simple as making anything and everything decentralized and splashing some fairy dust on top?

It has already played a leading role in the emerging industry of decentralised finance (DeFi), as well as a platform for non-fungible tokens (NFTs).

"How does the subreddit feel about Polygon building multiple L2 solutions and moving away from being ""just a commit chain""?","Everyone knows that Polygon is currently just a commit chain and not a real layer 2. For some reason people either don't realize or outright ignore the fact that Polygon is building a whole suit of L2 chains. Polygon believes in an Ethereum centric world and the fact that they've put in 1B$ to build these ZK products on Ethereum proves this.

I think this multi-sided approach to ZK scaling on Ethereum is new and pretty interesting. They're aiming to do a whole ""internet of blockchains"" type thing and to my knowledge I do not think this has been done before.  Its products are designed to support the growth of Ethereum as the  network ramps up its user and application base. It’s worth noting,  Polygon’s particular focus on Ethereum reflects the company’s core  belief in the network as the center of the future cross-chain paradigm. 

At  present, blockchain scaling lacks a one-size-fit-all answer, meaning  each startup’s solution – be it Optimistic rollups, Zero Knowledge  rollups (ZK Rollups), or some other alternative – has a place in the  current ecosystem. This sort of competitive research effort is what  Mihailo Bjelic, co-founder of Polygon, has referred to in the past as  “letting one thousand flowers bloom.”

For anyone wondering. ZK Rollups are one of the two general categories of Layer-2 rollups,  alongside their peer, Optimistic rollups. At its core, the idea of ZK  Rollups relies on cryptographic proofs to verify changes to the network  state before they are bundled into the Ethereum blockchain. As a result,  some call ZK Rollups ‘validity proofs’. This stands in contrast to  Optimistic rollups, which “optimistically” assume all transactions are  correct and let verifiers on the mainnet check for fraudulent  transactions over some course of time. Optimistic rollups are also  referred to as ‘fraud proofs’.

I urge you to look into each of these individual chains on your own as there's too much info for one post honestly but in short. Hermez is placing a high focus on decentralization, Zero is focused on speed, Nightfall has a focus on Privacy for enterprises, while Miden is a STARK and Polygon avail is focusing on Data availability for Ethereum. Polygon edge is also made with developers in mind.

None of this is out there yet and I think Hermez is the closest to going live. \*IF\* all this goes well and they keep their promises then I believe this could be a massive step forward when it comes to scaling Ethereum.

Stuff /r/ethereum should know: Proof of Stake edition,"Poorly informed crypto-journalist articles are constantly coming out, and this brings more Proof-of-Stake related questions and discussions rehashing the same topics and same misconceptions. So here are a bunch of common questions/takes I see, boiled down in quick bullet points like I did in [my previous post](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/s8mnwb/a_collection_of_various_things_the_average/) that was more about Ethereum in general.

I plan on lazily linking this thread whenever I see those points being brought up, and I encourage everyone to do the same and correct me if I got anything wrong or suggest any addition.

## Wat merge?

A lot more info can be found on [ethmerge.com](https://ethmerge.com/) so I will keep this section light

* When the merge happens, Ethereum will be secured by Proof of Stake instead of Proof of Work.

* The Merge is not ""ETH 2.0"", there is no ETH 2.0, [it's an obsolete term.](https://blog.ethereum.org/2022/01/24/the-great-eth2-renaming/)

* **If you currently hold ETH, you don't need to do anything.** You will still hold the same amount of ETH after the merge, there is no ""ETH2 coin"", no need to migrate anything, etc. Everything sames exactly the same, only the consensus mechanism changes under the hood.

* It's called ""merge"" because it's about *merging* the Beacon Chain (*consensus layer*) with the current chain (*execution layer*) and ditching the proof of work part of the execution layer.

* If you don't know, ""consensus"" is just a fancy word for the goal of ordering transactions and getting some economic guarantee that this order won't change. Both PoW and PoS achieve consensus by different means:

  * PoW: ""It costs too much to mess up with the order of blocks, playing by the rules is more lucrative.""

  * PoS: ""It costs too much to mess up with the order of blocks, because if I do I'll lose all the money I put up as collateral.""

* Since it's only the consensus mechanism changing, **Proof of Stake by itself will not lower gas fees significantly**.

## Why merge?

* Lower security costs since there's less energy needed to achieve consensus.

  * For PoW you need miners to be able to *at least* cover all the hardware and energy they use otherwise no one will mine. This requires a big issuance that is quickly sold for fiat to pay the bills.
  
  * For PoS you just need to give some yield to stakers to make people want to deposit capital rather than just invest it elsewhere. No big bills to pay beyond an ordinary computer and an internet connection, so the yield just has to reflect the opportunity costs and risks involved.

* More sustainability:

  * The security of a blockchain is basically proportional to the value of its coin. This is true for both PoW (more valuable coin rewards = more reasons to play by the rules = more miners = harder to mess up the consensus) and PoS (more valuable staked coins = more reasons to play by the rules to avoid losing the staked coins)

  * A newly issued coin is essentially value being taken from all holders of the coin and being redistributed to someone. All else equal, selling that coin for fiat extracts value out of the network.

* It opens the door for many scaling solutions in the future, namely data sharding, statelessness, light clients, and [more](https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin/status/1466411377107558402)

* It helps reduce some complexity of the code going forward, by separating concerns between execution and consensus.

* Appeasing the environment and gamers is certainly a nice side-effect, but not really a major reason behind the switch to PoS, since it's mostly about externalities over which Ethereum as a protocol doesn't have much control (source of energy production, GPU supply chains, etc.)

## Wen merge?

* It happened on September 15th, 2022

## Nope, your a idiot. They will delay it like they always have in the past. They promised it years ago and still haven't delivered.

Believe or not this was a common talking point before the merge

## Those millions of ETH staked will crash the price the very moment they're unlocked LOL

For sure, there will be plenty of stakers who will want to finally take profit, especially those who locked their ETH back when 32 ETH was worth $10k. But there's plenty more to consider on the other side of the equation:

* The merge doesn't unlock any ETH. Withdrawals will come in the first hard fork following the merge, likely 6-8 months after. That's months of no proof of work issuance (~13k ETH/day) being sold off *and* no proof of stake issuance coming into circulation.

* Just like how there's a queue to deposit ETH, there will be [a queue to withdraw it.](https://github.com/ethereum/annotated-spec/blob/master/phase0/beacon-chain.md#how-does-eth2-proof-of-stake-work). Assuming a mass sell-off event, everyone is in that queue, limited at a rate of 1125 valitors per day. So there's no ""opening the floodgates"" moment. Everyone unstaking would literally take over a year. A year of ~38k ETH/day entering back into circulation (or... roughly 1% of average daily volume)

* After the merge, validators will start receiving fee rewards as well, doubling the yield [by some estimates](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1vrK5sY5ooq-F8dcyRhmmAJ5YtgkvWKWP3OfGCZIYxSA/edit#gid=0). There are thousands of people waiting in line to stake *right now*. They're okay with a 5% yield on their ETH, I don't think they're gonna yeet the moment it becomes 10% lol

* The biggest risk involved in staking is *by far* the merge. Something catastrophic could go wrong, yet people have been staking and locking up their ETH for over a year despite this risk and despite the ETH being locked until an unknown floating date. How many people/institutions are waiting on the sidelines for this risk to disappear before jumping in?

* And don't forget stakers exiting means fewer validators which means higher rewards for the stakers who don't exit. It also means more incentives for other people to *start* staking if they weren't before...

* But of course it's crypto, and crypto's gonna crypto. The merge will bring excitement and volatility and possibly a sell-the-news dip, who knows. I don't pretend to know the future, but the way I see it it's much more likely way more ETH will flow *into* staking than out of it.

## If proof of stake is so good, then how come Ethereum didn't go with that from the start?

* Proof of Work is easy to conceptualize and implement, Proof of Stake isn't. Especially when back in 2014 it was mostly a theoretical concept still being researched, with some blockchain implementing some version of it.

* There were several fundamental problems with PoS that needed to be overcome from a research perspective before thinking about implementing it. 

* There is no one-size-fits-all for Proof of Stake. Every PoS blockchain comes with its own PoS specification that has pros and cons on various aspects, so it's not as simple as ""but this other blockchain did it, why can't ethereum just do the same thing""

* Starting as a proof of work chain had the benefit of letting anyone mine coins on their own without anyone's permission, which helped the coin distribution become way better than those newer chains that are proof of stake from the start and have to decide how to allocate the initial coins, which can't really be done permissionlessly.

* Related to above: Yes, there was still a premine/presale for Ethereum, but it has now been diluted to half the supply after years of mining and multiple bull/bear cycles making that ETH swap hands, bringing the distribution [closer to Bitcoin's](https://medium.com/@adamscochran/the-10k-audit-42c100dd32bb). So it's not that big of a deal in 2022 when Ether as an asset is extremely liquid and easy to acquire. 

## Nah, this is really just a ploy to screw over the miners one last time after years of hard work

* PoS has been the eventual goal since [day 1](https://blog.ethereum.org/2014/07/22/launching-the-ether-sale/), everyone mining was always aware that it would end one day. There is no rugpull or unfairness going on here.

* Economic factors trump any kind of miner-blockchain loyalty. You can kinda view the blockchain as a business and the miners as employees:

  * Miners/employees have been paid for the service they provide (namely, secure consensus) with the block rewards. The paycheck is an expense for the employer and it comes from diluting the value of existing coins from holders (see above in ""why merge?"")

  * Miners go to the chain offering the highest rewards, most of them would ditch Ethereum in a heartbeat if another GPU minable coin gave out more rewards. 

  * Similarly, Ethereum will pay less for the service it requires if stakers can do it for way cheaper. 

* It's not entirely exclusive. Miners can also be holders of the coin, and users of the blockchain. Nothing prevents them from holding their rewards and becoming stakers too.

## The coin stops having inherent value if you're not spending real world energy to mine it

I don't really buy this argument. There is nothing magical about computing hashes over and over until you land on one that fits arbitrary requirements. I mean, you could have a proof of work blockchain where the work is done by solving sudoku puzzles and it would work exactly the same: NP-complete problem, hard to compute one way but easy to verify a solution once one has been found. That doesn't mean solving sudoku inherently brings value into the world. Cranking up the mining difficulty of a coin doesn't magically make everyone richer, it just makes mining less profitable – unless of course demand goes up too, which so far hasn't been too much of a problem in the crypto world.

The way I see it, the value of a coin ultimately comes from supply and demand, and the demand comes from how valuable the blockspace is. People need ETH to buy the blockspace, regardless of whether that ETH is generated by a miner or a staker. Sure, the more miners there are the higher the security/decentralization which further increases the value proposition of the blockspace in a positive feedback loop, but [feedback loops exist in Proof of Stake Ethereum too](https://i.imgur.com/3bPV35a.png) and they're super cool too!

## Proof of Stake is a recipe for total centralization

* It's basically the same as Proof of Work but slightly different. ""Better"" or ""worse"" really depends on your opinion. The way I see it, PoW is really just PoS with extra steps.

* Ethereum as a community values decentralization highly, any potential centralization vector is addressed by the research team to come up with ways to mitigate it, even if it's at the cost of other important stuff like scaling (e.g. keeping gas limits low so more nodes can participate in decentralization, even if that results in congestion and high fees)

* There **are** shortcomings currently, decentralization is a spectrum and a process and we're not there yet, and for the time being there are many centralization crutches that need to go away on the long term. That said, none of these crutches represent existential risks for the network, and for practically any ""it's centralized because X"" statement, there is an item on [the roadmap](https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin/status/1466411377107558402) addressing X. I personally find it much more fascinating to come up with a whole bunch of stuff to solve X rather than give up and say ""it can't be done because of X"". 

* Something interesting about Ethereum's PoS design that is often overlooked: Quadratic penalties. A single validator going down, messing up, or downright attacking the network doesn't get penalized very badly. A thousand validators doing it at the same time get penalized much more heavily. 

  * This means that if you're a megawhale with thousands of validators, it's in your own best interest to spread them out, avoid cloud hosting, use different clients, etc. Sure, the capital is still concentrated, but at least the points of failures are distributed which is good for the health of the network overall.

  * Compared to a big mining operation that relies on a central location to amortize costs, which can be spotted from energy usage and shut down if the authorities don't like it. It's hard to move mining equipment across the world, but staking only relies on private/public keys and not any actual hardware beyond a consumer grade computer.

## PoS is really just ""who has money makes more money""

* Yes. Unfortunately we live in a world of high wealth inequality. Blockchains don't fix that. 

* It's also true of proof of work: Whoever has money can buy more mining rigs and make more money. Except with mining, the ROI becomes better with economies of scale: Centralized mining operations have the big bucks to get bulk/discount rates on hardware and move to the places with cheap electricity. The solo miner simply can't realistically compete. With Proof of Stake, everyone earns the same yield proportionally, where they stake $10 or $10M.

* ""*They may be centralized, but those big mining operations have no reason to attack the network and weaken it since they dumped millions in infrastructure*""....... so you're saying you're fine with big centralized actors existing, as long as they have some kind of a big *stake* in the network?

## Passive interest on your deposit though? Printing money out of thin air? That's literally central banks and fiat part 2 electric boogaloo

* You have to really stretch it to make this case, but I've seen people do that lol. Those takes usually begin with ""proof of stake is nothing new""

* There's still ""work"" being done by validators: creating blocks and validating other blocks. It's just that the work done is composed entirely of the *actually useful work* that the blockchain needs to reach consensus, instead of computing hashes over and over again until one of them meets an arbitrary requirement. 

* It's not really ""free money being printed out of thin air"", there are still costs involved in staking capital, they're just more abstract and less direct than energy bills:

  * Opportunity costs – Why stake at all if another investment offers you a better yield?

  * Illiquidity – From the moment you deposit, your capital is locked up, queued up until your validator is active, then when you withdraw there is yet another queue before getting it back.

  * Inherent risks – It's still a fairly new thing, something could go wrong, there could be a critical bug, network could get attacked, your staking hardware could get compromised, etc.

  * Volatility – at the end of the day it's still a volatile asset, if you're the kind of investor who denominates their investments in their country's fiat currency, then a 5% yield on an asset that can drop 30% overnight isn't all that great (the upside of 5% yield on an asset that doubles is pretty great though, turn that 100% gain into 110%)

  * Maintenance – You still have to maintain and secure your validator, ensure 100% uptime, update software, etc. 

* Here's where it gets nifty: The more stakers there are, the lower the individual rewards get. This basically means that all those costs above will get priced by the market itself. It's easy to see why: If the staking yield is too low, then the rewards don't justify the costs and people will pull out and invest elsewhere, bringing the yield back up. Likewise if it's too high, that'll attract more capital and bring it back down. 

* As far as inflation goes: Let's say the market as a whole decides that 5% is the ideal yield, of which 3% comes from issuance. That works out to about 30 million ETH staked printing 900 thousand new ETH per year. At a total supply of 120 million ETH, that's an inflation rate of 0.75%. Which is outpaced by EIP1559 burn as long as gas fees are at least 23 gwei. (I cannot stress this enough: *Ether-the-asset will become a yield-bearing deflationary asset very soon*)

* ""*Nice math but there's no supply cap + they change the monetary policy all the time*"" 

  * The goal has been ""minimum viable issuance to secure the network"" for years, priorizing network security over an arbitrary supply cap.
  
  * No update to the monetary policy has ever increased supply inflation. Low inflation rate (specifically *dis*inflation) has been the goal since day 1.

  * There will be an equilibrium acting as an effective supply cap – decided again by market forces valuing Ethereum's blockspace – once the rate of EIP1559 burn matches the rate of issuance. That's super nifty if you ask me.

* So yeah, there's no ""central Ethereum bank"" adjusting rates arbitrarily and printing money to cronies. The market itself dictates how much inflation/deflation there is, no single entity can control it the way a central bank controls fiat inflation rates.

## Whales have all the money needed to take over and change the rules and slash honest stakers

* No. Ethereum has no on-chain governance of any kind for this reason. Protocol updates are a community effort (*Layer 0*) and you don't need any money staked to call out bad ideas and participate in the process.

* This is exactly the same as Proof of Work: Even if you have 99% of the hashpower, you can't make invalid transactions that steal people's money without their private keys, or change protocol rules, or really do anything beyond reorganizing blocks. The 1% of honest nodes will reject any block that don't follow the rules and you'll be mining on an invalid/useless chain. Now replace hashpower/mining with stake/staking and the same holds true for Proof of Stake (with the difference that someone caught reorganizing blocks will have their entire stake destroyed, whereas the blockchain can't exactly destroy mining rigs)

* And simply put, there is a fuckton of ETH involved. 10 million and counting and that's *before the merge*. At current prices that's roughly 30 billion dollars. Both ""amount of ETH staked"" and ""value of ETH"" are projected to go up, so attacks become increasingly unlikely due to the sheer economic cost involved in doing an attack — *once* — and the absurdity of acquiring that much ETH in the first place if the attack comes from an outside actor (where would you buy 10 million ETH to have 51% of the stake? 20M?)

## 32 ETH is way too much, the average person doesn't have that much

* I agree it's a lot. There are some ideas of how it could be lowered ([better signature aggregation](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/rwojtk/ama_we_are_the_efs_research_team_pt_7_07_january/hrmt6o0/) or [a rotating cap of active validators](https://ethresear.ch/t/simplified-active-validator-cap-and-rotation-proposal/9022)) but they don't seem to be very high on the priority list currently, as opposed to making sure the base layer is truly secure.

* The reason for such a high number is it has to fall in a technical sweetspot. In a nutshell, it has to be low enough to be accessible and have enough validators to secure the chain, but high enough to not have too many validators and bloat the chain with overhead. And having a fixed amount for each validator reduces a lot of the complexity by having each validator weighted exactly the same in the distributed randomness process of who gets to produce each block.

* There is a whole bunch of [math involved](https://thomasborgers.medium.com/ethereum-2-0-economic-review-1fc4a9b8c2d9) to arrive at 32 ETH from a technical standpoint, back when 32 ETH was worth about 7000 USD. [Earlier math from 2017](https://medium.com/@VitalikButerin/parametrizing-casper-the-decentralization-finality-time-overhead-tradeoff-3f2011672735) even suggested over 1000 ETH minimum. 

* Thankfully, just like mining pools exist, there are staking pools to allow staking in smaller amounts. It doesn't necessarily fly in the face of the ""not your keys not your coins"" mantra, thanks to things like [RocketPool](https://rocketpool.net/), [Secret Shared Validators](https://medium.com/coinmonks/secret-shared-validators-on-ethereum-2-0-ea29ab380016) (not yet launched) which use smart contracts to be permissionless, decentralized and non-custodian. And because of the quadratic penalties mentioned above, I believe decentralized staking operations will outperform the centralized ones on the long run. I recommend superphiz's [guide to staking](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethstaker/comments/t1xpr5/how_to_stake_on_ethereum_march_2022_edition/) for more info. And obviously, I admit staking through exchanges is yucky if you value decentralization

* Related to above, stuff like Rocket Pool is better viewed as a higher-level abstraction to base staking, rather than ""just a staking pool"". I go into more details on this [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/tijcq1/stuff_rethereum_should_know_proof_of_stake_edition/i1gd27b/?context=1) for those interested.

## PoS hasn't been proven, while we know PoW works

That's actually totally fair and there is no real rebuttal to this, obviously. Only time will tell. I just think it's irrelevant in the context that Ethereum *is* switching to PoS and was always going to. If you don't believe in it, don't participate/invest in it. I do personally believe in a long term sustainable PoS Ethereum, but even then I'm glad good ol' boring-by-design Bitcoin will be there chugging its proof of work along.

It's all part of the great crypto experiment of our lifetime. Either it's just a fad and will fail into obscurity, which would be a bummer for sure, or we'll have succeeded in creating monster robust networks capable of outlasting humanity. To achieve that, prioritizing decentralization is key. Which is something I mainly just see in Bitcoin and Ethereum, despite the widely different philosophies. It's why I'm glad to have both to truly see what's what on the long term.

Effect if L2 chains on ETH 2.0 and future pricing,"I am trying to understand the pricing scenario for Ethereum on the long run.

Would the functionality of NFTs be beneficial to stock media creators?," The majority of stock media platforms charge commission fees ranging from 60 to 85 percent, leaving content creators with low earnings. With the low revenues they are receiving, they don't have a choice but to sell them at a higher price which affects consumers as well.

ETH Vs BTC security model," 

BTC currently trades around $40k and with miner earnings coming 99% from inflation and 1% from transaction fees. Within 10 years, BTC will undergo 3 more halvings. So by 2032, at least one of the following must happen:

1. The price per bitcoin is $320K
2. The hash power and network security is way down.
3. Miners are mining at a loss (perhaps as a public service?)
4. People are paying 100x more fees to use bitcoin.
5. The 21 million hard cap is abandoned.

2-5 will stay regardless, but if we extend out a little farther the price must be $640K (2036), $1.28M (2040), $2.56M (2044), $5.12M (2048), 10.24M (2056) to pay for the same level of security.

While BTC price has more than doubled at each halving so far, I think items 2-5, or some combination thereof, are more likely in the medium term.

It really makes you appreciate ETH's sustainable security budget - constant inflation to pay stakers, burn based on usage.",79.0,2022-03-16 22:58:15,0.85

Utility is mainly why I feel like Ethereum will eventually be king, I don't feel like any other rival L1s will be able to compete with it either. Regardless, I am quite open to everyone's thoughts and I'm always looking to learn more.",59.0,2022-03-14 16:08:43,0.78

**Frequently Asked Questions**

**Where's the best place to buy ETH?**

There are many centralized exchanges that support Ethereum. If you live in the US, the most popular exchanges are Coinbase, Gemeni and Kraken. Coinbase users can use Coinbase Pro for lower fees.

**When is Eth2 launching?**

Eth2 is a marketing term used to represent a number of updates to Ethereum. The Eth2 proof-of-stake chain first launched in December 2020. ""The Merge"", which is the event that will fully switch Ethereum's consensus to proof-of-stake, is estimated to be ready in early 2022, although there is no exact timeline. Other updates, such as data shards, will follow that update.

Visit [ethmerge.com](https://ethmerge.com/) to learn more about ""The Merge"".

**Do I need to do anything to update to Eth2? Will Eth2 create a new token?**

No, ETH holders *never* need to take any action to keep holding ETH. Ethereum users will be unaffected by the Eth2 upgrade. And the Eth2 updates will not create any new tokens.

**How can I stake my ETH?**

There are two ways that you can stake your ETH: by running your own validator, or providing your ETH to a staking pool.

* Running your own validator requires a modern computer and 32 ETH. Visit /r/ethstaker for more details
* Staking pools accept any amount of ETH. We recommend [Lido](https://lido.fi/) or [StakeWise](https://stakewise.io/)

**Why are Ethereum transaction fees so high?**

Like most blockchains, Ethereum fees are determined by supply-and-demand. The large demand to use Ethereum has pushed transaction fees quite high (however, fees were just a few cents only 2 years ago). Fees are especially high during market volatility, and during NFT drops.

**What is being done to lower Ethereum transaction fees?**

Ethereum fees are reduced by using layer-2 rollups. Rollups are scaling solutions that allow for significantly cheaper transactions, while still maintaining Ethereum's security.

Additionally, Eth2's data shards will make rollups even cheaper.

While rollups are cutting-edge technology being actively developed, a number are already live on Ethereum mainnet. Visit [l2beat.com](https://l2beat.com/) to learn more about rollups.

**What's the best wallet for Ethereum?**

The most popular tool for using decentralized applications is Metamask. However, for security reasons, we recommend using a hardware wallet such as a Trezor or Ledger.

How did migration from PoW to PoS happen mechanically?,"Hey all. Mined Eth a bit in college. Digging into crypto a little deeper now a little later in life. I've read a lot about the pros and cons of PoW vs PoS and I'm not looking to start a discussion on that here.

What I'm curious about is mechanically HOW that migration happened (or will happen). I found a report from a few years back that estimated 25,000 full eth nodes, I imagine there are a considerable number of miners outside of the major pools (may be wrong about that?). Can someone explain or link an article as to how the whole network of nodes and miners got updated to a new work model? Is Eth 2.0 going to be a separate currency? What happened/will happen to miners/nodes that failed to upgrade? Who decided to do the upgrade? Is it possible that, if enough of the community decided didn't ""buy in"" to the change of model, the movement from PoW to PoS wouldn't have happened?

Thanks in advance!",24.0,2022-03-14 05:20:19,0.85
CBDCs,"So I realize people don't quite grasp the full story on the CBDC thing. What I see now is what I imagine an intelligent op based, or Neocon based attempt to use CBDCs as a red herring to distract you from the greater danger to crypto. This greater danger is legislation and CipherTrace/TRM surveillance.

&#x200B;

First off you need to understand 6050i recently added in the infrastructure. You're going to need to do some googling, but the TLDR is forcing KYC on developers who make DeFi, putting felonies on them, if they don't collect it from DeFi users.

&#x200B;

There are simply going to be more variations of the same law repeatedly put onto the books.

&#x200B;

What is happening, is the american regime is using all of this as a future pretext to unperson and deplatform people and essentially bypass the 1st amendment through fascist collusion with tech monopolies, and extreme surveillance based on blockchain data.

&#x200B;

But this is entirely impossible in a cash based society. The goal of all of this is to fundamentally get rid of the censorship resistance and cross border nature of crypto, so that it a) can't fundamentally challenge boomer capitalism

&#x200B;

b) can't facilitate cash like payments

&#x200B;

The current war situation is the most intel-psyop ridden propaganda action the West has likely ever done. Duck Duck Go and Google and Youtube are mass purging people, many who were quite left wing, like abby martin.

&#x200B;

all of this after Trudeau, after they turned Russia off with the flip of a switch.

&#x200B;

So how are they going to do this in the future.

&#x200B;

Not CBDC's, but rather mandated KYC sidechains, and mandated wallets, and wallet protocols like aopp. They will fundamentally strangle this industry with narcware wallets, front ends, and backdoors on software and hardware wallets that comply with Fatf. Fatf is a euphemism for a cashless society.

&#x200B;

If you comply with these forms of legislation, and allow KYC to be normalized, you will lose what fundamentally makes crypto crypto. Once they can politically unperson people for nationality and identity, Web3 is no longer Web3, it's no longer international, permissionless, and disintermediated.

&#x200B;

What I'm implying, is that you will not be able to buy anything from a shop without a KYC'd wallet, you will not be able to pay bills, cash out, 0 cash like behavior, no ability to live. Because of CipherTrace and Chain analysis and these mandated sidechains/mandated wallets that are travel rule compliant. They're recreating banks on the blockchain so they can unperson you later. Frankly, they want you to do KYC even to get on the internet, ideally they would like to freeze your bank account, your crypto wallet, and kick you off the internet. The did it in Canada, they're doing it in Russia, Russia is doing it to its own people too in addition to what we did to Russia, they do it to gun sellers, 3d part kits, SWer. You need to learn about Operation Chokepoint, as a legal loophole for this. Facebook and Youtube are extensions of the Defense Department and these Neocon/Neolib outfits.",25.0,2022-03-13 23:05:26,0.78
Ethereum vs Bitcoin security,"Hey guys

How will transition to PoS affect security? I know it is more energy-efficient but is it at the sacrifice of securtity? What are the pros and cons.

I was looking to stake my ETH and I've been recommended Rocketpool to do so.

But seriously, don't spend your hard earned crypto on shitty pictures that someone drew in a few hours. Most peole artificially inflate the price of these NFT's by just buying their own.

Most likely a lot of NFT project creators will just ghost their own project, maybe even the networks hosting your images linked to the metadata that make up the NFT will be gone.

Can we Stop the MetaMask/Venezuela nonsense?,"Sorry for the rant but:

Guys please use your brains…

If you use a bitcoin light wallet the same thing can happen as you are relying on a centralized node service to connect to the network that can block your ip from connecting to it if desired.

Metamask can’t block shit, it’s the node service infura that comes as default node setting which is a Organisation that can be politically pressured to block you out…

That’s something ALL light clients have in common by design, no matter the blockchain.

Easy way to avoid: spend 30 seconds to change metamask settings to a different node service or even better, run your own node and connect your wallet to it. (Same for bitcoin).

NOBODY can stop you connecting to the network via metamask.

6 Red Flags to Avoid When Investing in NFT-s,"# TOP 6 Major Red Flags in NFT Projects

**When you enter the NFT market as a newcomer, you will most likely encounter many NFT projects that sound almost too good to be true. It does not matter whether you have close to zero or years of experience, people still tend to ignore these easy to remember red flags to separate promising NFT projects from the shady ones. To ensure that you don’t make these massive mistakes by getting into a suspicious NFT project, we gathered TOP 6 red flags to not ignore by any means.**  


Or watch a 3 minute video instead [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t99EJu\_7GAQ&t=8s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t99EJu_7GAQ&t=8s)

# 1. Undoxxed team

**If you look at the project’s website and it does not have links to real Instagram, Twitter, or LinkedIn accounts, do not buy the NFT to prevent the possibility of getting scammed.**

**A doxed team, regardless of skillset or background, adds a layer of trust that there are real people building real projects.**

**Recommendation: Question their discord as to why there is no personal information included. If they cannot provide an answer as to why that satisfies your standards, stay away.**

# 2. Fake Twitter or Discord followers/accounts

**There are plenty of sources that will chat on behalf of the team on their Discord server. For example, Fiverr provides a message every min per hour just for $20. Different websites such as GetViral sell Twitter followers for almost no money that will create an illusion of a reliable following.**

**Recommendation: Do a quick audit, for instance use TwitterAudit. Look through engagement on posts to see if there are any real people or just bots. If the account has 120k followers and only 50 likes, it is a red flag. Also check if any notable people follow the account.**

# 3. Artificial hype

**Most shady NFT projects often purchase celebrity endorsements to generate unrealistic publicity around the project. Big names in the field of entertainment such as Thiago Silva can be hired for a silly amount of money to gain people’s attention in the sketchy project.**

**Recommendation: It is highly recommended to do some research. Dig into whether the partnerships are officially approved or just paid “partnerships”.**

# 4. Unrealistic mint price

**Hype-based pricing is certainly a real problem in the NFT space. The golden rule to identify a suspicious NFT project is to analyse the mint price. Behind a high mint price there is almost always the combination of hype and FOMO which drives the price unrealistically high. Many projects have nothing of substance to back their price and rely solely on “influencers” to boost the price. This results in investing money into those projects because of FOMO and losing everything when the hype dies.**

**Real community builders start the mint price at a reasonable level and do not extract all the liquidity out of the market. Just because the NFT project can demand a high price does not mean they should.**

**Recommendation: A project that allows the original minters to participate in an affordable way is what builds loyal supporters of the project to stick through the storm and lulls. As an opposite, projects that mint at ridiculously high prices often have difficulty finding support during tough times. Therefore, it is important to invest in projects you truly believe in.**

# 5. Predatory tactics

**Floor sweeps: Sweeping the floor in the NFT world means when a specific project buys all its minted NFTS at the floor price. The floor price is the minimum “ask” or the lowest price an NFT can be sold on the secondary market. It is the most popular metric for tracking a project’s performance over time and its relative success compared to others. As an emerging project, floor sweeping can be a method to attract newcomers by guaranteeing low entry points.**

**Banning members: Another predatory tactic to look out for is banning members for listing below prices. This means a member of the project is being kicked out of the community for selling their NFT at a much lower price than the fishy owners of the projects approve.**

**Echo chamber: A big red flag is the existence of an echo chamber. It is an environment where a person only encounters information or opinions that reflect and reinforce their own. This may limit the information the users consume and promote ideas relevant to the NFT project.**

**Recommendation: Step out of the chamber (Discord, forums etc) for a few days. This often allows for the head to clear so better judgement can be made.**

**Other popular red flags to watch out for are harassments of any kind, threats and piggybacking of popular projects.**

# 6. Meta cliché

**If the project fails to bring more than little innovation by introducing repetitive meta or roadmaps, be cautious. This can be an alarming indicator that the project is most likely going to take advantage of your money to cover its own interests. In addition, if the project fails to address legality concerns over securities and insurance of tokens, consider exiting the project.**

**Meta is easy to copy, and tokens can be launched only in a matter or hours. On the contrary, real economies take months or years to create.**

**The lack of ability to create proper Tokenomics or P2E for sustainability and longevity is also a worrying measure. For instance, the owners of the Bored Ape Yacht Club can participate in exclusive clubs and areas of the BAYC. This is a good way of thinking in the future and gaining people’s trust.**

**Tokenomics: The goal of a Tokenomic analysis is to understand the potential value of the project by considering all aspects of a token’s creation and management, including its supply, allocation, and distribution. The reason why Tokenomics is so important is that it helps to ascertain the future worth of an asset by giving an insight into the profitability of one asset over the other in the future.**

**P2E (Play to Earn): indicates a type of gaming that hinges on NFT technologies. For example, gamers can play video games and virtual worlds for rewards by making an initial investment in the NFT.**

**Identifying these red flags may be a long arduous journey of separating the real NFT projects from the quick cash-grabs, but once you understand the importance of it, success is guaranteed. Unfortunately, there are no blueprints to follow in this new industry, which means there are no right or wrong ways to approach a project.**

**Start by looking for niches and teams with the ability to execute. Find out who is the founding team, and how they work, what their values and grand vision are. If they show lack in respect, transparency, or communication, consider moving on.**",100.0,2022-03-02 13:58:15,0.82

"UNI V3 simplified, let xToken Terminal be your guide........","  


Hello r/ethereum! I’m Chad, Community Manager from xToken. 

In this post, I’d like to introduce xToken, outline the capabilities of our soon-to-launch platform xToken Terminal, and lay out the business case for using Terminal’s Liquidity Mining app.

**About xToken** 

Since we launched in July 2020, we've served thousands of DeFi users with our native staking and liquidity strategies, processing over $300 million in primary volume across our funds and peaking at $150 million in TVL. Given our deep expertise with Uniswap V3 strategies and unique experience working with other DeFi projects, we’ve transitioned to building DeFi infrastructure to simplify financial primitives.

Our new platform, xToken Terminal, aims to be the most trusted and robust capital markets and liquidity management platform for Web3. We want to provide DeFi projects with seamless access to fundamental on-chain primitives. Mining, the first app deployed on Terminal, allows a project to deploy and configure a customized Uniswap V3 liquidity mining campaign in a few easy clicks — freeing up valuable development resources while providing an enhanced user experience, added configurability, and augmented security.

**Why Should I Incentivize Liquidity on V3?**

Uniswap V3 is a step-function improvement in the AMM space, offering better capital efficiency for liquidity providers, improved execution for traders, and a more powerful launchpad for DeFi infrastructure. We believe that liquidity will continue to migrate from V2 (and elsewhere) and that V3 will cement itself as the preeminent DEX.

For DeFi projects and DAO’s alike, maintaining a strong liquidity presence on Uniswap V3 enhances community access to your token(s), while helping to promote discoverability and connectedness with the rest of the Web3 ecosystem. 

**The Problem with Current V3 Liquidity Mining Solutions**

Unlike V2, integrating with the Uniswap V3 contracts requires significant development expertise. Projects pursuing LM on Uni V3 spend precious resources developing custom contracts or writing complex off-chain scripts – time that could be used to develop the core product offering. 

While there are a few active solutions currently being used in the ecosystem, we believe there should be a complete, end-to-end solution with customizable features, top-notch UX and an emphasis on trustlessness and discoverability.

**The Terminal Difference**

With Terminal’s Mining app, xToken has built an integrated, configurable architecture that allows partners to permissionlessly configure and deploy V3 liquidity mining programs in a few easy clicks.

What makes Mining the best solution for Uni V3 LM?

* Ease of use for pool sponsors: 
   * DeFi projects can deploy and configure a highly customized LM program via the intuitive Terminal UI in a matter of minutes
* Ease of use and end-to-end experience for LPs
   * Users deposit liquidity through the Terminal UI and are immediately earning rewards. No need to engage with multiple UIs or deposit LP tokens to external staking rewards contracts
* Full feature set
   * Sponsors can customize their programs with any Uni V3 price range, multiple rewards tokens and an optional vesting period on rewards
   * The data-rich Terminal UI provides useful pool data for both sponsors and LPs
* Enhanced security
   * Our contracts have been audited by ABDK and CertiK and we’ve launched an ImmuneFi Bug Bounty program.
* Low fees
   * We charge a small one-time pool deployment fee and a 1% fee on distributed rewards. All fees from rewards are paid back to $XTK stakers.
* Discoverability
   * All deployed Mining pools will be viewable on the Terminal app, providing a new way for DeFi users to discover your community

Why aren’t crypto wallets called keychains instead?,"It makes more sense to call them keychains as they arent really wallets. You store money in a wallet, you dont store crypto in your crypto wallet. Crypto wallets basically are keychains as they literally hold your private KEYS and gives you acxes to your assets on the blockchain. Lots of new people are confused wether or not your crypto is stored in your wallet because of the naming. Naming it crypto keychain would eliminate that confusion. Is it still too late to change the naming? Id love to hear opinions!",143.0,2022-03-01 12:10:55,0.92
Is there anyway to reject a transaction to my public wallet?," 

Let's say I am an executive of a big company and someone tries to bribe me for some business interest.

If this person tries to send me a huge amount of ETHs to my public wallet address, is there anyway to reject the transaction?

In other words, is there an approval process for the incoming transactions?

Could Blockchain/Ethereum offer more verifiable & free elections for democracies?,"I'm thinking about Russia, but this goes beyond that.  Conceptually, does Blockchain have potential for better systems for elections?  By verifiable I mean that voters and auditors can confirm the integrity of votes cast, and by free I mean still anonymous.   Non-fungible ballots with verifiable but anonymous ownership, and transparent election results read out from a ledger?  Key encryption?

Obviously there are more problems in the integrity of elections beyond the choice of digital infrastructure (oppressive regimes would not adopt a transparent system, for one).  But if somehow a verifiable-integrity system could be proven, there may be pressure to adopt it.

Announcement: Flexpool.io is halting all service to Russia," As  everyone has heard, Russia has launched a surprise invasion of Ukraine.  The world is again faced with war, which could signal the next and  possibly final war. This may be the biggest war since WW2, bigger than  any of us, and goes beyond politics or nationality. This is a war at a  time of peace when we are busy dealing with and recovering from the  COVID-19 crisis. People are dying, and the world is guessing whether the  West will join in or watch Ukraine fall to Putin's ambitions.

We  generally do not get involved in politics despite our personal views as  a company. However, this is greater than politics, greater than anyone.  This is a war that may end the world. It certainly is ending the lives  of many innocent people in Eastern Europe. While there is little we can  do, it would be wrong to profit off of it or fund it indirectly. We are  canceling service to all Russian IPs and paying out outstanding  balances.

We apologize to our  Russian miners; many of you do not support the war. However, it is you  who are supporting your nation. Without the people, Russia cannot  operate. It is only through reducing the economic power of its people  that we have a chance of affecting this war. We thank you for your  loyalty, and I hope you understand that we do not make this decision  lightly. Should this situation be resolved peacefully, we will happily  welcome back all Russian miners and use our personal funds to make it up  to you.

If you are in Ukraine and  reading this now, know that the world is with you.  We can't change the  situation ourselves. We call on other companies and people around the  world to join us and make a difference together. This isn't about  politics; this is about preventing the end of the world and saving  lives. Companies and people need to put the planet over profits in the  modern era. Ukraine has four nuclear power plants. Even ignoring the  chance of WW3, there is a chance of another Chernobyl should one of the  plants be endangered. The Fukushima nuclear disaster in Japan happened  despite the plant having been forewarned so that they were shut down and  built to withstand an earthquake. Everyone in Europe, Russia, and the  Middle East are in danger of nuclear fallout should the worst happen.  Notice that the world will only end not because people do something but  because people know yet choose to do nothing.",505.0,2022-02-24 18:33:07,0.86
The [REDACTED] ETHDenver 2022 Report,"The outlet for whom this article was intended got cold feet about running it, so here's my report on ETHDenver 2022...

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

The first ETHDenver was in 2018, deep in bear market doldrums. Hopium was lost. There was a whiff of vapor in the ware. Rumor has it that ETHDenver programming that year was just Gitcoin founder Kevin Owocki in a rented bufficorn costume offering bounties for free hugs to an empty auditorium. Even in those salad days of free-wheeling pre-COVID physical contact, few people accepted. Oh, how things have changed.

After surviving an existentially challenging bear market and a near apocalyptic pandemic only to emerge stronger than ever, the mood amongst ETHNerds at ETHDenver 2022 was buoyant, only a gentle caress short of euphoric. Over 20,000 applicants for an event that could comfortably have accommodated a tenth of that meant this year was always going to be an unprecedented clusterfuck. That sense of euphoria lasted only until attendees encountered the line to get in. ETHDenver’s (ostensibly noble) COVID test upon entry policy meant a three hour wait to get in as the line snaked down the block, across the street, and almost into adjacent time zones — all caked in a post-snowstorm slurry. And wait they did, in droves, and for days on end.  

That kind of excitement can only mean one thing. Lines for a COVID test. Lines for the elevator. Lines to get into talks. Lines for the bathroom. Lines *in* the bathroom. Crypto has two modes: Apocalypse and utopia. ETHDenver was firmly the latter. Self-flagellation is out. Self-congratulation is in. That’s because Web3 and DeFi and NFTs and DAOs have all achieved mainstream buzzword status, and none of those exists without Ethereum. You can tip people with ETH on Twitter. Fucky Zucky thought hijacking the metaverse could save his sinking ship. He must be sniffing metamine. Shit, Even Melania Trump bought her own NFT. And if Trump Org is grifting in your backyard, there’s gold in them hills. It’s a whole different kind of gold rush out here in Denver. 

The thing is that Ethereum tech actually works now. Well, sorta. It may cost $73 and take a few hours, but if you want to spend $23 million on a jpeg of a monkey – that utopian reality is yours for the making. Do you want to loan a derivative of a derivative of a derivative of a dog-themed meme coin? Sure! Just please don’t call it a derivative or the SEC will sue everyone. APY? In this economy?! Fuck that. What’s your yield by the *nanosecond*? Imagine your favorite, most esoteric MMORPG, but with the graphics of a 16-bit Animal Crossing. Sounds not bad, right? Now imagine it with a JPMorgan Lounge. That’s Metaverse, baby!   

At any crypto event, you’re gonna hear a heap of new lingo: Ponzinomics, POAP, danksharding, pussyverse, proto-shard data-blobs. Did you know that play-to-earn can solve poverty? That must have something to do with the Doge-wrapped McLaren parked in front of the Art Hotel. It was gone by day 3, so here’s hoping that someone vandalized it. 

It’s 4pm on a weekday in the Castle, in a cavernous side room shrouded in fog and laden with the rolling thud of house music. Countless exhausted future Bufficorns lay supine in beanbag chairs, staring at the canopy of lasers above them weaving cerulean and lavender spears. Excited groups of kids share shots of liquor. A one man dance party shuffles alone in the center of the room until a gaggle of girls bound into the space and join him. Is this a tech conference or a music festival? 

This could be the year that ETHDenver became SXSW for Crypto. It looks like the NFT gold rush has blown the space wide open culturally. The cool kids have arrived, and en masse. You can spot them because they share the same fashion aesthetic as a bored ape: animal prints, goofy sunglasses, glittering sequins, thousand yard stare. It’s too much for some, mostly the jaded blockchain marketing vets standing confused on the outskirts of all things, wondering how they haven’t downloaded Metamask mobile yet despite working in crypto for a half decade. They’ve spent a good portion of their careers slaving for ‘blockchain adoption,’ and now that it’s staring them in the face, they have no idea how to react other than slugging liquor for brunch, dazed,  mumbling to themselves about ConsenSys equity. 

Their energy is in stark contrast to the chillionaires, the very rich, very relaxed individuals with very few complaints about life. They’re the guys who bought hundreds of thousands of ETH at a fraction of a dollar. You can spot them because they’re wearing multiple rolexes on each arm, board shorts and flip flops, even in frigid-ass Denver. Nobody spots them faster than the bizdev shills, though, who are like guppies into the maw of these mega-whales. Here’s how you survive a hard sell from one of those desperate pitchmen who treat you like a microphone: smile and nod, smile and nod. Do not answer any of their rhetorical questions, because they’re all just hooks for another shill. Smile and nod. That’s how a thousandaire becomes a chillionaire.

While incredibly well socialized Ethereum developer Danny Ryan is on stage discussing semantic mismatches in the transition to Proof of Stake, the din from the reaches of the castle is deafening. Grizzled developers in newly spangled swag sweatshirts yuk it up with NFT obsessives in bedazzled leopard print, comparing shillhaul – which this year included free weed, USB lighters, and translucent metal sporks. Tiesto is in the building. The governor of Colorado just showed up. Vitalik’s mum is holding court. Someone dressed as Boba Fett saunters through the crowd. 

“The merge is really, actually very close,” Ryan exhorts over the noise. That gets everyone’s attention. Ethereum Maxis talk about the merge like Heaven’s Gate members talked about the comet. It’s the second coming of Jesus and Jobs and Jehovah alike. On the day the *don’t-call-it-ETH2.0* shards enliven, Vitalik will ride into the floor of the NYSE on a pale unicorn atop a rainbow that rains coins to save us all from our current reality: the one in which we’re already in a bear market and nobody except for VC Cunts and chillionaires have the wherewithal to admit it yet. 

Speaking of: Look to your left. Now look to your right. chances are that one of you is a VC cunt. The ‘VC’ stands for ‘very cunty.’ A message to your ilk from the rest of us: Take your billions of dollars, your fuckin’ social skills, your well-adjusted attachment styles, your consistent sleep habits, your workout routines, your pearly white teeth — and go copy/paste someone else’s Ponzi scheme! 

In the spirit of self-congratulation, ETH devs are here to PARTY. That means drinking enough alcohol to maintain eye contact! Woo! A fresh-faced, motor-mouthed young Web3 acolyte who works for a VC —  although he promises it’s not a cunty VC — has a salient piece of advice for anyone, but especially those in crypto: Never meet your idols. He encountered one of his at an ETHDenver afterparty, a guy ‘worth a quarter of a billion at least,’ languishing in a catatonic state, mumbling about ‘the best acid in Denver.’ Apparently, that did not fit his idea of a post-millennial tech baron. He’s learned better now. 

An interlude: What does a stablecoin have in common with a dominatrix? It’s all fun and games until you’re in too deep and they lose their peg. If it’s UST, you’re moving back into mom’s basement. If it’s your local Mistress, you’re going to the hospital. You’re fucked either way. 

Speaking of fucked: DAOs may be both the ‘new venture capital’ and the ‘next sovereign nations,’ but you may not get that vibe from the myriad DAOs that have proliferated in recent times — BluntDAO, PartyDAO, SporkDAO, SlutDAO, for example. DAOs may change the world yet, but not until they roll a blunt, have a boogie, get the munchies, and visit a sex worker — so just like most politicians, then. 

While an opera singer takes to the stage on the upper BUIDL floors for an impromptu performance, surprise guest Andrew Yang appears on the main stage. The room is packed and the audience listens on rapt. The wider crypto industry has been waiting on tenterhooks on the promise of a damaging Executive Order from President Joe Biden, and Yang has the inside scoop. He’s bullish on the EO, saying it won’t be as bad as many fear, but bearish on the long-term prospects of governmental meddling in the space. He says it’s a call to arms moment for the industry, and that we should all take it upon ourselves to fight back. He suggests gamifying lobbying, which actually sounds like a pretty good idea. 

All of this isn’t to distract from the main point here: a conference with all the Etherati in one place is totally against the ethos of decentralization. Single point of failure! That’s blockchain 101. What happens if one disgruntled Solana dev sneaks into the Castle with a bomb strapped to his back? They are capable of this. Those guys blow up their own chain on a monthly basis.

The real stuff at ETHDenver is on the upper floors of the Castle, where the devs have been at work hackathoning away since before the hordes arrived, and where they remained when the hordes left. Developers are more mythical beast than the bufficorn could ever be, and here’s where you find those rare creatures in their habitat, buried deep behind the hype machines and money printers. Rows and rows of people, heads down, headphones on. This is the actual source of the substance of the event, the whole industry even. Shit, maybe even the whole world. Every so often, they take breaks to eat stale pizza and play DDR and Mario kart in the arcade, drum and bass blasting all the while. It’s on these floors that  you’ll find anything resembling solace in the chaos. 

ETHDenver is a place where the developers who build the stuff, the shills who sell it, the storytellers who narrate it, and now the consumers who actually use it are all there under one roof. Yeah, it’s disorganized, but this is the kind of chaos from whence *stuff* happens. When things get organized, they get lame. ETHDenver is the Birthplace of BUIDL, and it retains that accolade. Sure, 20,000 applicants and only about 150 hackathon projects offers a ratio of about 1 in 20 builders to shillers, but that’s pretty fucking good for crypto. Your average Bitcoin conference is just a mass congregation of undersexed sociopaths yelling past each other about Wikipedia-level macroeconomics. In comparison, ETHDenver is a wellspring of substance and positive energy. 

Unfortunately the price of ETH did not mirror the buoyancy of the energy of ETHDenver, dropping over 15% over the course of the week. But nobody talked about markets or asset prices, even as they dropped precipitously and consistently all weekend. There’s something beautiful about that. ETHDenver envisions itself as a builder of culture for Ethereum, decentralization, and the creation of value in communities, and it does come good on that promise. 

There’s two surefire ways to know when a party is over. The first is when you receive a COVID exposure notification from the exclusive afterparty the night prior. The second is when fuckin’ Diplo shows up. Both happened on Sunday night. The Denver airport was apparently like an Ethereum transaction mempool on Sunday night, so most of you are using the same criteria for figuring out when it’s time to GTFO. ",106.0,2022-02-23 16:20:25,0.94

"If you think NFTs are useless, you're wrong! Here's why (prove me wrong)","I always find it funny that people are so quick to call NFTs a scam when it's a space that is so new and still finding its feet in Web 3,0. Funnily enough, it's always towards the trading component and never about use cases outside of this niche within the space. Usually, because they have no idea of the other utility that's being created and built.

It's undeniable that the list of use cases will continue to grow and they will become part of our lives over time. Some of the below are either happening now or will eventually become tangible in 2022-23.

**Vertical Marketplaces**

NFT projects will shift towards DTC marketplaces like larvalabs and SolanaMBS. Managing user experience is critical for retention, and eliminating 3rd parties doesn’t hurt.

**Soulbound NFT's**

NFTs are lauded for their transferability, but there are many use cases for non-transferable tokens: driver’s licenses, diplomas, certifications, proof of attendance, etc. Soulbound NFTs lock-in provenance, and can not be sold.

**Retail Sector**

Retailers from 7-11 to Gamestop will use NFTs to incentivize IRL transactions, leveraging creators to drive traffic to storefronts. For example, Yeezy NFTs that airdrop with purchases from Gap stores, or NFTs that unlock exclusive features for Tesla vehicles.

**Borrowing Platforms**

Because NFTs can unlock temporary access—like entry to conferences—markets for short-term lending are emerging. Imagine this as a marketplace: StubHub, but for NFTs.

**NFT Indexes**

Getting exposure to hundreds of NFTs via indexes will boom as market movers tap collectors for funds. Imagine a Christie’s NFT ETF. They have the influence to get assets to liquidity—investors will ape into that. It will also broaden support for NFT communities.

**Bounties**

Creators and brands will drop unique quests within communities, rewarding completion with NFTs. This could be anything from completing a questionnaire to referring members into the community, to attending events. Bounties can be highly competitive, or open wide.

**Social Investing**

Web3 streamlines investing by reducing manual processes like spreadsheet mgmt + signature collection. It also acts as a social record—startups like PartyRound will build networks around such activity, and reinforce them with NFTs.

**Legal**

The benefits of block security and its ability to trigger transactions via oracles will accelerate the adoption of web3 legal services + contract development. A DocuSign killer (or acquisition target) will be built in 2022, and it will deliver NFTs to contract executors.

**Services**

NFTs will unlock access to services and hobbyist communities. Q&As and tutorials with influencer chefs, photographers, doctors, and niche enthusiastic communities will boom. This will also extend into IRL services like transportation, hotels, and spas.

**Content Submission**

Users will submit content like short-form videos, reviews, and tutorials in exchange for NFTs. It’s a marketing flywheel. Rights can be programmed into contracts so that the use of the contributor’s content in advertising could yield their future profits.

**Activism**

Communities, where NFT ownership supports political causes, will gain traction as millions flow into community wallets. Imagine environmental NFT collectives where sales are directed towards lobbying efforts, and those efforts are coordinated by a community DAO.

**Social Feed Marketplaces**

Social feeds based on NFT collections will emerge, providing insight into the strategy of top collectors, and a platform for collectors to interact. These feeds will evolve into social commerce marketplaces, featuring reviews, analytics, and more.

**Multiplayer**

NFTs will create hive activity by incentivizing group behavior. MMORPGs that unlock levels once 10k users have aped in. Airdrops of rare NFTs to collector cohorts that have signed contracts to merge their base-layer NFTs. Collecting is going to become a team sport.

**Collateralization**

To date, lenders have been averse to NFT holders borrowing against their assets. But as institutional money flows in, and assets become better stores of value, collateral markets will promise flexibility and liquidity for all NFT holders, not just whales.

**Fractionalization**

Splitting up NFTs into individual shares gives more people exposure to blue-chip assets, like owning a piece of a CryptoPunk. The result? More liquidity for holders and more appreciation of blue-chip assets as money enters the markets.

**DeFi**

As enthusiasts become more comfortable staking and farming their holdings for yield, NFTs promise incentives beyond APY%. NFTs will become base DeFi assets, with community access included. These won't be simple savings plays—they'll also be investments in communities.

**Loyalty Exchanges**

As brands and creators seek to reinforce loyalty, community behavior will be rewarded with NFTs. Did the member contribute content? NFT. Complete surveys? NFT. Make a purchase? NFT. Tokens are more liquid and bragworthy than traditional discount codes.

**R&D**

Brands and creators will exchange NFTs for insights on product development: pain points, marketing claims, roadmap, and more. The NFTs will unlock early access to product releases and potential profit sharing. Brands will track and maintain these key relationships.

**Customer Cohort NFTs**

Imagine receiving an NFT for being one of the first Air Jordan customers, and how valuable that would be today. How Nike might reward you years later with special access and product. Cohort NFTs prove that you took a certain action, at a certain time.

**Education and Customer Support**

Upon demonstrating exceptional knowledge of a brand’s product, users can receive NFTs in exchange for onboarding newbies into the community, or providing support. This can be exponentially more impactful than a brand employee doing the same.

**Leaderboards**

NFT communities will gamify by highlighting the performance and participation of top holders. Top contributors will receive rewards and clout, thereby incentivizing communities to hold and participate in order to secure better returns on their investments.

**Frequently Asked Questions**

**Where's the best place to buy ETH?**

There are many centralized exchanges that support Ethereum. If you live in the US, the most popular exchanges are Coinbase, Gemeni and Kraken. Coinbase users can use Coinbase Pro for lower fees.

**When is Eth2 launching?**

Eth2 is a marketing term used to represent a number of updates to Ethereum. The Eth2 proof-of-stake chain first launched in December 2020. ""The Merge"", which is the event that will fully switch Ethereum's consensus to proof-of-stake, is estimated to be ready in early 2022, although there is no exact timeline. Other updates, such as data shards, will follow that update.

Visit [ethmerge.com](https://ethmerge.com/) to learn more about ""The Merge"".

**Do I need to do anything to update to Eth2? Will Eth2 create a new token?**

No, ETH holders *never* need to take any action to keep holding ETH. Ethereum users will be unaffected by the Eth2 upgrade. And the Eth2 updates will not create any new tokens.

**How can I stake my ETH?**

There are two ways that you can stake your ETH: by running your own validator, or providing your ETH to a staking pool.

* Running your own validator requires a modern computer and 32 ETH. Visit /r/ethstaker for more details
* Staking pools accept any amount of ETH. We recommend [Lido](https://lido.fi/) or [StakeWise](https://stakewise.io/)

**Why are Ethereum transaction fees so high?**

Like most blockchains, Ethereum fees are determined by supply-and-demand. The large demand to use Ethereum has pushed transaction fees quite high (however, fees were just a few cents only 2 years ago). Fees are especially high during market volatility, and during NFT drops.

**What is being done to lower Ethereum transaction fees?**

Ethereum fees are reduced by using layer-2 rollups. Rollups are scaling solutions that allow for significantly cheaper transactions, while still maintaining Ethereum's security.

Additionally, Eth2's data shards will make rollups even cheaper.

While rollups are cutting-edge technology being actively developed, a number are already live on Ethereum mainnet. Visit [l2beat.com](https://l2beat.com/) to learn more about rollups.

**What's the best wallet for Ethereum?**

The most popular tool for using decentralized applications is Metamask. However, for security reasons, we recommend using a hardware wallet such as a Trezor or Ledger.

My dad has 8 ethereum in a MEW account he forgot about..,"My dad recently told me he has 8 ETH tokens he bought 5 years ago in an account he can’t seem to access in MyEthereumWallet.com (edit: I meant to say MyEtherWallet.com) but kept the print out of the address and private key. Apparently he’s tried contacting MEW and there’s no one there to support. I’ve never used MEW myself but I want to help him get access to his money. I have a Coinbase account but I’m not super familiar with how this works. Is there a way to use the keys to transfer the funds to cash out?

Update: I was successful and was very easy to recover. There’s a way to access your wallet using just your private key on the MEW platform without logging in (tho it’s not recommended). Once I accessed it I was able to send all the ETH it to my coinbase account with an address I generated and now I can cash it out or hold on to it for my dad. Can’t wait to tell him tomorrow. Glad he didn’t forget his key.

Thank you all to those who commented below with helpful tips. My curiousity is piqued and going to do more research into Meta Mask. 

And to those who DM’d me with uncertified websites  for “validating my wallet” (and private key) and acted like you were helping - I enjoyed fucking with you all.. but on a serious note may misfortune follow you around like a plague for the rest of your days.

Gonna buy my first ETH soon. Couple of beginner questions.,"Hello r/ethereum. I have been researching this project for a little while and I am going to buy some Eth soon. I was hoping you all could help me with a couple questions.

1. I am considering either Binance Us (in the usa here), Coinbase Pro or Kraken to buy it as from my research these seem like widely used reliable exchanges with the lowest fees and most coin options? Are these good exchanges? What exchange/trading app is the best to buy Eth on? Why do you prefer it/what are the fees (and are they the lowest/if not why do you prefer it)? Which would you recommend for Eth (or any coin) and why?
2. I want to purchase a Ledger Nano X to store my crypto after buying it. Is there one of these exchanges that is best/easiest to transfer your funds to a hardware wallet like this one? Does anyone here have experience with doing specifically this and could explain or point me to some info explaining how it works?

Thanks in advance!",47.0,2022-02-18 02:49:05,0.87
Why did the community choose to hard fork after the ‘The DAO’ attack?,"What the title says.

Why is a validator punished for downtime in Proof of Stake?,"So in ETH PoS scheme (and in the PoS scheme of other cryptocurrencies), staked tokens can be slashed if the validator is offline for too long. But why? Why can't the network be designed to be resilient to such failure? In Proof-of-Work, no miners or full nodes get punished if they just stop. They only stop receiving rewards when they stop, not getting their existing profits retracted.

I'm concerned about this because this ""always-online"" requirement scares away most people from running a validator on their own (that plus the 32 ETH is too expensive). This encourages centralization.

[Official docs](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/consensus-mechanisms/pos/#pos-staking-validators):

>  For example, a user can lose a portion of their stake for things like going offline (failing to validate) or their entire stake for deliberate collusion.",26.0,2022-02-16 10:59:12,0.79
Selling a NFT feels like im working with TicketMaster,"So okay okay...the title of this post is mostly a joke. 

So a couple months ago I minted an NFT for like $150. lets see some of the fees that went into this.   
Going to approximate since I dont remember them exactly. 

Item sold for about 1ETH today

1. $30 minting transaction fee 
2. $70 open sea fee to list item for sale at  fixed price
3. $50 open sea fee to later change sale to an auction
4. $316.5 (10% creator fee)
5. $158.25 (5% royalty fee) 
6. $94.85 gas transaction fee to complete sale.

Are you kidding me. Like yah overall I made money on this sale but this is insane. Seems the only reason this is considered acceptable is because people are making a ton of speculative trading anyway.

**Frequently Asked Questions**

**Where's the best place to buy ETH?**

There are many centralized exchanges that support Ethereum. If you live in the US, the most popular exchanges are Coinbase, Gemeni and Kraken. Coinbase users can use Coinbase Pro for lower fees.

**When is Eth2 launching?**

Eth2 is a marketing term used to represent a number of updates to Ethereum. The Eth2 proof-of-stake chain first launched in December 2020. ""The Merge"", which is the event that will fully switch Ethereum's consensus to proof-of-stake, is estimated to be ready in early 2022, although there is no exact timeline. Other updates, such as data shards, will follow that update.

Visit [ethmerge.com](https://ethmerge.com/) to learn more about ""The Merge"".

**Do I need to do anything to update to Eth2? Will Eth2 create a new token?**

No, ETH holders *never* need to take any action to keep holding ETH. Ethereum users will be unaffected by the Eth2 upgrade. And the Eth2 updates will not create any new tokens.

**How can I stake my ETH?**

There are two ways that you can stake your ETH: by running your own validator, or providing your ETH to a staking pool.

* Running your own validator requires a modern computer and 32 ETH. Visit /r/ethstaker for more details
* Staking pools accept any amount of ETH. We recommend [Lido](https://lido.fi/) or [StakeWise](https://stakewise.io/)

**Why are Ethereum transaction fees so high?**

Like most blockchains, Ethereum fees are determined by supply-and-demand. The large demand to use Ethereum has pushed transaction fees quite high (however, fees were just a few cents only 2 years ago). Fees are especially high during market volatility, and during NFT drops.

**What is being done to lower Ethereum transaction fees?**

Ethereum fees are reduced by using layer-2 rollups. Rollups are scaling solutions that allow for significantly cheaper transactions, while still maintaining Ethereum's security.

Additionally, Eth2's data shards will make rollups even cheaper.

While rollups are cutting-edge technology being actively developed, a number are already live on Ethereum mainnet. Visit [l2beat.com](https://l2beat.com/) to learn more about rollups.

**What's the best wallet for Ethereum?**

The most popular tool for using decentralized applications is Metamask. However, for security reasons, we recommend using a hardware wallet such as a Trezor or Ledger.

I made a tool to analyze my gas usage across multiple blockchains. Here are the results:,"In total, I spent over $3000 just in gas fees on 809 transactions across 5 different blockchains: Ethereum, Avalanche, Fantom, Binance Smart Chain, Polygon.    

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/ofvxtcsrknh81.png?width=949&format=png&auto=webp&s=049be8a2c2a8430675a27593aa26c8de679149d1

To see my spending trends over time, I plotted all my transactions on a scatter plot. For convenience, I also linked each transaction to its chain explorer transaction details page to get full insight into the transaction.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/84pr9yuvknh81.png?width=1304&format=png&auto=webp&s=b2ab0c0d756584a35b1bc2e3b6e07364bbc0db0b

To compare the average transaction cost among blockchains, I created a pie chart. In terms of the cost per transaction, Polygon wins hands down, and to nobody's surprise, Ethereum is a gas guzzler. One caveat is that this chart does not differentiate between different types of transactions which may skew the final results. As an example, I perform a lot of contract interactions on Avalanche which, in theory, would bring its cost per transaction up.

"In my opinion, the cannabis industry deserves a DeFi solution","In light of the fact that governments are gaining control over anything crypto-related, I'm skeptical that the DeFi will actually be successful. Many markets have been left without viable answers, and one of these is the cannabis industry.  


Despite the fact that cannabis has been legal for quite some time, there have been several complaints about a lack of established DeFi solutions for the market. This has resulted in a great deal of frustration. Why can't we have anything we can use when the number of decentralized alternatives continues to grow and the majority of people are unable to comprehend it and instead choose to purchase shitcoins?  


As a cannabis consumer and follower, I've always questioned why, after all this time, there hasn't been a successful non-schematic cannabis project to date. A decent effort that seeks to bring the community together, Tangi appears to be a good example of this. The fact that many legal cannabis outlets only accept cash as payment further demonstrates to me that there is space for competition",22.0,2022-02-11 21:23:22,0.8
Vitalik Buterin takes a stand against Russian aggression,"He is the only prominent member of the cryptocurrency community to speak out against Russia, calling for de-escalation.

Video game companies need to PROPERLY incorporate NFTs,"The video game industry has been plagued with mind tricks and micro transactions to get you to spend money in game and people are tired of it, now, you have big names in the industry saying theyre adding NFTs into the mix? No one is going to look at that and say its positive for the industly.

Ubisoft, for example, was too vague on their announcement and resulted in heavy backlash with little to no support of their decision.

https://preview.redd.it/yke2c0htkwg81.jpg?width=1280&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=64f8949017a2dff9f9b5b09d3c2747e21558ca9a

However,

if instead of directly selling the NFTs through a marketplace for use in game, you find them in game to exchange wherever youd like. No one wants to give more money to greedy companies but I personally would be okay giving money to someone who grinded for days to get a weapon with favorable stats and is now selling it on an ingame or off game marketplace. Asking a company to exchange value without it being given to them is a stretch I know but if one company does it well, people wil start to realise theyre just throwing money and time at a company that gives you nothing in return.

If you allow for an open and free marketplace of in game items, it would naturally build trust in the company as well as keeping the value within the people that actually play the games. Plus, NFTs gives you true ownership over your assets. Yes, I know its a centralized game, but, the assets belong to you. If your account gets banned because you decided to use one too many offensive words, your items would still be in your possession despite not having an account. You retain value of your in game progress even if they decide you dont deserve to play their game.

the technology obviously isnt developed far enough for anyone to incorporate that into their game just yet, but I dont get the people who say blockchain gaming will never take over the industry. I personally would rather play a game where I own the items than a game where i can pay for them to allow me to use their items.

"Sequoia just invested 450 million dollars into Polygon, This is not only big for Polygon it is big for Ethereum too.","This  news literally just dropped on CNBC. Sequoia The Silicon Valley venture  capital firm led a $450 million investment in Polygon. I think this is  massive as far as mass adoption for Polygon is concerned. A VC like this  putting in this kind of money into your product speaks volume.

These  are people who have ran many successful companies and businesses. They  know a successful product or ecosystem when they see it. I think when  VCs invest into something this intensely then we as small time investors  should take note. These people have teams of researchers, they know a  ton that we don't about tech and the market.

Frankly  with how things have been going for Polygon. I'm not surprised to see  this kind of money starting to circulate and these kinds of people  starting to take note. 1M users on Opensea, The fastest ZK around and  the fact that the ecosystem went from 3,000 dApps to 7,000 dApps in a  couple of months are things to take note of for sure.

""Polygon  plans to allocate $100 million of the funding to an “ecosystem  fund”  supporting the development of new projects on its network. The  rest  will serve as  “buffer money” to help Polygon’s 240-person team   continue building out the platform in the years to come."" - A quote from  the CNBC article.

I think the  above quote speaks volumes to Polygon's plans for the future and I'm  incredibly excited to see where this is going to go.

Why wouldn't Proof of Stake drastically reduce block times vs. Proof of Work?,"I heard that [Proof of Stake will only reduce block time by \~1 second to 12s](https://blog.ethereum.org/2021/11/29/how-the-merge-impacts-app-layer/). Why only 1 second?

Intuitively, it would seem to me that Proof of Stake (PoS) should be able to drastically reduce block times vs. Proof of Work since it replaces the computationally expensive PoW piece and the arms race nature of everyone mining at the same time with random validator assignment. Thus the bottleneck under PoS would only be the network latency it takes to propagate the newly created block to the number of validators required for consensus (51%?) + time it takes for those validators to validate/attest that newly created block and propagate their attestation back to everyone else. I don't know what the block propagation latency on ethereum is to reach 51% of nodes, but I can't imagine that being more than a few seconds.

I understand that reducing block times too low under Proof of Work would be offset by increased computational waste and forking (due to everyone mining concurrently and network latency). But wouldn't this problem be eliminated under Proof of Stake, thus enabling faster block times (and subsequently higher transactions/second)? **(EDIT: I elaborated on my reasoning in** [**this comment**](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/slzfsd/comment/hvtw4et/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)**)**

Is there a detailed explanation/analysis somewhere comparing Proof of Stake vs. Proof of Work from a performance standpoint? Why is Proof of Stake only 1 second faster than Proof of Work?

Layer2 Sunday - Resources to help you get started using next generation Ethereum today 🔥,"Hi everyone,

You may have heard about the next generation of Ethereum scaling solutions, seen a little bit of chatter about starks, snarks and roll-ups, or even come across the hashtag #L222 - and wanted to dip a toe in and actually try it out rather than just reading about it?

As pointed out in the 2021 Year in Ethereum review, scaling is not only already here, but devs and users are already migrating and the next wave of innovative DeFi, NFT and Gaming projects are launching: [https://stark.mirror.xyz/q3OnsK7mvfGtTQ72nfoxLyEV5lfYOqUfJIoKBx7BG1I](https://stark.mirror.xyz/q3OnsK7mvfGtTQ72nfoxLyEV5lfYOqUfJIoKBx7BG1I)

Over time, less and less dApps will even launch on L1 and many will be L2 only, so it's time to save yourself some fees and get moving to the next frontier of Web3.

If you're ready to be early to the next wave, then today is the day. Sunday is the quietest day of the week for blockspace demand and the time that bridging your hard earned ETH becomes cheapest. There's no better time to take the leap. Quick, before the apes decide to mint another 10k jpegs! [https://www.gasprice.io/](https://www.gasprice.io/)

Hardware wallet for blind/visually impaired people,"Is there any (forget good) hardware wallets for blind or visually impaired people? Barring that, is there any Android-based hardware wallets where talkback can be enabled... that also have headphone jacks? If there are, are they actually usable with talkback(read: are all of the buttons labelled? Are at least the common buttons labelled)? And, If somehow there is an answer to all of that, is it less than #1,000. I did a basic search and this topic does not appear to have come up before. If it has, I would appreciate a link to an old discussion.

Edit(for future me):
Of the mobile wallets I have tried nearly all of the ones listed as being compatible with Arbitrum as of Feb 2022 and the only one that I can actually get loaded as Trust Wallet. Metamask wants a password but when I enter 8 characters into both text fields... the next button remains greyed-out(likely that I mis-typed one of the m, but nothing says that so I amnot going to do the work the developer should have done)

Rainbow wallet has ""fields"".. in quotes because they have the exact same label as the actual label and are obviously customer widgets because Voice Over doesn't announce them as secure text fields(Why did Rainbow implement customer password fields? WHo knows ? Are they recording my password? They wrote the app so that seems like a lot of work for something that they get anyway. 

Nearly all of the others use customer interface elements so I assume they all use flutter or some other ""cross-platform"" development environment. 

DeKey wants me to buy a card but they have other unlabeled elements for their software wallet. Why should I buy a card or a biometric authenticator? Will it work with my iPhone? Will it work with Android? DOes it need a dongle? The spare cards appear to work for both Ethereum and their other blockchain. Why would I need a different reader for two different blockchains? Does it plug directly into the phone? 

How do these companies make any money? Is it the trading fees? Why is there no paid app I can get? Why do all of the websites appear to be cut from the same cookie cutter?

It is frustrating that I can't even throw money at this issue(Fiat or crypto apparently).  A L1 transfer cost $5 at a minimum how has no one decided to charge at least that for a wallet that is supported? Do I need to go to uniswap and ask for a million dollars in order to hire and direct a team? Would anyone actually approve a grant like that?",25.0,2022-02-05 10:20:10,1.0

How Ethereum scales: ELI12,"In short: Ethereum scales with rollups & data availability sampling. But what does that mean?

Firstly, I'll note that the Ethereum roadmap is evolving, so whatever you may have read is already out of date. Especially all the 2018/19 articles about sharding and ""Ethereum 2.0"" - yeah, those are obsolete. Here, I'll briefly describe the state of affairs in February 2022.

# Rollups

Rollups are layer 2 chains that fully inherit Ethereum's security, decentralization, liquidity & network effect properties. [Multiple rollups are live today](https://l2beat.com/), with application-specific rollups like dYdX, zkSync 1.x and Loopring mature & optimized already. Smart contract rollups like Optimism, Arbitrum and StarkNet are in their early stages and awaiting optimizations through 2022.

Optimized rollups today are capable of $0.10 transaction fees with up to 4,500 TPS. Certain highly optimized rollups like dYdX can even scale up to 12,000 TPS. The likes of dYdX, Immutable X and Loopring actually have zero gas fees for trades as it's abstracted from the user. But this is just the beginning. This is like smart contracts in 2016.

The next question becomes - how can we push rollups further?

1. Rollups and application developers themselves will continue to optimize. We have seen Optimism decrease transaction fees by 30% in January, with another 30% cut due soon. Arbitrum also cut their fees in January, with Arbitrum Nitro estimated to slash fees by 50%. This will continue throughout 2022. [Aave developer Emilio describes](https://twitter.com/The3D_/status/1485732340571807745) how they have reduced transaction fees 10x to $0.16-$0.25 on optimistic rollups through optimizations. These are some examples - costs on rollups will continue to decrease over time as they mature.
2. Unlike L1s, rollups get cheaper the more activity there is. So as rollups mature, there's more activity, and token incentives, we'll see rollups get cheaper.

# The Surge

The Surge are upgrades to Ethereum consists of multiple steps that will open the floodgates for rollups. First, we will have intermediate steps like [EIP-4488](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4488) or [blob-carrying transactions](https://notes.ethereum.org/@vbuterin/blob_transactions_simple). These will drop transaction fees by 5 times or more, over and above the two points described above. At least one of these intermediate steps is likely to be implemented around the end of 2022.

The final stage for The Surge is [danksharding](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/sh1trh/danksharding/) \- a data layer built specifically to accelerate rollups. This integrates data availability sampling, and ushers in a new paradigm for blockchains. With data availability sampling, the more decentralized your network is, the more capacity there is for rollups. As bandwidth improves and Ethereum decentralizes, capacity will continue to increase. Over the years, there'll be enough to have millions of TPS across rollups - enough so the whole concept of TPS and transaction fees melts away. We'll be sitting and laughing about the time we used to worry about gas fees. Danksharding will roll out over time, with the first steps likely happening in 2023.

# Statelessness & zkEVM

With The Surge, rollups will have massive scale and ultra low transaction fees. But Ethereum L1 will still be expensive. This doesn't matter because the end users will all be on rollups. But Ethereum L1 will also scale, first through statelessness, and then several years down the line with zkEVM. Even then, the cheapest fees will continue to be on rollups, which is why most people will just use rollups.",503.0,2022-02-04 11:32:14,0.96
Moving MATIC from Coinbase (Pro) to Polygon Network,"I am trying to get my MATIC tokens that are currently on Coinbase Pro onto the Polygon network. I am amazed that there is not better documentation on this process. 

I have gathered that MATIC can only be transfered from Coinbase Pro onto the Ethereum network. Some exchanged, like [crypto.com](https://crypto.com), allow for transfers directly from the exchange to the Polygon network. If that service is not offered by your exchange, you will need to bridge it yourself. This will be a bit more expensive because it requires moving to something like MetaMask and then using the bridge. This is at least two transactions and moving MATIC on the ETH network is not cheap. 

I have transferred from Coinbase Pro to MetaMask. I am now attempting to use the official Polygon bridge - [https://wallet.polygon.technology/bridge](https://wallet.polygon.technology/bridge). Unfortunately, even though I have ETH and MATIC in my MetaMask wallet, the bridge is not recognizing that I have funds. I have connected my MetaMask wallet to the bridge and signed the transaction. Still, it does not recognize my funds. They are stored on my Trezor. I tried with a different MetaMask wallet that is not associated with my Trezor. This seemed to recognize that ETH was in the wallet, but still thought that I had 0 ETH. 

Any ideas on moving MATIC from exchange to Polygon network. Also, general ideas on the best way to get funds on the Polygon network (i.e., exchanges other than Coinbase)",22.0,2022-02-03 23:27:59,0.89

"Here's how 98k ETH was stolen on Solana, explained like you're five","There has been a lot of confusion however how the Wormhole hack had happened, and exactly whose side is at fault. Unfortunately, there is a lot of misinformation going around, and many people are not technical. I'd like to explain how this works.

-----

# ELI5 version:

To create wETH on their chain, Solana checks that there is a valid signature, and that the signature comes from a Guardian.

Proper usage means there is a valid signature (Correct ✅) from a guardian (Correct ✅). These two conditions match, and so request is approved. ✅

They expected an attacker would issue an invalid signature (Incorrect ❌) from a guardian (Correct ✅). These two conditions do not match, so the request is denied.  ❌

-----

# The hack

The attacker issued an invalid signature (Incorrect ❌) from a non-guardian (Incorrect ❌). **But these conditions match: incorrect matches incorrect**. So the request is APPROVED ✅(!!) and the ETH was stolen on the Solana network.

The Ethereum network successfully processed a withdraw, because Solana told Ethereum ""it's all good, this is legit"", but Solana's logic for determining whether it is good was flawed.

For programmers: the check was `==` instead of `&&`.",1709.0,2022-02-03 01:35:00,0.9
When is ETH full switch to Proof of Stake happening?,People have been asking me when ETH full switch to Proof of Stake is happening.  Can someone please provide me with some insight to this question?,23.0,2022-02-02 19:12:53,0.79
Deflation is economically sound for Ethereum,"Some recent comments on this subreddit have suggested that Ethereum should be made inflationary to spur economic activity, so I wanted to give my perspective on why deflation is economically sound for Ethereum.

TL;DR: *Inflation* of a fiat currency erodes savings and *deflation* can bankrupt debtors, slow down economic activity, and lead to unemployment. Central banks balance by targeting a 2 % inflation, keeping some margin for lowering nominal interest rates to 0 % in recessions. For Ethereum, the potential issue with deflation is restricted to slower economic activity. Participants have two attractive choices in the proof-of-stake ecosystem, locking up their tokens for staking or participating in the smart-contract economy. Issuance of new tokens to stakers is the only source of inflation in the system. Inflation can thus be produced by increasing the yield, but this will slow down activity, not increase it, since it incentivizes people to lock up their tokens for staking instead of interacting with smart contracts. A deflationary Ethereum where the burn rate is higher than the issuance rate attracts capital and developers that wish to capture that capital. Thus, deflation is economically sound for Ethereum considering its forthcoming proof-of-stake consensus.

\--------------------------------------------------------

From time to time, it is suggested that cryptocurrencies should be inflationary like fiat currencies so that users are motivated to spend their tokens, not just hold them. It is important to understand the difference between a central bank trying to balance the desire for high employment and low steady inflation of its fiat currency system with that of a proof-of-stake cryptocurrency trying to make its smart-contract economy flourish, maximizing network effects.

Central banks commonly target a 2 % inflation. A too high inflation will erode real wages and savings, lead to rising tensions between social groups and costly periods of disinflation. Periods of deflation on the other hand are often associated with economic crises and bursting bubbles. As demand falls, companies reduce their workforces. Debtors have a hard time paying back their loans denominated in nominal terms and the subsequent defaults remove liquidity, risking a deflationary spiral. Wages would need to fall each year to keep up, but a downward wage rigidity can be expected. In the absence of workers accepting yearly pay cuts, unemployment may rise further. The fact that people can increase their wealth by hoarding cash is also detrimental to economic activity in periods of deflation. Thus, a 2 % inflation target gives central banks some margins down to 0 % so that they can lower nominal interest rates in recessions to spur economic activity, avoid deflation traps, and reduce unemployment.

The realities of proof-of-stake cryptocurrencies like Ethereum are a little different. Deflation causes a rise in the value of the ETH token, but wages are not denominated in ETH and neither are mortgages. Deflation does not bring potential unemployment or spiraling debt burdens. It is rather a fall in price that can be destabilizing, with cascading liquidations among those that lent out their tokens in return for some other form of value, like stablecoins.

The risks of reduced economic activity due to increased wealth from hoarding cash stands out as the most applicable also for Ethereum (hoarding ETH in this case). Certainly, it is desirable with high economic activity and demand. It brings developers to the ecosystem and helps build the network effects that cement Ethereum as the engine of Web3. But now consider the two most interesting options available to token holders in proof-of-stake Ethereum. They may lock up their tokens by staking them, earning yield, or they may use the tokens for economic activity, interacting with smart contracts. Issuance of new tokens to stakers is the only source of inflation in the system. The higher the yield, the higher the inflationary pressure. The higher the yield, the more desirable to lock up tokens instead of participating in the economy. Thus, the relationship between deflation and economic activity is *reversed* in comparison with the fiat economy.

Stakers are a vital part of the ecosystem and should of course be rewarded for their work. But venturing far away from minimum viable issuance to produce inflation will simply constitute a transfer of wealth from those that participate to those that lock up their tokens. Of course, not all forms of ""participation"" may result in high transaction volume. But the mere fact that capital is available and ready to be deployed is arguably important for enticing smart-contract developers to build. If the staking yield is pushed up to produce inflation, the tough competition from the yield of the staking contract discourages development on the chain. It is perhaps not surprising that innovation and economic activity exploded on Ethereum. The promise of an economically sound proof-of-stake consensus in the future in combination with 0 % yield due to proof of work in the short term is an attractive proposition for developers because it produces a lot of capital willing to invest in their DApps. Higher-than-needed staking yield would also force willing participants into a “money lego” of staking derivates, which brings systematic risks to any ecosystem of DApps dependent on them. In a deflationary Ethereum, people can hold ETH tokens without seeing their savings eroded and use them for transactions whenever needs in their daily life arise.

Naturally, it would be possible to produce inflation without pushing up the staking yield if the issued tokens could fund some other desirable development. The problem is that public goods funding is very tricky and would undoubtedly lead to friction in the community. Ethereum is not all-encompassing in the same way that fiat money is within a country. Participants can leave the Ethereum economy at any time if they perceive that their holdings are diluted for questionable reasons or projects. This is a good thing. By preserving the value of the token, we attract people to the ecosystem in open competition. Another way to look at this is to recognize that the deflationary pressure comes from high demand for blockspace (via the burn mechanism of EIP-1559) and the inflationary pressure exists to keep the chain secure through issuance. As long as the chain is secure, deflation is a sign of an in-demand protocol.

One last thing in relation to [Gresham's law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gresham%27s_law):  ""bad money drives out good"", which is often quoted in support of inflationary policies. It is important to note that Gresham's law is applicable for two forms of money with different inherent value but where legal-tender laws specifies that they must be exchanged for the same value. This is not applicable for Ethereum, especially considering the fact that competing forms of money in crypto, including ETH, can easily be reacquired on the open market after using it for payment. For all these reasons, I believe that deflation is economically sound for Ethereum.",47.0,2022-02-02 16:33:00,0.86

**Frequently Asked Questions**

**Where's the best place to buy ETH?**

There are many centralized exchanges that support Ethereum. If you live in the US, the most popular exchanges are Coinbase, Gemeni and Kraken. Coinbase users can use Coinbase Pro for lower fees.

**When is Eth2 launching?**

Eth2 is a marketing term used to represent a number of updates to Ethereum. The Eth2 proof-of-stake chain first launched in December 2020. ""The Merge"", which is the event that will fully switch Ethereum's consensus to proof-of-stake, is estimated to be ready in early 2022, although there is no exact timeline. Other updates, such as data shards, will follow that update.

Visit [ethmerge.com](https://ethmerge.com/) to learn more about ""The Merge"".

**Do I need to do anything to update to Eth2? Will Eth2 create a new token?**

No, ETH holders *never* need to take any action to keep holding ETH. Ethereum users will be unaffected by the Eth2 upgrade. And the Eth2 updates will not create any new tokens.

**How can I stake my ETH?**

There are two ways that you can stake your ETH: by running your own validator, or providing your ETH to a staking pool.

* Running your own validator requires a modern computer and 32 ETH. Visit /r/ethstaker for more details
* Staking pools accept any amount of ETH. We recommend [Lido](https://lido.fi/) or [StakeWise](https://stakewise.io/)

**Why are Ethereum transaction fees so high?**

Like most blockchains, Ethereum fees are determined by supply-and-demand. The large demand to use Ethereum has pushed transaction fees quite high (however, fees were just a few cents only 2 years ago). Fees are especially high during market volatility, and during NFT drops.

**What is being done to lower Ethereum transaction fees?**

Ethereum fees are reduced by using layer-2 rollups. Rollups are scaling solutions that allow for significantly cheaper transactions, while still maintaining Ethereum's security.

Additionally, Eth2's data shards will make rollups even cheaper.

While rollups are cutting-edge technology being actively developed, a number are already live on Ethereum mainnet. Visit [l2beat.com](https://l2beat.com/) to learn more about rollups.

**What's the best wallet for Ethereum?**

The most popular tool for using decentralized applications is Metamask. However, for security reasons, we recommend using a hardware wallet such as a Trezor or Ledger.

"A quick reminder of what ""shared security"" means and why it's so important","When evaluating a smaller chain that is somehow ""connected"" to a larger chain, the most important question to ask is this:

**If an attacker can 51% attack the smaller chain, how much damage can they do?**

This is a very realistic and important question to ask, because the smaller chain is very often *much* smaller (in terms of market cap) than the larger chain, and it's often quite feasible for an attacker to actually buy up 51% of the tokens (or at least 51% of the *staking* tokens), especially if there's a large amount of bridged assets parked inside the chain that they could steal.

* If the smaller chain is an **""independent L1""**, they **can steal everything**. They can make a block that illegally edits the state to give them all the coins, and then withdraw the coins through the bridge, and there's no verification happening on the larger chain.
* If the smaller chain is a **""sidechain""**, they **can steal everything**, for the same reason. However, **security** ***can*** **be slightly better** than fully independent L1s, because sidechains whose block headers are published to Ethereum are guaranteed to revert if Ethereum reverts, preventing thefts involving 51% attacks on Ethereum but *not* the sidechain.
* If the smaller chain is a **""rollup""**, they **can delay transactions** and perhaps even force users to pay L1 fees, but they **can't steal anything**. This is because there is an on-chain mechanism (whether fraud proofs or data availability proofs) that can actually check that the events on the smaller chain leading up to the attacker's withdrawal are all valid.

A couple more niche examples:

* If the smaller chain is a **""plasma""**, they **can delay transactions** and force users to pay L1 fees, but they **can't steal anything**.
* If the smaller chain is a **""validium""**, they can **permanently lock up all the users' money** but they **can't steal anything**. Validiums (eg. [Starkware's ImmutableX](https://medium.com/starkware/starkex-now-for-nfts-bfdc9f4655a2)) are thus an interesting middle ground. They are not quite ""true L2s"" to the same extent as rollups are, because someone who takes over the validium can still deny users access to their funds and extort them, but they are nevertheless significantly more secure than sidechains, and importantly they can be as scalable as sidechains.

**This is what we mean by ""shared security"". If you are hodling assets and doing stuff on the smaller chain, are you as secure as if you were doing it on the larger chain, or are you less secure?** On a rollup or a plasma, you are just as secure. On an independent L1 or a sidechain, you are much less secure. On a validium, you're somewhere in the middle.

&#x200B;

|\[--- Platform type ---\]|\[--- Security compared to base chain ---\]|
|:-|:-|
|Independent L1|very much less secure|
|Sidechain|much less secure|
|Validium|somewhat less secure|
|Rollup|just as secure|
|Plasma|just as secure|

Note also that for reasons I described in [this earlier post](https://old.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/rwojtk/ama_we_are_the_efs_research_team_pt_7_07_january/hrngyk8/), a lot of this is actually symmetric: if you are holding ETC, you are better off holding it on a ZK rollup rooted in ETC than you are holding it wrapped on Ethereum (even if the bridge is a perfect ZK-SNARK verifier of Ethereum's consensus). It's not really about being on the biggest chain you can be. It's about the domain your activity is one being part of the same shared security zone as the domain where the assets you're using were originally issued, where a **shared security zone** is defined as ""a chain, and all other chains \[eg. rollups\] whose security is ultimately dependent only on that chain"".

But this doesn't change the above categorization; it only makes it stronger, as these differences in security persist even if Ethereum itself gets 51% attacked.

Some more specific examples:

|\[--- Asset is issued on ---\]|\[--- You are using that asset on ---\]|\[--- Security level ---\]|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Ethereum|Ethereum|High|
|Ethereum Classic|Ethereum Classic|Medium-high|
|Bitcoin SV|Bitcoin SV|Low|
|Ethereum|Avalanche|Low|
|Avalanche|Ethereum|Low|
|Ethereum|StarkEx (rollup mode)|High|
|Ethereum|Arbitrum|High|
|Optimism|Ethereum|High|
|Arbitrum|ZkSync|High|

This is because (Ethereum, Optimism, Arbitrum, ZkSync, StarkEx rollup mode) are in the same shared security zone (as the latter four are all ultimately secured by Ethereum, or at least soon will be when the fraud proof mechanism is fully enabled with all temporary backdoors removed), but Avalanche and Ethereum Classic are not and likely never will be.

BSV is insecure on BSV despite being in the same shared security zone as itself, because BSV is a weak PoW chain that is easily attackable by bored BTC and/or BCH miners and has blocks that are too large for users to verify (with no plans to add sharding/ZK-SNARK/DAS technology to fix this), so someone who 51% attacks BSV can just push invalid blocks through and users would probably have no choice but to accept them.",1626.0,2022-01-30 16:44:11,0.98
[PSA] We should do something for todays HALF MILLION lost tragedy to NEVER EVER happen again.,"[r/Ethereum Today's Headline, The Original Post of Said Tragedy](https://np.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/sfz4kw/did_i_just_lose_half_a_million_dollars_by_sending/)

TL,DR: We should start a campaign, here is our appeal:

1. All wallet software orienting average user, shall ban the action of, or give the scariest warning it can give if the user initiates a tx that directly calls *transfer* function to a Contract address.
2. We should promote and accelerate the deprecation of raw ERC-20, and the wider adoption of newer, more robust and fault-proof ERC-777 and ERC-1555 standards.

No matter what role you are playing in the scene - Blockchain developers, DeFi users, NFT hodlers, investors, today's tragedy is a serious alarm to us all that, Ethereum, along with many other blockchain technologies, are yet to be fully fledged for mass adoption.

This is fully understandable because the nature of new technologies is, no matter how many work we do to make the design perfect, it needs to be tested in the field first for problems to be reveal and fixed.

ERC-20 token standard is one of them, it's such a classic standard with long history and a whole ecosystem built upon it, but we all forgot that the philosophy behind its design is still immature, leading to serious loophole and design failure.

Sending ERC-20 token to any sort of Smart Contract is pointless and exceedingly dangerous. In usual business logic, if user want a certain smart contract to have certain token, what they should do, and the way the Smart Contract should absolutely implement is: user approve in ERC-20 token contract first, then you make user to call a function exposed by your Contract, in the function, your Contract calls *transferFrom* function on ERC-20 Token Contract, so that your contract is aware of this transfer.

An ERC-20 *transfer* function call, to ANY **CONTRACT** ADDRESS, initiated by END-USER (EOA address), is POINTLESS and will ALWAYS result in PERMANENT, UNRECOVEABLE TOKEN LOSS.

Today's tragedy is caused by collective effect of many factor: The nature of Ethereum that all addresses look the same; Lack of user education on smart contract (I see why people blaming [weth.io](https://weth.io) on this, it's fully reasonable, today's victim might came up with the idea him/herself that: hey I send ETH to the contract, got WETH, now I send WETH back, ETH back, that's what the GIF on [weth.io](https://weth.io) says! completely not knowing what's under the hood, the anonymous fallback function and etc.). Lack of on-chain logic checking and preventing this (it would cost everybody's gas).

But the most unforgivable factor is the NEGLIGENCE of wallet software: **ZERO** warning upon sending ERC-20 token to a Contract Address, on the UI I just saw ""Contract interaction: Transfer"", and I'm good to go! To PURGE ALL OF MY HODLING with single mouse click!

That's not how fault tolerance/fault proof should be done - to be honest, that's zero fault proof.

Green across the board, we are good to go right? POOOOF, SNAFU, a poor guy's life saving gone.

This issue has been around for years, and of course, everything on chain is accessible, [etherscan.io](https://etherscan.io) can tell if an address is a contract, Infura can tell if it's a contract. But metamask, ledger live, xxx wallet and etc cannot tell if the address in the text input is a contract.

So, once again in the end, We should start a campaign, here is our appeal:

1. All wallet software orienting average user, shall ban the action of, or give the scariest warning it can give if the user initiates a tx that directly calls *transfer* function to a Contract address.
2. We should promote and accelerate the deprecation of raw ERC-20, and the wider adoption of newer, more robust and fault-proof ERC-777 and ERC-1555 standards.

Why the hell are you still on layer one?!,"We're all moving squad, pack your bags, we're heading to the newfoundland of low fees, high security and decentralization.  If you're still making trades or buying NFTs on Layer one, you're burning money.

***ROLLUPS ARE HERE***

Layer 2 rollups are ready today!  Including [Loopring](https://loopring.org/), [zkSync](https://zksync.io/), [Optimistic Ethereum](https://www.optimism.io/), and [Arbitrum](https://bridge.arbitrum.io/).  No more of that sidechain/sister chain business, we can support Ethereum by moving our assets to any of these layer two chains and increasing Liquidity incentives.  The more of us on L2 the better the sandbox becomes.

***FOR THE NEWBIES***

For those of you who are newbies and have never opened a crypto wallet, or those just doing small trades I'd recommend [Loopring Wallet](https://loopring.io/#/wallet) or [Argent Wallet](https://www.argent.xyz/) (powered by zkSync/starknet).  Both of these systems use smart wallets and make holding crypto stupid proof!  When these scaling solutions launch EVM smart contract, anybody will be able to have world class security for less than than a few dollars.

***FOR THE OUT OF THE LOOP CRYPTO VETERANS***

If you're a bit more experienced, have some crypto savings or just want to continue interacting with Dapps, try bridging your funds to [Arbitrum](https://bridge.arbitrum.io/) or [Optimism](https://gateway.optimism.io/)!  Contract calls are roughly around $1 and make trading easy.  They do lack a bit of liquidity, BUT, the more of us that transfer to these L2 solutions, the more incentive there is for liquidity providers to move!

***WE ALL NEED TO MOVE TO L2 IN ORDER TO INCENTIVIZE LIQUIDITY PROVIDERS TO MOVE!***

""*But mrcleansocks, all my funds are on binance and coinbase? how am i supposed to get to layer 2 without touching layer 1 gas fees?""*

**EASY!**

You need to go to [Layerswap](https://www.layerswap.io/)!  They will help you bridge your funds from CEX's to L2s!  No more dirty nasty layer one gas fees to stop you from being your own bank. SO GET ON IT!

On a twitter spaces call between Optimism, Arbitrum, zkSync, and Starknet, they all said that sub 1 cent transactions are coming!  We are on the verge of Layer 2 2022!!!! It's happening! We are scaling!  But we all need to get off layer one!  So get your shit together and let's roll squad, we're building the new world and it's on Layer two now!

edit - Honestly, mods, we need a sticky post to address this. If you're too lazy, just pin this post so people can find their way to L2",577.0,2022-01-29 17:32:26,0.87

Can we talk about how bad onramps to layer 2 suck?,"Everyone (looking over at you Anthony Sassano and the Bankless crew) raves about layer 2.  Oh, I have no doubt that it's going to change things, but can we be realistic that it absolutely sucks right now?

I would love to try to find a way to fiat onramp to layer 2.  Despite all the hype, it really doesn't seem to exist.  Polygon?   [Crypto.com](https://Crypto.com) had an awesome announcement - all BS - you have to be on their ""Exchange"" product.  Mt Pelerin's Bridge wallet?  Yup, they sure did announce Arbitrum and Optimism but you sure can't buy ETH on them.  Coinbase?  Nothing but promises.  Dharma?  Oh, they got acquired by Opensea, so that's probably going away.  Something, something Ramp - does that actually work?  Can I set up Ramp's wallet and use my bank account or credit card to buy ETH on Arbitrum?

Wait, what's that you say about Polygon?  Yeah, it's a sidechain and I was specifically talking about layer 2.  But hey, to use Polygon all you have to do is go set up a Coinbase account and then transfer to a Metamask wallet, get some MATIC and switch over to Polygon, sell the MATIC for ETH.  Yeah, that's intuitive.",79.0,2022-01-28 23:21:53,0.87

Potential Merge Release Target: Mid June (This is not a finalized date),"There was a [CL call earlier](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bi2qZ2epaPM) where a potential target for the Merge going live was discussed: Mid June. I wanted to jump ahead of the inevitable misinformation claiming this is a hard-set date.

&#x200B;

**At this point**, there is hope that a V2 of [Kintsugi testnet](https://kintsugi.themerge.dev/) will be released in about 2-3 weeks. From there, client code completion is hoped in March with the a release shortly after of a 'finalized' testnet.  If that testnet goes well, a mainnet launch in June should be doable, getting in front of the currently scheduled difficulty bomb that would render Ethereum useless mid-end July if not delayed.

&#x200B;

# Things to understand:

1. This is an **ESTIMATION** based on the current state and understanding. There is nothing that would prevent further issues to arise that could delay this. It is very possible a severe vulnerability is discovered, a bug requiring re-architecture of certain mechanisms, or many other issues could arise.  If they do arise, there will be open discussions about the impact of those issues and what that means for a main net launch. This does not mean there is a 'Delay', just a better picture of where things are.  
 

2. No individual working on Ethereum should be held accountable for a Mid-June release at this point. That is way too far in advance for anyone to possibly plan for based on the complexity of the codebase and ecosystem. What those individuals should be held accountable for is proper communication of the immediate and near-future work they are doing. If they discover or run into issues, they must, and undoubtedly will, raise all the necessary alarms. \[I am not claiming there has ever been an issue with this\]   


3. Please, for the love of whatever, do not spread that Mid-June is some magic hard-set date of when the Merge will go live. It is, at best, an estimate given how everything stands. People have been giving polls of when they 'think' the Merge will go live but no one has a crystal ball that can foresee every potential issue.

&#x200B;

Everyone is excited about this change, rightly so, and people want it out yesterday, but everyone should want a **Correctly Built Merge** to go live, not the one that happens to exist Mid-June.",89.0,2022-01-27 18:26:14,0.94
"Lost 17,000 $ of ETH due to hacked Metamask wallet","Today I created a new account in my Metamask wallet, and then sent 7.73 ETH (\~ 17,000 $ at the current price) from an exchange to it. The transaction went through ([https://etherscan.io/tx/0x94ba0929f5b7fde43fcb1210664dd2e7335702b36c10435b988a5e15f5247d31](https://etherscan.io/tx/0x94ba0929f5b7fde43fcb1210664dd2e7335702b36c10435b988a5e15f5247d31)) and the ETHs went into my account normally. But just 13 seconds later, they were automatically transfered to an unknown addresss out of my control ([https://etherscan.io/tx/0x9956fe0a86aef0ff6252af023baa662e202353d3715befaa671ba5ff71669d14](https://etherscan.io/tx/0x9956fe0a86aef0ff6252af023baa662e202353d3715befaa671ba5ff71669d14)).

I carefully examined the recieving address （[https://etherscan.io/address/0xc48c4e7339cc1f885bdd4ea624429b4039540fed](https://etherscan.io/address/0xc48c4e7339cc1f885bdd4ea624429b4039540fed)), over the past 40 days it has many transactions like this. It seems like my Metamask wallet has been compromised and a bot or smart contract automatically made the transfer.

By searching on Reddit and the Metamask support page, many people have encountered the same problem, but no solution to it. (for example: [https://community.metamask.io/t/metamask-automatically-sent-to-other-address-without-action-taken/6456](https://community.metamask.io/t/metamask-automatically-sent-to-other-address-without-action-taken/6456)；[https://www.reddit.com/r/Metamask/comments/nmve45/funds\_got\_transferred\_out\_of\_metamask\_wallet/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Metamask/comments/nmve45/funds_got_transferred_out_of_metamask_wallet/)).

A Call To ALL U.S Citizens!!,"So as many of you have heard the ""America Competes Act"" can potentially be problematic for crypto in the U.S. This proposition will allow a sole individual to ban exchanges and other financial institutions from engaging in cryptocurrency transactions. The individual that could potentially hold these unchecked powers is none other than the U.S. Secretary of the Treasury Janet Yellen. The very individual who has be opposed of the crypto market since her confirmation, this is also the same individual who had the brilliant idea to look into bank accounts for possible tax evasion.

It doesn't just stop there, this would allow Yellen to employ what is called the "" Bank Secrecy Act"" to require certain financial institutions to report information around transactions potentially connected to money laundering, as well as prohibit them from serving account holders with such alleged ties to illicit funds. While the act isn’t something new it would go against the essence of what Defi stands for. While on paper this can be limited to those are under suspicion of money laundering and illicit fund activity we all know how quick this can be used to cover more users and account holders. This can be dangerous considering Yellen would have unilateral power over this sector.

Crypto means something different to every individual in communities like r/ethereum to some a hedge against the current inflation, a means to increase personal wealth, monetary freedom and anonymity, whatever the reason is we are all in this together.

This post is not to spread FUD or to get people to sell in order to give me a better buying opportunity. I have been in the space and can navigate it according to what my goals are. This post is a mere source of information to allow U.S holders to call the respective representatives and let their voices be heard.

If you're are fortunate enough to have a representative to actually consider its constituents views call them!

If you are like me and reside in California you know calling your representatives regarding topics like crypto is like talking to a brick wall, but we must insists our views are represented fairly on what we want. Hammer their phones and emails people!

Thank you for reading, I look forward to discussing this!

**Frequently Asked Questions**

**Where's the best place to buy ETH?**

There are many centralized exchanges that support Ethereum. If you live in the US, the most popular exchanges are Coinbase, Gemeni and Kraken. Coinbase users can use Coinbase Pro for lower fees.

**When is Eth2 launching?**

Eth2 is a marketing term used to represent a number of updates to Ethereum. The Eth2 proof-of-stake chain first launched in December 2020. ""The Merge"", which is the event that will fully switch Ethereum's consensus to proof-of-stake, is estimated to be ready in early 2022, although there is no exact timeline. Other updates, such as data shards, will follow that update.

Visit [ethmerge.com](https://ethmerge.com/) to learn more about ""The Merge"".

**Do I need to do anything to update to Eth2? Will Eth2 create a new token?**

No, ETH holders *never* need to take any action to keep holding ETH. Ethereum users will be unaffected by the Eth2 upgrade. And the Eth2 updates will not create any new tokens.

**How can I stake my ETH?**

There are two ways that you can stake your ETH: by running your own validator, or providing your ETH to a staking pool.

* Running your own validator requires a modern computer and 32 ETH. Visit /r/ethstaker for more details
* Staking pools accept any amount of ETH. We recommend [Lido](https://lido.fi/) or [StakeWise](https://stakewise.io/)

**Why are Ethereum transaction fees so high?**

Like most blockchains, Ethereum fees are determined by supply-and-demand. The large demand to use Ethereum has pushed transaction fees quite high (however, fees were just a few cents only 2 years ago). Fees are especially high during market volatility, and during NFT drops.

**What is being done to lower Ethereum transaction fees?**

Ethereum fees are reduced by using layer-2 rollups. Rollups are scaling solutions that allow for significantly cheaper transactions, while still maintaining Ethereum's security.

Additionally, Eth2's data shards will make rollups even cheaper.

While rollups are cutting-edge technology being actively developed, a number are already live on Ethereum mainnet. Visit [l2beat.com](https://l2beat.com/) to learn more about rollups.

**What's the best wallet for Ethereum?**

The most popular tool for using decentralized applications is Metamask. However, for security reasons, we recommend using a hardware wallet such as a Trezor or Ledger.

Ethereum 2.0 finality time?,"I'm trying to figure out the finality of Ethereum when it is fully upgraded in several years.  After the merge, splurge, verge, surge, all that jazz, when Ethereum's roadmap is fully complete, what will it's finality time be?

With a 6.4 minute epoc time, will we need to wait 2.5 epocs as I've seen before?  I'm wondering what Ethereum's final form will be and if we will still be waiting 15 minutes to consider a transaction final.

I'm extremely bullish on ETH, but if it's finality will never be under 15 minutes, there HAS to be other chains who will thrive with fast finality times.  In my opinion if this is the case, it confirms that the future is multi-chain.  Are there other solutions on Ethereum that I'm not aware of?

This is just the beginning of end of INEQUALITY - do not forget this,"Markets are going down and suddenly a lot of people are panicking. I just want to say one thing: this is the opportunity to fix a broken system where the rich continue to get richer, and the poor get poorer.

In a world where inequality has been increase and the pandemic made things even worse, blockchain could be the solution to this inequality and having a levelled playing field: DeFi for Finance, NFT for art, Metaverses for property.

Financial Institution today are for the rich: The wealthy pay tiny fees and the small savers end up paying high fees.

Same with the art market: it is rigged by the wealthy, who decide who will be the next expensive artist.

Again this holds true for the property market, where increasing prices is making housing increasingly unaffordable for the average Joe.

Cryptos and the technology behind it, could be a unique opportunity to bring back a levelled playing field in this broken system.

Don’t forget - Rome was not built in 1 day, but we are currently witnessing the beginning of a revolution - and it is online. Together we are strong. We are an army of poor people that simply want more equality….and we are a lot of people! ",58.0,2022-01-23 00:01:32,0.63
ETH coinbase staking tax in thr US,"When I try to do my tax, I downloaded the statement from Coinbase as .csv file.

The first sentence from the csv file:

""You can use this transaction report to inform your likely tax obligations. **For US customers**, Sells, **Converts**, and Rewards Income, and Coinbase Earn transactions are taxable events. For final tax obligations, please consult your tax advisor.""

Then I have this in one of my entry. It appear it used ""Converted 0.1000 ETH to 0.1000 ETH2"". The tax app I used also treated it as a taxable event if I just upload the data. Should I let it be and accept the capital gain or should I fix it manually? I could not find a clear guideline.

A collection of various things the average /r/ethereum browser should know about Ethereum,"So I know it's gonna be very controversial to post a lot of pro-Ethereum stuff in /r/ethereum given all the maxis and ETH killer moonboys who love to spread FUD in every thread. And it's very easy to attack Ethereum when you don't understand what it's trying to be and what it's trying to achieve. So I figured I'd post all the general statements that I and many other have been making over and over for a while now. I'm happy to elaborate on any of them, but please keep the discussion in good faith. I'm also willing to add more points if I forgot some. Some of these are my own opinion, some definitely require more context to understand properly (again, happy to elaborate) but the goal is to quickly summarize all the different stuff that gets brought up over and over.

Anyway yeah, if you're invested in Ethereum, or at the very least interested in it enough to be browsing this sub (why else would you be here lol) then you should be aware of the following:

1. Ethereum is the network, Ether is the currency. And there is no ""I"" anywhere in the name.

2. [Fees are high](https://cryptofees.info/) because that's how much the market values Ethereum's limited blockspace. It's purely supply and demand.
    * Fees scale with [how much computation is being executed](https://docs.ethhub.io/using-ethereum/transactions/), not how much money is being handled. It costs $5 on average to send any amount of Ether, whether it's $1's worth or $1 million's. It costs much more to do swaps and mint NFTs and such because those operations require more computation.
    * There is no way for anyone to artificially keep fees high unless they're willing to [literally burn millions of dollars per day for no reason](https://watchtheburn.com/).

3. Ethereum's blockspace is limited because letting people run nodes themselves on average consumer hardware is important for decentralization.
    * Decentralization is a spectrum and has many meanings from protocol specification, protocol implementation, node distribution, coin distribution, censorship resistance, permissionlessness, etc.
    * Pointing at one aspect to scream ""centralized"" isn't clever nor helpful. Chances are the aspect you point out is known and is an active area of research with a concrete plan on [the roadmap](https://i.imgur.com/vXMaIyZ.png) to address it and increase decentralization some more.
    * No blockchain is ever fully decentralized, especially not from the start – and Ethereum's end goal is to be able to run without a hiccup for *decades* if not *centuries*. At 6.5 years old, it's still very young.
    * If you care about decentralization, invest in and contribute to projects like Ethereum who view it as a goal, not a crutch that ""nobody cares about it that much anyway, let's just [increase the gas limit](https://github.com/binance-chain/bsc/issues/553) to have low fees asap""

4. There is a [vast difference](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/nodes-and-clients/#node-types) between an ""archive node"" (several TBs) and a ""full node"" (hundreds of GBs)
    * Running an archive node is not necessary to sync from genesis and verify blocks and transactions.
    * A full node has all the information enough to generate an archive node.
    * There are plans on [the roadmap](https://i.imgur.com/vXMaIyZ.png) to reduce the storage/bandwidth/RAM requirements of nodes even more, to a point where a smartphone will be able to independently verify and propagate new blocks. 

5. There is no ""when eth2 rolls out"" or ""when devs release eth2"" or god forbid ""when ethereum is upgraded to 2.0"". What there is instead is a roadmap consisting of a series of upgrades aiming to help rollups – *not the base layer* – scale to hundreds of thousands of TPS.
    * Depending on context, Eth1 is usually synonymous with ""execution layer"" and Eth2 usually means ""consensus layers"" ([helpful illustration](https://i.imgur.com/AHHcUgm.png)) otherwise ""eth2"" is an umbrella term for the set of upgrades over a long period of time, but the fact remains that there is no specific instant in time where ""eth1 turns into eth2"".
    * Similarly, there is no ""eth2"" coin. ETH is ETH, you don't have to do anything, the coins you hold today will be the same after the switch to proof of stake.

6. Unlocking staked Ether [will not cause a mass sell-off event](https://twitter.com/domothy/status/1467387422765953029). There is a limited withdrawing queue, it's not gonna happen all at once. And there are many more reasons for more people to start staking Ether than there are for the current stakers to exit en masse.
    * Also, unlocking staked Ether will not be possible directly after the merge. Withdrawals will be enable in the first fork that follows the merge ~6 months later.

7. There are plenty of options to avoid high gas fees, it's perfectly fine to use a sidechain to do your DeFi stuff for now. I use sidechains myself too. Just don't pretend these sidechains will replace Ethereum in any significant way as that's not even what they're trying to do.

8. Switching to Proof of Stake [will not lower Layer 1 gas fees significantly](https://willthemergelowergasprices.org/). Anyone saying otherwise is either misinformed or trying to mislead you into false expectations to bank on the inevitable mass disappointment following the merge.
    * It's still a monumental upgrade that will render possible much-needed upgrades like light clients, statelessness, and sharding, etc. that would otherwise be impossible or impractical to implement on the current proof of work chain.
    * It's basically a way to ""start from scratch"" while keeping the same coin, same users, same dapps, same network effects.
    * PoS has been on the roadmap [since day 1](https://blog.ethereum.org/2015/03/03/ethereum-launch-process/). Yes, estimates of PoS dates have been wrong before. However right now it's all hands on deck on the merge, the spec is done, the beacon chain is running, there is a [merge testnet running](https://blog.ethereum.org/2021/12/20/kintsugi-merge-testnet/), it's happening.

9. Sharding will not lower Layer 1 gas fees significantly either. Sharding is all about *data*, execution on Layer 1 will still be limited and expensive. What data sharding will do is help rollups (Layer 2) scale by several orders of magnitude.

10. [Rollups](https://mirror.xyz/ethmaxitard.eth/iyCAlOexgQKOvoSAAk4utYGEdnESOKb5HstM2_LaqL4) are [already live today](https://l2beat.com/) and they will only [get cheaper](https://l2fees.info/) as more people use them.

11. [Data sharding + rollups is the only sustainable way](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/pk57n7/why_rollups_data_shards_are_the_only_sustainable/) to scale a blockchain globally without compromising decentralization.
    * ""Sustainable"" as in the overall security model doesn't rely on hoping that the coin's price will pump forever to outpace the dilution from the blockchain issuing way more new coins than they collect in fees. Something that all major blockchains (including Ethereum most days, and even Bitcoin) are currently doing.
    * ""Without compromising decentralization"" as in more decentralization = more data for rollups = more scaling (lower individual fees on L2). Decentralization becomes an integral part of the scaling equation rather than a crutch.
    * [The rollup-centric roadmap](https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/a-rollup-centric-ethereum-roadmap/4698) is all about admitting that no single blockchain can do it all by itself and can't compete with what rollups can do. In other words, ""Ethereum maximalism"" amounts to helping independent teams develop rollups, innovate and compete with each other on top of Ethereum's secure, decentralized, and open platform.
    * The true competition of sidechains is rollups, not Ethereum itself. 
    * All the criticisms of a multi-rollup world apply to the current multi-chain world model as well. Except they apply way more to the multi-chain world and can be overcome way more easily in a multi-rollup world.
    * A rollup can settle on any L1, sure, but it's gonna gravitate towards the most secure, most decentralized and most credibly neutral settlement layer with the best data availability. Right now only Bitcoin and Ethereum fit those criteria (other L1s optimize for fast execution, not secure data availability) and Bitcoin would need a hard fork to implement rollup-friendly functions, so that only leaves Ethereum as the poised [""AWS for blockchain""](https://twitter.com/domothy/status/1465905887541972996).

12. Ether isn't meant to be a day-to-day currency that will replace fiat. The use-case of Ether isn't to pay for bread and milk, it's to pay for gas fees and secure the network. All the other use-cases derive from Ether's scarcity, but they're not strictly necessary.
    * Having Ether be an appreciating asset is good for the overall long-term health of the network by providing it with more [economic security, its holders more economic bandwidth](https://i.imgur.com/AErfdod.png), and its users more reasons to hold/stake. The incoming deflation is good.
    * However, the supply is not gonna be deflationary forever. The market dictates how much the blockspace is worth (so how much gets burned) and it also dictates how much the staking APR should be (so how much gets printed) so these two opposing forces will meet in the middle at some point. It's all about [them feedback loops](https://i.imgur.com/3bPV35a.png).

13. The security model trumps the economic model. The core idea behind the economic model is: ""[Minimum viable issuance to secure the network](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/izhkvk/minimum_viable_issuance_why_ethereums_lack_of_a/)"". It was designed from the start to be [disinflationary](https://blog.ethereum.org/2014/04/10/the-issuance-model-in-ethereum/) (as in, inflation % terms goes down over time) with even the idea of fee burning being mentioned in [early](https://blog.ethereum.org/2016/07/27/inflation-transaction-fees-cryptocurrency-monetary-policy/) publications and [FAQ](https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/Proof-of-Stake-FAQ/ba766606790d80422b23650d3326e2d963bdfa87)

14. It's okay to change or tweak things when new research indicates there's a problem with long-term sustainability or security of the current model. These changes don't happen ""on a whim of a few people"", there's a lot of consideration that go into them.
    * And remember, changes happen in a highly adversarial context. If there's *any* possibility of an upgrade causing security problems or being exploited in any way for profit, then it *will* happen. Changes don't just happen for fun ""just because"", they happen when their benefits outweigh the inherent risks of potentially adding more complexity.

15. The Ethereum Foundation is more of a [coordinator than a dictator](https://ethereum.foundation/philosophy/). It's much more of a community-focused bottom-up approach than the top-down structure people think.
    * Everything happens extremely transparently on open forums that no one reads and [public livestream calls](https://www.youtube.com/c/EthereumFoundation/videos) that no one listens to. But everyone who wants to participate is welcome, it's all out in the open.
    * The Ethereum Foundation doesn't code any of the actual software, client teams do. There are 5 major execution clients and 4 major consensus clients, developed by independent teams, to implement the protocol specification. This multi-client approach may be responsible for development delays, but it comes with [security benefits](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/mreacw/psa_the_importance_of_multiclient_and_why_the/)
    * [Anyone can propose an Ethereum Improvement Proposal](https://ethereum.org/en/eips/). You just have to convince others it's a good idea to implement it (most EIPs don't get implemented and fall into obscurity) and the clients could just refuse to code it in if it's a very bad idea. The more time passes, the harder it becomes to push changes to the Ethereum protocol and everything converges to the status quo. (This doesn't close the door to further innovation however, as it's still an open platform on which anyone can build)
    * Vitalik regularly gets his proposals blocked by client teams, other researchers, or the community in general. At most, he's a knowledgeable influence because he knows the tech and cryptography in depth and has been there from the beginning. It's silly to worship him, and it's silly to treat him as Ethereum's Zucc-like CEO. He's ""just some guy"".

16. The ""[DAO hard fork](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-779)"" wasn't a roll-back. Not a single transaction was reverted, no one lost any funds other than the exploiter who could have otherwise gotten away with [15% of the total supply at the time](https://www.coindesk.com/learn/2016/06/25/understanding-the-dao-attack/). It wasn't a bailout of Vitalik and his pals, it was a bailout of a huge chunk of the community from an event that could have killed the whole thing in its infancy. 
    * In the end it's all social consensus, and the consensus from miners, users, developers was strong. Even ""code is law"" is social consensus that [can get reverted in case of major bugs](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Value_overflow_incident). It's all about what the community deems [legitimate](https://vitalik.ca/general/2021/03/23/legitimacy.html).
    * *edit: see comments for more nuance on this point*

17. As far as the [initial distribution](https://i.imgur.com/k3GB8Lh.png) goes, Ethereum's ICO is among [the best of those who had an ICO](https://i.imgur.com/fmW3ytf.png), and as far as the current distribution goes (after 6 years of proof of work and market movements), it's [on par with Bitcoin's](https://medium.com/@adamscochran/the-10k-audit-42c100dd32bb). 60m of the 72m ""pre-mined"" coins went to a permissionless no-KYC sale, and [all the genesis transactions are included in Block #0](https://etherscan.io/txs?block=0) so you can check yourself that there's no hidden coins. Just like Bitcoin, early investors took on big risks and got big rewards. No surprises here. Any concerns of the ICO being a scam or rugpull should have vanished some time in 2015, yet here we are still talking about it for some reason.
    * And if coin distribution is a concern to you because proof of stake, then you should be glad the DAO hack didn't end up with a single person owning 15% of the supply...
    * *edit: see comments for more nuance on this point too lol*

18. There is no ""technical debt"" preventing Ethereum from scaling.

19. EIP-1559 was [not meant to lower gas fees](https://web.archive.org/web/20210205013340/https://willeip1559lowergasprices.org/) and no credible person ever promised it was a scaling solution.
    * It has [many benefits](https://domothy.com/eip1559/) beyond coin burning. The deflation is a nice side effect, and it's certainly not a gimmick meant to pump the price.

20. Proof of Work is really just Proof of Stake with extra steps.
    * In both systems, the goal is reach consensus in a sybil-resistant way. Spending time and energy by computing hashes over and over is just the easiest way to reach that goal. But if we can achieve that goal (randomness + verifiable delay functions) without using the energy of a continent, maybe we should look into it.
    * In both systems, whoever has capital gets to earn more capital by producing more blocks. (Except in Proof of Stake, everyone earns at the same rate, proportional to how much they stake)
    * In both systems, the capital that someone has at stake (mining rigs vs coins directly) is a good indicative that they will play by the rules.
    * By design, [Ethereum doesn't have on-chain governance](https://docs.ethhub.io/ethereum-basics/governance/#on-chain-governance). This means that the people with the most coins can't change the rules under PoS any more than the people with the most hash rate can change the rules under PoW.
    * Just like there are mining pools, there are staking pools. As usual, some options are [more decentralized and community-focused](https://rocketpool.net/) than others.",1065.0,2022-01-20 16:21:08,0.99
We are earlier then you think,"We are earlier than you think, look guys yesterday I was watching a live stream on a card game that I like to play Yu-Gi-Oh! Master Duel to be specific. For those of you who are unaware it's a virtual card game based on the anime Yu-Gi-Oh!. Well anyways I was watching the stream and I made a comment stating that It would be great if it were NFT based and worked on a Blockchain! I've been playing another Blockchain based card game called Splinterlands and I have lots of fun trading cards buying and selling and just thought it would be amazing to have Yu-Gi-Oh! On a blockchain as well. You know to actually own the cards and be able to buy and sell as you please. Well they finally read my comment and seemed really reluctant to the idea and took a poll in the comment section. They said comment 1 if you think it's a good idea and 2 if you don't think it's a good idea. It was flooded with an overwhelming amount of 2's and I really don't think they understand all of the amazing possibilities than can come with being on a Blockchain.I truly believe It is the future of gaming and it hurt seeing so many people ignorant to the idea just because of all the bad press nfts get.

How Will L2 affect ETH Supply?,"Im sure this has been answered often but:

ETH is deflationary, and soon L2's will be where everything is done. When you use Polygon, do you pay the feee in ETH or Poly? Same goes for other potential chains if they make their own coin(Arbi/Opti).

If the fee is paid in their own coin, then the burn rate will be much lower than what we think right now? Or when the fees greatly drop + no fees are paid in ETH, how will that work out.

Basically, when you use L2, will it reduce the burn of ETH or are the fees still paid in ETH regardless",27.0,2022-01-18 13:09:49,0.93

"How Reddit (Web2) is pushing the Development of Web3, Web2.5?","One of the biggest social media platform - Reddit which is incorporated company/ Centralized, is pushing the adoption of Web3 via [Reddit Community Points](https://www.reddit.com/community-points).

These Community Points are ERC20 tokens based on Reddit Arbitrum network( Layer 1 = Rinkeby testnet, Layer 2 = Reddit Arbitrum), Currently they are on testnet but Reddit is working to migrate them into Ethereum Mainnet - once their scaling solution is done. 

These tokens can be used to vote on governance polls, buy premium memberships, convert to Reddit coins, tipping between users and we saw a leak last week showing that there is a chance that these points will be used to buy ads space on the subreddits. 

Currently r/Cryptocurrency MOONs 🌙 
And r/FortniteBR BRICKs 🧱 are the only tokens on Reddit with marketcap of $10M and $1.5M respectively, pretty impressive for a testnet tokens.

There are about 150k MOONs and 75k BRICKs  users, most likely we will see massive increase in users on mainnet (only 3.5% of the subreddit members are using MOONs).

Currently https://RCPswap.com (Reddit Community Points Swap - AMM DEX on Reddit Arbitrum developed by me and other dev) is under development, soon it will have a stablecoin.

**Why it’s important?**
~430,000,000 monthly Redditors can potentially be new Web3 users (430M users are getting Ethereum wallet and exposure to the Defi world), this is mass adoption and should make a difference on Web3 adoption when this project gets officially launched on Mainnet.

**Number of Cryptocurrency users around the world 220M, Reddit can potentially triple that!**

For me it’s interesting to see how Web2 companies are trying to stay relevant:
Reddit with Reddit Community Points,
Twitter with Bitcoin adoption and
Facebook with Metaverse.

Could Circle freeze USDC on any wallet address just like Tether did to USDT?,"Recently [Tether froze 160m USDT](https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2022/01/13/tether-freezes-160m-of-usdt-stablecoin-on-ethereum-blockchain/) on Ethereum. This makes me questioning about the censorship risk of stable tokens issued by centralized entities.

USDC by Circle, BUSD/USDP by Paxos, WBTC by BitGo, etc. Do these tokens can be freezed by the issuers?

How about partially-usdc-backed stablecoins issued by DAOs like DAI by MakerDAO and FRAX by FraxDAO? What will happen if Circle freezes USDC held by those DAOs?

Which stabletoken is truly decentralized? Algorithmic stablecoin on other chain like UST by Terra and cUSD by Celo may have unreliable collateral. sUSD by Synthetix is also collateralized by SNX which may has similar reliability to Terra and Celo.

So, does the truly decentralized stablecoin must only use ETH as collateral? If that's so, then so far as I know, the choice is RAI by Reflexer and LUSD by Liquity. RAI is unpegged while LUSD is pegged to USD. I might just pick both 50/50 as my stable holdings, but RAI is issued by Reflexer Labs which is based in the US, is that a risk?

To be clear, I'm not trying to shill any token/protocol here. I want to find a stablecoin which is the most decentralized stablecoin available rn bc currently I hold tens percent of multiple stablecoins. Can't imagine if those funds are frozen",76.0,2022-01-16 12:07:34,0.95

Exploring the Ecosystem 1: High-level L2 Overview,"Hello /r/Ethereum,

This is going to be the first in hopefully a long line of informational posts about the Ethereum ecosystem. I’m not planning much rhyme or reason to what I cover, but with each post I hope to give a general introduction to the topic at hand and provide a springboard from which a reader can begin additional research. I want to be relatively unbiased in my research and I’ll strive for correctness, but if you see something glaringly wrong please call it out so I can correct the record. The overall goal is not to do an exhaustive “deep dive” into a specific topic but rather to provide an introductory overview so that the reader is equipped to do additional research if they choose. 

So let’s get into the first topic: 

**High-level L2 Ecosystem Overview**

You’ve probably heard about “L2” by now; it’s Ethereum’s solution to the blockchain trilemma. Rather than try to do everything on mainnet, new cryptography concepts have enabled the off-loading of transaction execution to secondary networks called rollups. These secondary networks will be able to “inherit” the security of Ethereum mainnet while bundling thousands of transactions together for drastic fee savings.

For more on the details and theory behind rollups, check out Polynya’s blog: https://polynya.medium.com/ 

But enough about theory- what rollups exist today? What differentiates them? What risks are there? 

First, some useful resources:

https://l2fees.info/ - A simple overview of what some common actions cost on several rollups compared to Ethereum mainnet

https://l2beat.com/ - An incredibly useful site aggregating all sorts of up-to-date information about layer-2s

https://defillama.com/chains – Statistics aggregator for DeFi. Great for comparing TVL between chains and rollups.

[ethl2s.com](https://mirror.xyz/ethmaxitard.eth/iyCAlOexgQKOvoSAAk4utYGEdnESOKb5HstM2_LaqL4) -  Quick reference for all sorts of L2 information including fiat onramps, bridges, wallets, and apps. 

Now, the major players in the rollup space:

* [Arbitrum](https://portal.arbitrum.one/) – The largest rollup by TVL and by number of deployed dApps. Arbitrum uses fraud proofs for security, and usage is very similar to mainnet. Currently centralized and does have admin keys during beta. Fees are a few dollars.
* [StarkWare](https://starkware.co/) – Creators of StarkNet and StarkEx. StarkNet is their general-purpose rollup which is currently in mainnet alpha and only has “test” apps right now. StarkEx is the rollup tech powering dYdX, ImmutableX, DeversiFi, and Sorare. Uses validity proofs for security, and each StarkEx app has different security attributes. StarkEx apps have over a billion dollars in combined TVL, easily the 2nd largest rollup by that measurement.
* [Optimism](https://gateway.optimism.io/) – Arbitrum’s main fraud proof competitor. Usage is again very similar to mainnet and has a decent number of deployed apps. Currently centralized with admin keys and the fraud proofs are not yet operational. Has been un-whitelisted since December 2021, and fees are a bit lower than Arbitrum’s. 
* [Loopring](https://loopring.io/#/) – Everyone has probably heard of LRC by now, but you might not know that it was the first operational validity proof rollup! LRC has been operational for well over a year now and recently launched their L2 smart wallet app. They’re one of the few rollups with a token right now. Loopring has fairly good security, their main flaw is that there is no delay on code updates; they do have an operational “escape hatch” however. Fees are generally under $1 for transfers. 
* [Metis Andromeda](https://www.metis.io/ecosystem-partners/) – A fork of Optimism, Metis has set out to be a home for DAOs so that they can more seamlessly cooperate with each other and with the broader digital economy. They currently share all of the drawbacks of Optimism, although there is a METIS token available. 
* [Boba Network](https://boba.network/ecosystem/) – Another optimistic rollup made with forked code from Optimism, Boba is built by the Enya team at the OMG foundation. They share the same vulnerabilities as the other Optimism forks, and like Metis they do have a token (BOBA). It’s still relatively early days for Boba, and it remains to be seen how well they stack up against competitors since they’re also aiming to be a general-purpose L2. 
* [ZKSwap](https://www.zks.org/) – Similar to Loopring, ZKSwap is designed to be a validity-proof-based L2 DEX with transfers and an NFT marketplace. There are subtle differences in the tech design of ZKSwap vs. Loopring which I won’t get into here. ZKSwap does have an 8-day delay on updates and an operational escape hatch function, and it also has a token (ZKS). Edit: As the comments point out, ZKSwap is a direct fork of zkSync. 
* [zkSync](https://zksync.io/) – Created by Matter Labs, zkSync is aiming to be a major player in the zkEVM space. Their current product “zkSync 1.0” is available today with transfers/trades and limited NFT functionality, but 2.0 is in testnet which is aiming to have full EVM compatibility. ZkSync is arguably one of the safest rollups currently with a 14-day delay on code updates and an operational escape hatch should the operator go down. There is currently no token, although zkSync has confirmed that they intend to move to community governance in the future. Fees are generally under $1 for transfers. 
* [Aztec](https://zk.money/) – Also known as zk.money, Aztec is the only operational rollup aiming to be a privacy network. Currently zk.money 1.0 is live and available for “shielding” transactions, and they plan to launch 2.0 in 2022 along with “decentralization”. If they’re able to achieve EVM compatibility, you could essentially have monero-like privacy while using Ethereum-based assets and apps. They currently have some of the strongest rollup security with zk.money 1.0, although it is limited to simple payments. 
* [Polygon](https://polygon.technology/get-started/) – Everybody knows about the MATIC sidechain (commit-chain?) but you might not know that Polygon is also a tech leader in the zk-rollup space. They’ve acquired several cutting-edge teams and are developing several projects such as Miden, Nightfall, Zero, and Hermez. Their operational zk rollup product is Hermez, which only performs simple payments at the moment and has some compromises in terms of security. It’s unclear whether the MATIC token will have a role to play in the rollup economy, but Polygon itself is likely to be around for a long time as they’ve developed important tech in the space.

Hopefully I’ve given each major rollup a fair summary. I highly recommend reading the information on l2beat.com to understand where each rollup stands in terms of adoption and security. If you’d like to try one out, evaluate your own security needs relative to the value of your investment, and proceed accordingly. If you find an ecosystem you enjoy, pay close attention to it! New things are happening nearly every day in this space and staying abreast of all the updates is like drinking from a firehose. 

If you have questions, comments, or concerns please leave a comment and I’ll be happy to expand on what I’ve written.",39.0,2022-01-14 13:40:38,0.9

This is a great way for them to make tons of money quickly themselves. This is partially the main reason why you'll see the uniswap router dump tons of amounts of eth in their projects also. The excuse when the dump/rugs happen is usually ""the devs ran off"" Or ""lost the keys."" Then they move on to a new project, Don't be fooled by their locked liquidity tactics either because they use ""presale"" to stock up on coins as well as other methods like sniping their own project. Don't be fooled by a large quantity of holders, they airdrop thousands of people to fluff numbers and use tons of bots for telegram subscribers. They can afford to do anything as they've scammed for millions of dollars. They've launched many different projects, from ACCEL, Ascend token, Shunav1,Shuna v2, levelup, weGrow, boombabyio, to matrix samurai, peeps, Bezoge, Arena, HODL, fkemax, viceX and many many others. Serenity is coming up, another scam. The owner, justin Maher has been served by the sec, resigned from northwestern mutual as an financial advisor, and caused all of Ethereummax's issues being the founder that took part in the launch and obtained hundreds of trillions of tokens at that time. I really want to help make this world a better place and stop people like this from destroying the industry. They have many moderators they pay in tokens that will pretend they're fans of these projects, even after they rug. I'm shocked they never get upset. Justin Maher is a master manipulator and I have fell for his lies many times, but Accel was the last lie I'll fall for. I've learned my lesson in the erc20 world thanks to people like Justin Maher and Russ Davis (inRussWetrust crypto group on facebook), I quickly learned in Russ we don't trust...

It’s time to stop using seed phrases. Do you agree?,"I know, you are probably thinking, *""What the f\*ck are you talking about? How am I supposed to recover my non-custodial wallet without a seed phrase?""*

Let me explain…

We all agree that getting a non-custodial wallet is the safest way to store cryptos. Not your keys, not your crypto, right?

What I totally disagree though, is using a seed phrase as the only means to recover our non-custodial wallets.

The reason is simple.

People keep losing their seed phrase and getting scammed every day. 

You might think, ""It's their fault for being dumb. Not our business.""

Well, this is not the case. It is absolutely our business.

If we really want cryptos to grow and be adopted by everyone, we need an easier way for people to own their digital assets. 

Furthermore, while you might have not compromised your seed phrase yet, the risk of phishing and losing it is extremely high even for experienced users.

Vitalik Buterin himself wrote a piece on this, titled ""Why we need wide adoption of social recovery wallets.""

In it, he explains that we need a wallet that is easy to use and that has no single point of failure (there is no single thing that, if stolen, can give an attacker access to your funds, or if lost, can deny you access to your funds.) 

At Linen Wallet, we've built exactly this type of non-custodial wallet. A wallet that is both safer and easier than standard self-custody wallets. Here's how it works:

* No single point of failure: Using a smart contract, the wallet is secured with 3 keys, 2 of which are required to make a transaction. You lose one? You can still access your wallet. Someone steals one? They still can't access it.
* Simple keys management: One key is stored in your cloud, one in your mobile device, and one in Linen's secure server infrastructure. (More options will be available in future versions)
* No seed phrase: You can seamlessly recover your wallet using your cloud drive, email, and phone number.

ZK Technology comparison: ZK-Snarks (Loopring) vs ZK-Starks (Starkware),"First of all why do we focus on ZK Technologies?

Because Vitaliks said so:  


>In general, my own view is that in the short term, optimistic rollups are likely to win out for general-purpose EVM computation and ZK rollups are likely to win out for simple payments, exchange and other application-specific use cases, **but in the medium to long term ZK rollups will win out in all use cases as ZK-SNARK technology improves**.

**What does ZK mean?**

**Defintion:**  
In cryptography, a **zero-knowledge proof** or **zero-knowledge protocol** is a method by which one party (the prover) can prove to another party (the verifier) that a given statement is true while the prover avoids conveying any additional information apart from the fact that the statement is indeed true.

**ZK = Scaling + Privacy**  
They are both a privacy enhancing technology, as they reduce the amount of information that needs to be provided between users, and a scaling technology, since they can allow proofs to be verified at a faster rate because they don’t contain the full amount of information for non-private systems. 

**BUT...**

Newer ZK Technologies like ZK Starks are out!  
The general consensus is that they are better than ZK Snarks.  
Because of that I would like to keep an open mind and compare both technologies.

# ZK-SNARK

Stands for zero-knowledge succinct **non-interactive** argument of knowledge.  
First paper in 2012.  
ZK-SNARKs at their base depend upon elliptic curves for their security.

**Protocols:**

* Loopring
* Polygon Hermez
* ZKSync
* ZKSwap

**Pros:**  
\+ Smaller proof size  
\+ Smaller verification time  
\+ Bigger developer community and libraries (longer in the game)

**Cons:**  
\- Require trusted setup (honest participants needed)  
\- Longer prover time  
\- Not secure by quantum computers  
\- Stong crypto assumptions  
*(The weaker the assumptions of a model, the stronger the model. Relaxing an assumption is to go from a strong to a weak, more realistic, assumption.)*

# ZK-STARK

Stands for zero-knowledge scalable **transparent** argument of knowledge.  
First paper in 2018.  
STARKs rely on hash functions.

**Protocols:**

* Starkware/StarkEx
* Immutable X (StarkEx)
* DYDX (StarkEx)
* Starknet
* Polygon Miden

**Pros:**  
\+ Quantum resistant  
\+ Assumptions: Collision resistant hashes (less likely to be attacked)  
\+ No trusted setup required  
\+ Vocal support from Ethereum foundation  
\+ More scalable in terms of computational speed

**Cons:**  
\- Far larger proof size = more gas  
\- Small developer community because it is new

Below, we have a couple tables depicting some of the high-level differences between the two technologies.

# Lessons to learn:

While ZK Snark are currently more popular and also mentioned by Vitalik I would like to suggest everyone to keep an open mind about other technologies.

ZK Starks do not need a trusted setup and are generally more secure.  
On the downside the verfication cost is orders of magnitudes higher!!  
Currently this is the killer but if the verfication cost can be reduced

......ZK Starks can be very serious competition.

**Now who uses what?**

l2beat.com gives an good overview of all relevant L2's.

* **ZK Stark protocols are marked in blue** (all use Starkware)*Starkware uses Volition: This is a hybrid of ZK Rollups and Validiums. This gives the user the freedom to chose the technology based on their preference. (Cost, Security, Scalability)*
* **ZK Snark protocols are marked in green**

**Frequently Asked Questions**

**Where's the best place to buy ETH?**

There are many centralized exchanges that support Ethereum. If you live in the US, the most popular exchanges are Coinbase, Gemeni and Kraken. Coinbase users can use Coinbase Pro for lower fees.

**When is Eth2 launching?**

Eth2 is a marketing term used to represent a number of updates to Ethereum. The Eth2 proof-of-stake chain first launched in December 2020. ""The Merge"", which is the event that will fully switch Ethereum's consensus to proof-of-stake, is estimated to be ready in early 2022, although there is no exact timeline. Other updates, such as data shards, will follow that update.

Visit [ethmerge.com](https://ethmerge.com/) to learn more about ""The Merge"".

**Do I need to do anything to update to Eth2? Will Eth2 create a new token?**

No, ETH holders *never* need to take any action to keep holding ETH. Ethereum users will be unaffected by the Eth2 upgrade. And the Eth2 updates will not create any new tokens.

**How can I stake my ETH?**

There are two ways that you can stake your ETH: by running your own validator, or providing your ETH to a staking pool.

* Running your own validator requires a modern computer and 32 ETH. Visit /r/ethstaker for more details
* Staking pools accept any amount of ETH. We recommend [Lido](https://lido.fi/) or [StakeWise](https://stakewise.io/)

**Why are Ethereum transaction fees so high?**

Like most blockchains, Ethereum fees are determined by supply-and-demand. The large demand to use Ethereum has pushed transaction fees quite high (however, fees were just a few cents only 2 years ago). Fees are especially high during market volatility, and during NFT drops.

**What is being done to lower Ethereum transaction fees?**

Ethereum fees are reduced by using layer-2 rollups. Rollups are scaling solutions that allow for significantly cheaper transactions, while still maintaining Ethereum's security.

Additionally, Eth2's data shards will make rollups even cheaper.

While rollups are cutting-edge technology being actively developed, a number are already live on Ethereum mainnet. Visit [l2beat.com](https://l2beat.com/) to learn more about rollups.

**What's the best wallet for Ethereum?**

The most popular tool for using decentralized applications is Metamask. However, for security reasons, we recommend using a hardware wallet such as a Trezor or Ledger.

Let's discuss NFT's real use cases in real life both physical and virtual,"I am tired of the current NFT hype and I am trying to see the real uses cases for this technology. Any idea guys? The template I propose shall be the following:

1. Problem: What problem does it solve
2. Type of improvement: **better**? **cheaper**? **faster**? than traditional sollutions",58.0,2022-01-09 21:46:46,0.83
so tired of NFT’s,"is anyone else getting really tired of these money grubbing NFT maxis? I swear everywhere I look there’s new projects or people flexing their collections and exuberant wealth (which they arguably did nothing to gain other than let celebs or newcomers pump their floor prices). Honestly in all of my years in crypto, despite having been involved in probably 100+ unique projects/tokens/ecosystems - I’ve never seen such toxic people as the NFT maxi communities. It’s like each one is a little annoying cult and all they want to do is remind everyone else of how much money they have and how valuable their “collections” are. Tbh it gives NFT’s and crypto a bad name in my book. 

Meanwhile Avalanche is partnering with Deloitte to provide emergency disaster insurance - and Chainlink has integrated their oracles to be used by farmers for smart contract-based disaster insurance. These are the use cases that can and are going to actually change the world - and yet these NFT maximalists are the ones hogging the spotlight (and congesting networks) all in the name of wanting to get rich and flex to everyone how smart they are and how they’ve mastered the art of trading because they got lucky buying a jpeg. I swear we’re going to have a wave of people claiming to be professional crypto consultants purely because they got lucky over borderline Ponzi schemes. I am welcoming a crypto winter at this point just to see these annoying groups crash

EDIT: Yeah I’m talking about purely “digital art” NFT’s where it’s jpegs being hosted on a (not even decentralized) server or marketplace account. Like worthless PFP projects. I have no doubt NFT’s of insurance policies (I.e. my Avalanche/Deloitte example) will be the future. DID, insurance, patents, healthcare policies, passports, visas, ticketing, unique allergy profiles, licenses, legal contracts. All of this is the future and I happily welcome it.

web3 censorship,"So I'm late coming to the blockchain party but I've been doing a deep, comprehensive dive over the past month or so from the perspective of a developer. I find it all fascinating and definitely see the paradigm shifting nature of a decentralized web3, especially when it comes to disrupting the tech and financial giants that dominate so much of the global economy. Good on all of that.

Here's the issue I'm running into: Last night I finally got around to checking out [mirrror.xyz](https://mirrror.xyz). A decentralized blog, something great in the face of totalitarian censorship. It made me think about the Chinese woman who a few years ago posted some bombshell article or accusation onto the blockchain so it could not be censored. I forget the details but that's a fantastic use case for a decentralized publishing platform. I dug into the details of [mirror.xyz](https://mirror.xyz) to learn exactly how much of the site is decentralized versus blockchain-enabled. (See [Moxie Marlinspike's blog entry](https://moxie.org/2022/01/07/web3-first-impressions.html).) This is where I learned how [mirror.xyz](https://mirror.xyz) uses Arweave to store its data, a truly decentralized and uncensorable data solution. (My first look into web3 data storage.)

Awesome. But I see problems with an uncensorable future because there are definitely instances of censorship that the *vast* majority of people support: child porn, violence/torture, blackmail. Tech companies expend a huge amount of effort in conducting this censorship. Hell, even this subreddit includes a form of censorship assuming the moderators ever take an active role in curating the community.

I appreciate the desire for freedom of expression when it comes to politics and culture so let's table that debate and agree to a completely uncensored discourse. But it doesn't take much to go down the dark road of content that makes one cringe at the ability to inject something into the public record that can never be taken down and is freely accessible by anyone looking to connect to it and broadcast it.

Again, I'm new in my exploration of web3 but I haven't read much discussion about how to address this issue. The best I've seen is that KYC will prevent people from posting things they won't want to have connected to them. But that strikes me as a form of disingenuous hand waving when privacy and anonymity is so often held up as a virtue of web3. And regardless, KYC has to be chosen and implemented by the file storage provider. Or is this even true? If it's a decentralized storage blockchain, can't one just submit a transaction with the offending content and be done with it? Even if not, how long until there's a 100% privacy ensured storage option created that allows unfettered posting  of content.

Happy to learn what I'm missing.",22.0,2022-01-08 21:51:57,0.87
Any Blockchain projects that are trying to disrupt state governance?,"Other than financial aspects like banking and economics, there are various other aspects of life which the governments handle. This could be healthcare, education, and things related to physical public assets like roads, etc. 

**Are there any projects that are trying to disrupt these aspects using blockchain?** Like something that someone pools public funds in a decentralised way to build public physical assets while the public has the power to vote like in a DAO.

Smart contract wallet may be the key to mass adoption,"Bc Argent has this features:
* No awkward seed phrase
* L2 by default (zkSync)
* Fiat-on-ramp
* Username
* Simple UI

Currently defi protocol Curve and Unisync (fork of uniswap v2) are live on ZkSync testnet. Matterlabs also has a roadmap to enable privacy on ZkSync

Basically Argent is the DeFi version of PayPal but more secure, permissionless, trustless, with a flat-transparent-crystal-clear-innocent fee

If there's another Smart Contract Wallet built on L2 and you can bridge funds to ZkSync, then I guess it's just like sending money from Paypal to Cashapp/Venmo/Square

Last but not least, according to L2fees, current tx fee on ZkSync is only $0.42, which is still more expensive than other alt L1, but already much more cheaper than most of international/domestc tx on TradFi

Western Union: $5 to 70 (Depends on tx amount, finalized in minutes)

Commonwealth: $2 to 5 AUD or 3% 

UBS: $0.3 to 5 CHF

Paypal: $0.3 to 4.99

Reminder: Crypto is Not Here To Make You RICH. Crypto is Here To Make You FREE," **Introduction: Opportunity for Wealth in the Cryptoverse**

Nowhere else on Earth will you find similar types of gains in the cryptoverse. It is a fact, that the opportunity for wealth here is so immense that it creates dreams of unprecedented wealth even for those with a common life. Combine this with explosive price actions and hype, lots of attention and adoption are drawn into the space on a regular basis, making it one of the fastest-growing sectors in the entire human existence.

However, while everybody thinks crypto is the go-to place to make millions, it is also where entire financial life and fortune are ruined and lost. As a nascent space, crypto is warned with a lot of risks, even in a bull market, yet it is intriguing to see people pilling themselves up, thinking this is the only opportunity to escape the rat race and hence better their life. This kind of mentality does make me wonder what the hell is wrong with the current world we are all living in.

&#x200B;

**The Reality of The Current System**

The truth is you can’t blame them. In the legacy system, so much wrongs are to be found that clouded their ability to judge and search for opportunities. People are enslaved to the system, both in the physical and in the digital world. They live most of their life in accordance to the work and spend cycle, conforming and following the exact same path of life as everybody else under the promise of security and happiness. In exchange, they have to give up their freedom to those who stay in the highest positions of power.

Either by forces or by influences, every human society trends toward a structure with a few in control of the majority. While this is natural to the existence of human beings, it is also what creates much of the sufferings and injustice we see throughout all human history. Being power-hungry and driven creatures, we form hierarchical structures to ensure the best cooperation between each other, yet when societies and networks expand beyond our consciousness, power tends to overconcentrate in entities that then often become corrupted, oppressive and unaccountable.

&#x200B;

**Centralization of Power and Human Nature**

Reflecting on this, we can see the same presence in some of the strongest nations in the world today. When power is abused by a centralized entity, someone must suffer. If not those at the top, the price will have to be paid by those at the bottom, and this is often the case. We see this time and time over again, with the final fate of most society leading towards intolerance, civil war and eventually the collapse of the entire system.

The same can be said to the digital society today, though the difference is those in positions of power are untouchable and divine. They play the role of Gods, influencing the lives of millions and billions each year without us having a voice-over, yet we all have come to accept it because we have no other choice.

Despite all of these, people are still chasing the same damn things that make them slaves in the old system. Thinking by somehow riching off from crypto or any new innovation will make them more free and live more comfortably. This is only a delusion painted by the lies of consumerism and power-hungry culture. In a centralized system, you are neither free nor rich, you are either the few powerful or the majority powerless.

&#x200B;

**Faith in The New System**

Understanding this is the first step in understanding why the world of crypto is so disruptive and why the opportunity for wealth here is so real. Wealth does not magically exist. It comes with and from people who came collectively with the same mindset, same vision and set out to do the same goal: to make a difference in the world, to build something that breaks away from the power structure of the legacy system and to create a place where fairness and freedom lie at the heart of the system.

Crypto was never made to make you RICH. Crypto was made to make you FREE. This is the vision of Satoshi for what a decentralized, trustless, permissionless and censorship-resistant system would bring to the future of humanity: A world where we all have a choice, to either give away control of our life to someone else or be the one who dictates our own fate.

Many of us realized we do not need banks, institutions and corporations to be our responsible. Many of us realized we do not need centralized entities to tell us what to do and what not to do with our life. Many of us realized that we can decide things for ourselves, and that is something we are not offered in the current system. With crypto, we have A CHOICE, and as there exists a demand for having this choice, the market responds with growth and opportunity to where it is offered.

&#x200B;

**Becoming Successful In The Cryptoverse**

Understanding this is crucial to becoming successful in the space. Those who do not stick around will never win big or win at all because their minds are still plugged into the old system. The biggest winners of the space are those who understand the value proposition and turn themselves to this beautiful vision and dedicate their lives to make it a reality either through long-term capitals, through their voices and their words or through their own hands.

Without courage, there is no freedom. Without freedom, there is no opportunity. What is offered as protection in the centralized world is in disguise of restriction, to limit the rate of innovation and revolution that are happening through crypto. They will doubt our success and they will question our authenticity to change the world. But we show them why we are better and why we had to be better, and by believing and dedicating to this space, we ultimately win by bringing equal opportunities to all human beings, while expanding the potentials of human kinds instead of limiting them like in the legacy system.

&#x200B;

**TLDR: Conclusion**

Those who understand the purpose of the cryptoverse will ultimately understand the opportunity for wealth that comes with it. And for as long as we, the people, come together to push it into existence, crypto will not be a single opportunity but an opportunity of a lifetime for all of us human beings. Crypto is here to stay.

Damn... Polygon lack of balance/allowance check fixed. $2.2M payout to whitehat.,"Props to Polygon for the rapid response and the wh for the report.

""Whitehat Leon Spacewalker reported a critical vulnerability in Polygon on December 3. The vulnerability consisted of a lack of balance/allowance check in the transfer function of Polygon’s MRC20 contract and would have allowed an attacker to steal all ~9,276,584,332 MATIC (as of December 5, the date of the fix) from that contract. Following the report from Leon Spacewalker, Polygon immediately sprang into action to fix the bug. Immunefi assisted in investigating blockchain activity, validating the fix, and advising the hardfork operation.""

No, ETH holders *never* need to take any action to keep holding ETH. Ethereum users will be unaffected by the Eth2 upgrade. And the Eth2 updates will not create any new tokens.

**How can I stake my ETH?**

There are two ways that you can stake your ETH: by running your own validator, or providing your ETH to a staking pool.

* Running your own validator requires a modern computer and 32 ETH. Visit /r/ethstaker for more details
* Staking pools accept any amount of ETH. We recommend [Lido](https://lido.fi/) or [StakeWise](https://stakewise.io/)

**Why are Ethereum transaction fees so high?**

Like most blockchains, Ethereum fees are determined by supply-and-demand. The large demand to use Ethereum has pushed transaction fees quite high (however, fees were just a few cents only 2 years ago). Fees are especially high during market volatility, and during NFT drops.

**What is being done to lower Ethereum transaction fees?**

Ethereum fees are reduced by using layer-2 rollups. Rollups are scaling solutions that allow for significantly cheaper transactions, while still maintaining Ethereum's security.

Additionally, Eth2's data shards will make rollups even cheaper.

While rollups are cutting-edge technology being actively developed, a number are already live on Ethereum mainnet. Visit [l2beat.com](https://l2beat.com/) to learn more about rollups.

**What's the best wallet for Ethereum?**

The most popular tool for using decentralized applications is Metamask. However, for security reasons, we recommend using a hardware wallet such as a Trezor or Ledger.

Why is eth still being used despite high gas prices?,"Not a troll post. Genuinely here to ask why.

I personally do not transact or move ethereum based tokens because of gas prices. I'll use xlm to transfer cash or move things around using avalanche, Solana, and chains simply because I don't want to pay such high gas prices.

Now my question is this - there are many alternatives at the moment outside of ethereum. Why would anyone still use ethereum despite having such high gas fees? Would everyone just move to chains that are cheaper?

Is there something I'm missing?",20.0,2022-01-03 00:59:21,0.64

The Moral Case for Web3,"This is going to be somewhat lengthy so buckle up. There is a big jar of 🪙crypto at the end of the 🌈 rainbow ;)  


Recently a group of important voices have come out against Web3. These aren’t the usual technology adverse critics but rather voices that are in general pro technological innovation; People like Jack Dorsey and Tim O’Reilly but also others like Levi from Box.com and large parts of the entire gaming community also seems to have an issue with the fundamental morality of the Web3 project.

This should be taken seriously but instead of getting into a tit-for-tat with their claims I would like to zoom out a little bit more and try to explain why Web3 is not just a great technical innovation, it’s also morally superior to any societal solution we currently have, rendering the objections by critics moot.

Let's start with the obvious question: Why do we need a moral case for blockchain?

The answer is actually quite simple.

Any claimed solution to a problem, potentially affecting humans at large scale, need to to deliver on at least 4 axises.

* Non-coercive
* Fundamental
* Transparent
* Better problems

**Non-coercive**

A moral solution doesn't need to be forced, it will prove itself by improving the circumstances for those embracing it. Only through volunteer adoption can a solution said to be moral.

**Non-exclusive**

People who adopt the solution later aren't in principle excluded from participating in the upside early adopters enjoyed. Early adopters aren't in shielded from the downside of those adopting late.

**Transparent**

A morally superior system is not afraid of its own logic or the axioms it's built upon. In fact the superiority hinges on the accessibility of the rules and the reasoning governing the system.

**Better problems**

There is no such thing as a perfect solution.

All solutions come with their own unique problems.

The crucial difference is whether those problems are better problems to have than those it replaced.

**Ok but what problems does Web3/Crypto actually solve?**

At its core crypto solves the problem of trust.

This might sound underwhelming but once you start thinking about how many things in society are based on trust you quickly realize how important solutions to this problem are.

Trust in your friends, trust in your colleagues, trust in local government, federal, police, legal system, neighborhood, financial system, economic policies, the market, companies, ownership, your self! I could go on.

Nothing work without trust...

However trust isn't itself enough, trust needs a mechanism to function.

Very few relationships can be self-governed and require some sort of non-partisan transparent mediator to ensure that people with different, often opposing interest can trust the outcomes affecting them.

The magnum opus of this effort is the 3 branches of government separating the legislative, executive and judicial powers plus an error correcting mechanism through regular elections ensuring representation of everyones interests at least in theory.

The ingenuity of this invention historically cannot be emphasized enough. It's trough this, we've been able to build the myriad of institutions locally, nationally and internationally.

It's ensured an equilibrium of trust between non-trusting parties.

At least until now.

All systems have a limit to how much they can scale, be internally consistent and still effective.

With the advent of globalization through the use of technology, the sheer scale of ""cases"" that require mediation through 3rd parties is nothing short of a Cambrian explosion.

The current system, built post 2nd world war worked  when there were few banks, airlines, academics and no home computers.

It wasn't made for millions of investors, dronepilots, 100's of millions of academics and billions of smartphone users able to retrieve and collaborate.

There is so much information, so many perspectives and competing interests (obvious and non-obvious) at ods with each other that it's impossible for anyone to even understand a fraction of what is going on and thus more importantly to know what and who to trust.

This ever increasing opaqueness creates a fertile domestic and global breeding grund for special interest, gate keepers and intermediaries and erodes the ability for the system to stay honest where it matters.

If you agree that transparency and non-biased mediation is worth pursuing, if you agree that trust in our institutions is necessary, then the blockchain is the solution we've been needing.

Blockchain is the answer to a simple but important question:

*""How can we trust that a piece of information haven't been manipulated.""*

It does so through a public ledger whose entries are accessible and validated, not by any one organization or person, but by the network itself.

This network consist of nodes who's sole job it is to validate new entries into the ledger, incentivized by monetary gains for validation regardless of the specifics.

This has shown to be a very solid framework for non-biased validation, at scale and with efficiency.

Given the Turing Complete nature of smart contracts, any political, legal, international, organizational agreement/claim/process can be put ""on-chain"" without the ability for any one party to change the history of events and with the ability for everyone to validate.

Furthermore to the extent that more complex structures needs to be created, blockchain allow not only for governance but enforcement.

It solves all four previously mentioned criterion.

**It's non-coercive**

It can be implemented over time without destroying the current system. Instead a mirror of the existing system can be created and provide a better alternative with all the benefits described.

**It's non-exclusive.**

Because of the interoperable and permissionless structure of blockchain, everyone can participate or create their own alternatives to what exist.

Web3 doesn't benefit from network effect the way web2 do.

[https://twitter.com/Hello\_World/status/1470866414236061711](https://twitter.com/Hello_World/status/1470866414236061711)

**It's transparent**

Having an immutable publicly available ledger with every political claim, decision, process and event on-chain is the single most powerful tool against conspiring by the powerful against the powerless.

**It create better problems**

We can't create problem free solutions, but we can create better problems.

By solving the non-partisanship in mediation through network validation, transparency of governance and immutability of decisions, we can put our focus on better problems:

* Faster and more thorough legislation
* More contextually sensitive legal structure
* More nuanced decision making
* Faster decision making
* Fairer processes
* Previously impossible types of cooporation
* More quantifiable feedback loops
* Faster error correction

Blockchain as a framework for governance and enforcement is a more scalable, transparent and fairer system and allow us to further improve the advances already made by previous systems without having to destroy it first.

That's the moral case for web3.

P.S. This is the first draft of where I am going to spend my personal time in 2022. To take the criticism seriously and to address it head on with the intellectual honesty it  deserves. Hope the community will help do the same.

New Ethereum Skype/IRC Megabridge,"Hello!

Myself, Konstantin and Chris R have been working tirelessly over the last few days to successfully implement a Skype/IRC bridge (Microsoft's recent updates certainly didn't help).

This means now we can now link several Skype channels together along with IRC so that there is no longer a limit on the amount of people that can take part in Ethereum discussions :) We also hope to integrate Whisper based chat ÐApps in the future.

Now we are finished, we cordially invite everyone in the community to join the channel and partake in Ethereum discussions!

"I'm confident about Ethereum's technology but worried about the Official Dapps, especially the Dapp Store.","TL;DR: Ethereum's Official Dapps will define Ethereum for the mainstream and have more PR / image impact than the Ethereum's technology. And while the Ethereum tech is being thoroughly developed and tested, the Official Dapps don't seem to by fully thought out. 

I'm an early Ethereum enthusiast, ex-Googler (product & biz roles),  founder of the Ethereum community  in Wroclaw, Poland (first meetup in 04.2014, 70 people in the community right now  - (http://www.meetup.com/Ethereum-Meetup-Wroclaw/). I spoke publicly  during tech events advocating for blockchain 2.0 tech and Ethereum.

I've been following Ethereum closely from the very beginning and along with VR  I consider it one of the most revolutionary technologies out there right now. That was the reason I decided to go out there and start the community here in Poland. 

But once things got funded & formalised and the operation is getting set up (EthDev) , there are several issues that keep coming up that haven't been addressed by now. I believe these issues will grow in importance over time and addressing them now will help Ethereum org and the Ethereum community avoid misunderstandings in the future. 

Basically it comes down to the the type of organisation EthDev is or wants to become - is it a web 3.0 technology organisation or a web 3.0 product / dapp organisation?

Looking at EthDev org structure, level discussion around the technology & protocols,  I'm confident that Ethereum tech (the suite of protocols Ethereum + Swarm + Whisper, 3 separate implementations,  development tools etc ) will be top notch. Vitalik's insights into the consensus algorithms always blow my mind too. Ethereum attracted some of the best technical talents in the cryptospace and kudos for that.

However, I'm a bit worried about the emerging products built internally on top of Ethereum - especially the Mist browser + Ethereum Catalog bundle. We've seen Dapp Store mockups which look awesome from the UI design point of view but the conversation about hte most important aspects such as ranking algos, identity,  trust models, spam prevention is missing.

Building a decentralised dapp store is an enormous undertaking - and if we're launching in march 2015 there's not much time left. 

So why I'm so worried? 

Because official products such as Ethereum Catalog will define Ethereum to the wider audience and will have more PR / perception impact than Solidity or IDE tools. In the same way  iPhone was defined by it's first applications and not by technical qualities of Objective C or Cocoa. 

And this catalog will be attacked and spammed to hell from day 1. Look at the early days of Google Search, Apple App Store etc to see how much spam there was and these two were centralised platforms with internal anti-spam teams.

A simple test: 'what if on day 1 -  in the official Dapp Store - the top 3 dapps are for underage porn and contain suggestive thumbnails' ? Can anyone take them down? If so, why? Based on what rules etc? Because if it's possible - someone will do it for sure only to damage Ethereum. If MtGox goes down, Bitcoin is still fine. If the official Ethereum Catalog gets spammed, technically the Ethereum blockchain is still fine. But the perception is different because it's the same org that created both. 

History is full of examples of great technologies that flop due to poor product decisions. Anyone remembers Google Wave? A great technological achievement that was packaged into a poorly designed product. 

So when I read about various aspects of potential attacks in Vitalik's blog posts and see the effort & talent dedicated to building the protocol -  I know that Ethereum's blockchain will be safe. 

But the conversation about official (EthDev built) Dapps & their implication for the ecosystem is non-existent. 

What are the solutions then? To me it's either forming a dedicated EthDapp team responsible for official products/Dapps (can be non-profit) or going live without official dapps (catalog, people etc) altogether and leaving them to be built by the community.

If the difference between 'product company vs technology company'  is still not clear to you - read this article http://www.gamasutra.com/blogs/TrentOster/20100810/87837/Product_Companies_Vs_Technology_Companies.php 

Please convince me I'm wrong and there's nothing to be worried about :)

Building a Linux Virtual Machine for use with Alethzero Client,"Using a VM in concert with the Ethereum client is highly recommended as it allows developers to avoid the frequent compatability issues which come with building a pre-alpha client, while freeing them up to switch between builds simply and with few technical problems.

In order to help you use the software we have built a Virtual Machine and made it available to download over torrent. It contains a stable version of the POC7 client and will be compatible with our upcoming tutorials. [You can download it using this Magnet link:

magnet:?xt=urn:btih:524BADD3FC667452DDE3E7A72F67B86D261AAAE8&dn=Ethereum%20VM&tr=http%3a%2f%2fwww.sumotracker.com%2fannounce&tr=http%3a%2f%2fopen.tracker.thepiratebay.org%2fannounce&tr=http%3a%2f%2fwww.torrent-downloads.to%3a2710%2fannounce&tr=http%3a%2f%2fdenis.stalker.h3q.com%3a6969%2fannounce&tr=udp%3a%2f%2fdenis.stalker.h3q.com%3a6969%2fannounce

This VM was created using VMWare fusion 7 and tested for compatibility with vmware workstation 10 - both of which are available as a thirty day free trial from vmware.com. At it's base is a clean install of the latest version of Ubuntu Linux. All dependencies for Alethzero were installed in stages, with snapshots taken to allow users to revert to previous sytems states in order to troubleshoot. It currently has a working version of the Alethzero client installed which has been tested to work with the latest tutorials.

After installing the VM and importing the VM files included in the torrent, you should start up the VM and be confronted with an ubuntu login page - the password is 'password' and you will find a shortcut to the Alethzero client located on the desktop. If at any time you wish to revert back to the state the vm was in when you downloaded it just select the snapshot ""Alethzero installed"" and click restore.

It is possible to create your own vm, by first downloading the software from the vmware website, creating a VM using Ubuntu linux, and then following the instructions on our [building in ubuntu wiki](https://github.com/ethereum/cpp-ethereum/wiki/Building-on-Ubuntu).

**The process of constructing *this* vm is detailed below so that you might follow it yourself if you would prefer not to download our (rather large) torrent.**

1\. Download VMWARE fusion or workstation trial from the VMware website.

2\. Download the Ubuntu disc image (ISO) from the ubuntu website

3\. Once VMware is downloaded open the file and follow the installation instructions. Run the program and select File> New and create a virtual machine. Choose to create it from a 'disc or image' and select the Ubuntu ISO you downloaded previoulsy. Choose install and setup your vm as you would like it. **make sure you specify the VM has at least 2GB of memory or the build of alethzero will fail.**

4\.Once ubuntu is installed you will want to update your package manager. Open the terminal and type:
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade

5\. Now return to your host sytem and find the vmware window go to Virtual Machine > install VMWare tools. This will mount a cd containing files needed by linux to use the hosts sytems hardware and copy paste between your host system and your vm. Go back to your vm and navigate to the drive marked vmware tools - extract the vmware tar ball to the desktop. Then return to the terminal and input:

cd Desktop/vmware-tools-distrib

sudo ./vmware-install.pl -d

6\. Shutdown and take a snaphot of your vm to revert to later.

7\. Start-up your vm and you should now find that you can alter the size of the screen and copy paste between your host and the vm. If you cant google vmware tools and see if you can trouble shoot what went wrong.

8\.You now have the base to install the dependencies for Alethzero. Start by entering the below in the terminal:

sudo apt-get install build-essential g++-4.8 git cmake libgmp-dev \
libboost-all-dev automake unzip libtool libleveldb-dev yasm libminiupnpc-dev \
libreadline-dev scons libncurses5-dev qtbase5-dev qt5-default qtdeclarative5-dev \
libqt5webkit5-dev \
libcurl4-openssl-dev libjsoncpp-dev libargtable2-dev libboost-test-dev cmake

9\. Shutdown and take a snapshot ;)

10\.Now add the cryptopp dependencies:

git clone https://github.com/mmoss/cryptopp.git

cd cryptopp

sudo scons --shared --prefix=/usr

cd ..

11\. Shutdown and take a snapshot :p

12\. Install the JSONRPC library - currently we are using an older version which may not be compatible with future builds. Make sure you check for updates on the 'building on ubuntu' wiki if you experience issues with the javascript api:

git clone https://github.com/cinemast/libjson-rpc-cpp

cd libjson-rpc-cpp

git reset --hard eaca2481e2889d5a5b748383fb02b1d395969cd4

mkdir -p build

cd build

cmake .. && make

sudo make install   #Not required, but makes it easier to use

sudo ldconfig       #only required for linux

cd ../../

13\.  Shutdown and take a snapshot :p

14\. Install Unittests: 

git clone https://github.com/ethereum/tests

cd tests

git checkout develop

cd ..

15\. Shutdown and take a snapshot (doh).

16\. Now you are going to clone the cpp-ethereum develop git:

git clone https://github.com/ethereum/cpp-ethereum

cd cpp-ethereum

git checkout develop

On this build we have used commit e81197606ae29c4be3ac37ad4e8aaf699fbcd039 if you would like to use this commit also use command:

git reset --hard e81197606ae29c4be3ac37ad4e8aaf699fbcd039

17\. Inside the cpp-ethereum folder you will create a build folder and run the build process:

mkdir build

cd build 

cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release && make

18\. Once completed shutdown and take a snapshot.

19\. Voila! you now have a Linux VM with a copy of the Alethzero client running. This is an optimal approach to development during the pre-alpha stage with new versions of the client being released daily - you can try new builds and features without sacrificing a stable development environment.",27.0,2014-11-23 09:08:57,0.89

"BitShares guy here. Sorry we caused such a stir. We are not evil/greedy, Dan just sucks at PR.","* Dan has a way of posting ""optimistic"" posts that make proposals sound like reality. No shady backroom deals were made. Dan was excited about how much Vitalik agreed about nearly everything they discussed (DPOS rocks, some mechanics deserve to be first-class, there needs to be interface standardization, etc).

* Any talks of ""partnerships"" that we make are *necessarily* unofficial because there is no single organization managing funding and there is no one-time allocation for a single blockchain (plus the fact that all code is open source and anybody can copy anything anyway). The fact that this is not true for ethereum means the notion of ""partnership"" has much bigger consequences for you guys than for us. We should have realized and phrased our intent accordingly.

* None of us want to take away your ether stake from any of you. Any *potential* talk of reallocating ether stake was away from miners who would be diluting you anyway, but we did not expect ethereans to still be such strong supporters of POW and so this proposal was obviously premature. The value proposition here is aligned incentives from a few thousand more crypto 2.0 enthusiasts - we hope to prove this vale to all other crypto communities with our several subsequent DACs.

* Many of you do not think BitSharesX will work and many ethereans still confuse BTSX with bitshares as a whole. Many projects are not as ""controversial"" and we hope these will be an opportunity for ethereans to learn what we're actually all about (plug: PTS snapshot on the 21st for DNS and Voting DACs).

Introducing EtherEx: A decentralized cryptocurrency exchange,"Hello everyone,    
    
Today we are excited to introduce the community to a ground breaking decentralized cryptocurrency exchange, EtherEx.  We believe everyone deserves an exchange with open, verifiable transactions and it is our goal to finally provide that service.  No longer will centralized exchanges be the focal point of the crypto community, casting negative shadows on worldwide adoption.  It's time for a change.

###What  
EtherEx is a decentralized, open source cryptocurrency exchange built on the Ethereum blockchain using smart contracts.  Due to the incorporation of the blockchain technology, every trade will be open and verifiable.  Beyond just cryptocoins, EtherEx plans to offer more advanced financial trading abilities in the future which will handle items such as stocks, commodities, and more.

###Why  
Over the past few years, Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies have been gaining in popularity at an unprecedented rate. However, one area still demanding innovation and clarity is that of cryptocurrency exchanges. Currently, all but a few exchanges are centralized, going against the mission of the community which is that of decentralization. If users wish to trade upon these platforms they have to entrust strangers to hold their cryptocurrency, fiat and identity documents. Many concerns come into play for users, whether it be the security of the website or what the exchange founders are doing with the funds.  A decentralized exchange removes the need for centralized companies to hold your funds, instead placing that trust on the Ethereum blockchain using peer to peer transactions.

###When  
The launch of our exchange relies heavily on the public launch of Ethereum itself, which at this point is slated for Q4 2014. Development is already in progress and EtherEx aims to go live on the same day.  

###Where can I find out more?  
Please visit our website at [http://etherex.org](http://etherex.org) for information and to sign up for our newsletter, through which we will be providing updates and future information on how to sign up for our private beta.  Also join us in #etherex on IRC for all discussions related to the project.

So you have:

a) a great interest in Ethereum

AND

b) a general disliking of the 29.4% premine/allocation/whatever

AND

c) publicly available [source code](https://github.com/ethereum)

I had to itch to scratch and I designed a concept UI for the AlephZero client,"Since using the AlephZero client I began thinking about how the client could look down the line, and once I had that itch I had to scratch it. 

http://cl.ly/image/1v2G102r0T3S/o

Of course this is a very rough sketch and shows only the contracts tab. I imagined it as a collection of all your active contracts, but added a few features that are not on the current code but seem no-brainer, specifically features in which a contract tells the client the kind of data it accepts (and what UI) and the current status of the client. 

I'm also adding the ability of querying a third party of your choosing to audit and describe each contract, so you can trust it before. 

Most features of the current AlephZero are visible on that screen. The ""owned accounts"" would be similar to the contracts page and the remaining status and blockchain could be tucked in the ""network"" screen. 

I'm using Retro gravatars to identify contracts because they're much more instantly recognizable than hashes, and I believe they are much better than the traditional ""kaleidoscope"" gravatars. I didn't pick or choose any, but you can still read an image in all of those random patterns.

So what does the community think? Is that kind of contribution welcome? How can I help in a more productive way?

"Vitalik on ""Hard Problems in Cryptocurrency"" at Silicon Valley Meetup","Update: added second video with audio overlaid on slides.

Vitalik Buterin spoke to the [Silicon Valley Ethereum meetup](http://www.meetup.com/EthereumSiliconValley/) on Sunday Mar 23rd on ""Hard Problems in Cryptocurrency"" which describes technical challenges that all crypto platforms from Bitcoin to Ethereum face.  This is a great presentation!  Here are a few links

What is the projected scalability of Ethereum compared to Bitcoin's current?,"I've heard that bitcoin needs a lot of trimming and work before it can begin to compete with Visa/Mastercard. I'm wondering what the Ethereum dev teams thoughts are on this issue. Given the ground up approach, is it something that will be a concern from the start, or will it be swept under the rug ""until we get there""? ",20.0,2014-02-12 20:33:41,0.87
Suggestion: Non Profit Foundation - Dev's Take Wages and Fame Only,"Gentleman,
first please accept my applause and gratitude for putting this together.

I understand now why Vitalik was too busy to talk in Vegas.

Amongst other things, you are on the verge of realising the ""sci fi"" distributed VM which I thought was so many years away (I mentioned it on the panel at the Singapore Bitcoin Conference).

Your work represents a fundamental new Internet protocol.

Unfortunately it appears to the outside observer, that you are taking a very short term commercial ""grab"" outlook on this.

Etherium is such a strong concept - it's doesn't need any smash and grab commercial tactics to succeed. 

Rather it needs the opposite - it needs a solid non competitive foundation at the helm suitable for building a Linux like ecosystem around this new protocol.

Much as I respect the team, it seems inevitable if you don't set up the underlying organisational mission and kernel, you will lose to someone who does.

For those of you who simply want a MSC like get rich quick - my request is going to be a hard sell.

However, for those of you who have followed free software and Linux, I appeal thusly:

1. Set up a not for profit foundation at the helm of Etherium
2. Clearly outline an ethical, free software based charter, and elect members accordingly
3. Take all funding raising into this NPO, limiting it to a pessimistic view of development, legal, and marketing costs (i.e. software always costs more than expected)
4. Use the funds on a costs basis to pay devs and other staff

I'm not suggesting the founders and devs take a pittance - rather I suggest taking a very healthy wage. Lets call it say 400-500K USD/ year.

Given the credentials of the team, clearly leading in this field, I don't think the community will blink an eyelid.

This won't make you 4.9 million overnight - but it will set you on a well paid career doing what you love most, in an organisation set up to succeed. Being absolute super stars of the Internet is just icing on top of the cake.

As someone with over 20 years off mixed open source and corporate experience, I feel can credibly state that free software, the Internet's protocols, and corporate interests are simply not a successful recipe for something as important, and foundational as Etherium.

My greatest fear is that some/ all of you have signed away your freedom already - in which case someone else, taking this approach, is likely going to be more influential in shaping future of the Internet.

Best Regards and Intentions,

Hugh Madden,
ANX

Welcome to Ethereum!,"Welcome to the Ethereum subreddit! 

Ethereum is a platform that makes it possible for any developer to write and distribute next-generation decentralized applications. Borrowing the concept of distributed consensus and cryptographic proof that makes cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin so effective in trustless payments, Ethereum extends the use of these technologies to trustless agreements. This allows developers to easily build innovative new products on a censorship and collusion-resistant foundation.  

Ethereum will go live in March 2015, in the meantime we are regularly releasing alpha software so you can try your hand at building distributed applications.

You won't believe what just happend,"‘Twas the night before Christmas, when all through the Net,  
Not a creature was stirring, not even a pet;  
The stocking were hung by the chimney with care,  
In hopes that St. Vitalik soon would be there;  
The geeks were nestled all snug in their beds,  
While visions of Ethereum danced in their heads;  

When out on reddit there arose such clatter,  
I sprang to my laptops to see what was the matter;  
Then seeing with my wandering eyes accidentally,  
A full blog post on understanding Serenity;  
With a prose so lively and quick,  
I knew in a moment he must be St. Vitalik;  

More rapid than eagles his coursers they came,  
And he whistled, and shouted, and called them by name:  
“Now, Wood! now, Zamfir, Now Jentzsch and Steiner!  
On, Tual, on Van De Sande, on Gerring and Vogelsteller,  

As I drew up my head, and was turning around,  
Down the chimney St. Vitalik came with a bound;  
He was slim and lean, a right jolly young elf,  
And I cheered when I saw him, in spite of myself;  
Dressed in a T-Shirt, with happy hat on,  
He explained it all, which took until dawn;  

Then laying his finger aside his nose,  
And giving a nod, up the chimney he rose;  
He sprang into action, proclaiming his plan,  
**Decentralize all the things as fast as you can!**  

Then I heard him exclaim, ere he drove out of sight -  
“Merry Christmas to all, and to all a good night!”",40.0,2015-12-24 18:32:20,0.82
"(Doge/Ethereum two-way peg, x-post from /r/dogecoin) I wrote up an implementation of scrypt in EVM for use in verifying dogecoin block headers","Here it is:

https://github.com/ethereum/dapp-bin/tree/master/scrypt

Note that it currently takes ~370M gas to verify one instance of scrypt, hence the function in my script above has the ability to save partial progress and start from the most recent saved state and go as far as it can; you need to send 118 transactions before the function actually returns an answer. The bulk of the annoyance is scrypt's choice to use salsa20, which needed to be implemented in serpent; if it weren't for that then the whole thing would likely be doable in one or two transactions.

Since this is obviously absurdly inefficient, you do need some cryptoeconomic machinery to make sure that the verification happens extremely rarely. My preferred scheme is a system where to submit a scrypt solution you must provide a security deposit with some minimum (say, 25 eth), and then there is a period of six hours where anyone can either challenge you (by submitting the 118 transactions to compute the scrypt result inside the blockchain) or outbid you (say, by at least 2x). If someone outbids you, then you or anyone else have six hours to outbid or challenge them. Once a challenge period runs out, or if the 118 transactions are submitted, the winner is determined based on either, if possible, the actual result of the 118 transactions or by who submitted the highest bid, and the winners and the transaction submitter proportionately collect 50% of the security deposits of the losers (the other 50% is burned). The theory is that the _threat_ of someone submitting the 118 transactions disincentivizes people from submitting a bad scrypt solution in the first place, and if the initial deposit is too low then the escalation mechanism allows other players to force it higher. Hence, in the normal case, people will just submit correct scrypt solutions with the minimal deposit and everyone will be happy.

The next step is actually integrating this into a version of btcrelay. I am not an expert on how litecoin/dogecoin merge mining works, so I'll need some help here on taking this code and turning it into an actual dogecoin block header verifier. For reference the original btcrelay can be found here: https://github.com/ethereum/btcrelay/

I welcome any questions, whether on the code, the cryptoeconomics, how it can actually be used, or anything else!",70.0,2015-12-18 11:20:48,0.96

Is Ether going to replace Litecoin as the global arbitrage instrument of choice? Interesting observation from ConsenSys,"From ConsenSys blog on BTC Relay:

>Currently Litecoin is being used to move “bitcoin” between exchange platforms faster than the Bitcoin system can currently move it on average. Traders buy LTC with BTC, transfer to another exchange, then convert LTC back to BTC. One application of the ETH-BTC swap mechanism enabled by BTC Relay is even faster movement of BTC between exchanges. This will of course require BTC and ETH to be traded on the same exchange and will also depend on the trustless exchange attracting sufficient users to create acceptable liquidity.

Would argue this isn't a discussion on price, but more of use-cases for Ether.",38.0,2015-12-14 17:42:42,0.86

Experimental iOS Geth framework,"Hey all,

  Even though it was possible until now to build Geth for mobile platforms (the android binaries have been available for a few months now), it was very painful to use, since they required custom wrapper code, packaging, etc, so it was very developer unfriendly to work with. Good for proof of concept and finding build issues, but not really helpful to build on top of.

  We started to focus a little on delivering a tad more developer friendly versions on Geth for various mobile platforms, that you could use ""out of the box"" in your mobile projects. To achieve this goal, we would like to release pre-built **experimental** libraries of Geth for all the major mobile platforms that you can link against and start hacking.

  Although most things will be common, there will probably be a few quirks that are platform specific, or features that can be used on one but not on another. More on this when the time comes.

  As the first release of this series, we created an Xcode framework for iOS that you can drag and drop onto your mobile project and have Geth up and running immediately. The provided API is **experimental to say the least**. It's a single method `run(""cli flags go here"")`, which as the name suggests starts up a Geth node as if done from the CLI, only within your mobile device/simulator. This API will obviously evolve when we get there, but it's enough to play with geth on iOS.

  There are probably a lot of issues as we ourselves haven't had the time yet to play with it. It's fresh out of the oven :) Please report any issues found to the [go-ethereum issue tracker](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/issues).

  Finally, the long awaited parts :P, the `Geth.framework` bundles are currently built by the nightly develop build bot, and every morning a report and new bundles posted on the [go-ethereum gitter channel](https://gitter.im/ethereum/go-ethereum). The first experimental build is [geth-1.4.0-unstable-787d71d-ios-7.0.tar.bz2](https://bintray.com/artifact/download/karalabe/ethereum/geth-1.4.0-unstable-787d71d-ios-7.0.tar.bz2). The framework includes the libraries for `ARMv7`, `ARM64` and `x86_64`.

  To go along with the framework bundle, I've uploaded two sample xcode projects using it. The [first](http://i.imgur.com/sgemwbA.png) is a simple UI that starts geth, connects to it via RPC and shows the sync progress. The [second](http://i.imgur.com/HCdBie8.png) is a snapshot of the Ethereum wallet from yesterday running in a webview and talking to an in-process geth node. The said examples should be considered highly unstable, demo code. You can get them from my [geth-sandbox GitHub repository](https://github.com/karalabe/geth-sandbox).

Happy hacking to all, and please remember that all of this is very experimental, so things will likely break in unexpected ways. We would however like to hear (on our issue tracker) about any issues you encounter as it's essential for a strong mobile support. Also please remember, that Geth has not been optimized for light mobile clients, so the performance will probably be abysmal (use `--fast` for one thing).

Cheers,
  Peter",24.0,2015-12-10 13:28:31,0.97

## Technologies and Apps
* **Do you have to use Meteor for building Dapps?** Not at all! You can use any frontend GUI you prefer (even plain javascript), just connect to your node. We just use it internally for our Dapps and our lead Dapp Developer Fabian has built a [lot of useful tools for that platform](http://atmospherejs.com/ethereum).
* **How do I include web3.js on my apps?** [Here's a primer]( https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/JavaScript-API#getting-started)

* **Is ethereum based on bitcoin?** No, we use bitcoins underlaying technology, [the blockchain](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Y3fWXA6d5k&amp;index=3&amp;list=PLJqWcTqh_zKHQUFX4IaVjWjfT2tbS4NVk), but Ethereum is a separate Blockchain. Ethereum has one of the first working implementations of [bitcoin side chains](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WGgoVmfIik&amp;index=17&amp;list=PLJqWcTqh_zKHQUFX4IaVjWjfT2tbS4NVk) so you can easily and quickly exchange ether and BTC.

* **What other cool apps are being built?** see this [awesome constantly updated list]( http://dapps.ethercasts.com/)
* **What's the future of Ethereum?** We are planning a switch to [Proof of Stake](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Y3fWXA6d5k&amp;index=3&amp;list=PLJqWcTqh_zKHQUFX4IaVjWjfT2tbS4NVk) in the near future. We are also investigating [scalability solutions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Y3fWXA6d5k&amp;index=3&amp;list=PLJqWcTqh_zKHQUFX4IaVjWjfT2tbS4NVk) and how to [store secrets on the blockchain](https://blog.ethereum.org/2014/12/26/secret-sharing-daos-crypto-2-0/)
* **No, I mean, how can I use ethereum to get information about the future?** [Augur](http://www.augur.net) and [Gnosis](http://groupgnosis.com) are building prediction markets that try to gather the best information about uncertain future events
* **No, but I want to discuss future price movements by scribbling graphs on trading charts!** Then you should [go here](/r/ethtrader) (not moderated by us).
* **How many ethers are there? How is that calculated?** There are about [77 million ethers](http://ethereum.stackexchange.com/questions/443/what-is-the-total-supply-of-ether) in existence and every new block (an average of 15 seconds) creates 5 new ether. This number can never be increased, but could be drastically reduced when we [switch to the more cost effective Casper consensus algorithm](https://blog.ethereum.org/2015/08/01/introducing-casper-friendly-ghost/). 
* **What is 'Gas'?** Every contract has a fixed computational cost that which is the result of which kind of call it executes. These costs are fixed by the protocol level, but to avoid having them fluctuate too much they are set in *gas* instead of *ether*. Every user selects the *gas price* they are willing to pay when they send a transaction or execute a contract and every node is free to accept that price or not, based on their minimum gas price, amount of transactions and other network conditions.


 ## Wallet Questions 


**How do I update my wallet?**

The wallet is an interface to the node. This means you can have multiple copies of the wallet, or overwrite your old copies without a problem 

**How do I backup?**

Open the wallet, go to accounts > backup and save those folders 

**Do I need to download the full Blockchain?**

Yes. Light clients are on the pipeline and before that there are some updates that will optimize and speed up the time it takes. 

**Is it safe to store my ether or import my presale wallet?**

Yes. Of course risk is relative and you should keep your computer protected from malware and wallet backed up. The wallet is still beta but at this point this is more related to crashes and other issues that might make it harder for a non geek to launch the wallet. But the chances of actually loss of ether are relatively small at that point and probably  smaller than an exchange getting hacked ",436.0,2015-12-08 15:45:48,1.0

Ethereum paper wallets for everyone! Workshop tomorrow 5pm EST/11pm CET on the Maker Teamspeak,"Hi everyone,

We noticed a lot of the MKR buyers don't yet have for high value, long term storage. To help with this we've decided to hold a paper wallet workshop on our teamspeak server where me and James from the Maker team will be able to help anyone at any level of technical expertise with setting up a secure paper wallet for long term storage, as well as give cryptocurrency relevant security advice for anyone interested. 

We're going to use a very simple and easy method of generating paper wallets - it doesn't require a printer, and probably won't take more than 5 minutes to set up. In fact you can do it right now by going to https://www.fourmilab.ch/javascrypt/pass_phrase.html , generate a random 16-word phrase, write it down on two pieces of paper, and then go to https://ryepdx.github.io/ethaddress.org/#/brainWallet , generate the public key and save it somewhere (you don't have to hide it as its a public key, but you need to make sure you don't lose it). The passphrase is your private key and is all you need to retrieve the tokens (be it ETH, MKR, REP, or anything else) you send to the public key in the future. Doing the above steps offline takes slightly more work as you have to download the websites first and run their javascript locally, but doing so increases security. We'll help you with every step over teamspeak.

Anyone, not just MKR buyers, are of course welcome to join the workshop! All you need is to download the teamspeak 3 client, and then connecting to ts.makerdao.com (no password). We will be online from 5pm EST/11pm CET tomorrow and until no one needs help.

If you are a MKR buyer we'll also instantly put your new Ethereum address in the MKR distribution list: https://forum.makerdao.com/t/mkr-public-distribution-list/351

We've also created the #security channel on the maker community slack (go to slack.makerdao.com to join instantly). Here we'll follow up on the paper wallets and discuss Ethereum wallets and private key security in general.",20.0,2015-12-02 17:53:25,1.0
Dear DApp developers ...,"... I've a favour to ask you all.

/u/frozeman has started a [document](https://gist.github.com/frozeman/fbc7465d0b0e6c1c4c23) on how to properly set up web3 with your DApp. This is in preparation to the upcoming mist releases which will inject Web3 automatically in to your DApp (though you are free to overwrite this).

At the moment when you're loading in a DApp in Mist it, for example, expects the RPC to be on port 8545 and assumes I have HTTP RPC running you'll get an error such as https://www.dropbox.com/s/tg3geh8k2nozv47/Screenshot%202015-12-01%2012.25.09.png?dl=0

-She goes to a random parking lot and  places it on the ground next to a specific location. she records GPS / [what3words](http://what3words.com/) address of the location
 
-She takes a picture of the location and the soda can. (in this case theoretical case, a 7Up sitting in the corner of stall 30C in some underground public garage)

-An ethereum contract is written which states:
               
	{ if 40 ethers hit this address; then  return location_image.jpeg  and  location ==  (GPS /“what3words”); }

-Bob is looking for some dank. He visits a decentralized online store-front where he finds Alice’s contract after he searches for the product in a general location by providing a postal code.

-After seeing Alice’s contract, Bob sends 40 ethers to the said contract and suddenly the image and the location of the product is revealed.

-Bob goes to the pick-up location.  

I call it, DropSpot. 

Yes, I understand there are some major problems with this arrangement, namely, what happens if the soda can is discharged or trashed before Bob arrives at the location? or what happens if Alice leaves an empty can? I think a reputation system can help discourage fraudulent sellers, and the unlikely scenario of someone cleaning/purging the can before Bob’s arrival, can just be seen as cost of doing business.

Go Ethereum nightly develop cross-builds,"Hey all!

For now it's only an experimental feature, but we've set up a cross compilation build bot that will compile the latest develop snapshot of Geth every night (around 5AM UTC) to all platforms supported by it. The primary goal behind this move is to provide binaries to more exotic, unsupported or experimental platforms outside of the official versions maintained by the team.

The packages will be uploaded to Bintray every night, and an announcement made on the [public go-ethereum Gitter channel](https://gitter.im/ethereum/go-ethereum), containing a link to each package, along with its size and SHA1 checksum.

Hope you'll find this feature useful. If you have any ideas, suggestions, concerns, etc, please ping me here (in the short term) or preferably on Gitter long term (@karalabe).

Cheers, and here's the first build report (coming every 5-6AM UTC from now on, on Gitter).

The BIS report: bankers show their teeth,"The 24 pages Bank for International Settlements' report on digital currencies is the incumbents' understanding of the developing cryptocurrency revolution. It recognizes cryptocurrencies as an threat as they “are an innovation that could have a range of impacts on various aspects of financial markets and the wider economy. These impacts could include potential disruption to 
business models and systems”. Being specific, the BIS reports points that “the decentralized nature of some digital currency schemes means that there is no identifiable scheme operator, a role that is typically played by financial institutions”. How to deal with this threat? Regulators to the rescue! They are missing from the action because “the recent development of digital currencies and the novelty of their design mean that they may not be specifically regulated and do not fit easily into existing regulatory definitions and structures”. Regulators should take notice of the potential ”use of these systems for illegal activity, as well as compliance with AML/CFT obligations that apply to traditional payment methods and intermediation” and they should consider as a type of regulatory action the “ban (or amount cap) on retail Bitcoin transactions”, “ban on digital currency acceptance by retailers”, “ban on digital currency-based financial instruments”, “ban on digital currency exchangers” and “ban on Bitcoin transactions between banks”. Banks are not taxis: they are global businesses and understand that “given the nature of digital currencies, which are typically online and therefore not limited to national jurisdictions, a coordinated approach at a global level may be important for regulation to be fully effective”.",29.0,2015-11-24 12:23:24,0.89

"Lets talk about decentralized governance of Ethereum, itself!","The Ethereum Foundation has been a focal point for the ethereum community: it paid for the development of the Ethereum platform and dapp/dev toolchain, and it took the lead on protocol decisions. As the community develops and becomes less reliant on the Foundation, we need a way to continue funding the development and maintenance of the project’s public goods.


Our collective ability to maintain the codebases, produce comprehensive and accessible documentation, do further protocol research, and deliver upgrades will impact the quality and quantity of dapps. We also need to be able to coordinate around hard forks, ideally making sure that approximately everyone has installed the new software before the upgrade ""kicks in"". 


We have long seen how difficult it has been for the Bitcoin community to fund core development and maintenance, even while Bitcoin companies have received large amounts of investment. The still-ongoing block size debate demonstrates how difficult it is for the Bitcoin community to hard fork the Bitcoin protocol. I hope that we can learn from the Bitcoin community and address these problems early.


These are hard problems, but the Ethereum project may be better equipped to solve them than any open source software project before it. We have a platform that can be used to create almost arbitrary, self-enforcing, low-trust financial contracts, governance tools, and coordination technology. We also have a community of some of the most brilliant, motivated and talented people around (that's you ;). 


We should work together with the aim of developing tools and norms that we can use to fund and govern the ongoing development of the Ethereum platform for many years into the future. Many of us are already working on tools that can be part of a solution that makes the sustainability of core development a reality! It would be really cool if we solved the governance and funding of public goods problems of Ethereum using Ethereum! I don't think we can solve it working in isolation on independent projects - so lets chat!!


I've started a slack team for us to do just that - if you can help solve this crazy thing (e.g. if you're developing a governance or funding tool) and you want to see the protocol itself eventually being governed by a DAO on Ethereum, I'd love to hear from you (and to send you an invite)!

A fair namespace without tokens or crowdsale,"

We need a fair namespace system for mist, swarm and apps but in my opinion it must have these characteristics: it should not favor or be controlled by any particular entity, any payments should be optimized to make spam and name squatting expensive, while trying to make other uses into efficient pricing. 

This proposal is based on what I've gathered from internal discussions with a lot of people inside the Ethereum team for the design I was pushing for Gavin's namereg. That hasn't yet happened and I want to share with everyone now:

## Renewal fees & the Monaco tax

I think thinking of renewal fees is more important than the first auction because even if you figure a fair way to distribute a name today then that's not necessarily fair in five years. Also since namespaces are a finite resource that means the continuous optimal usage of names is important. 

This comes from a history from Daniel Nagy that I've never been able to check its veracity but according to him the only tax paid in Monaco are property taxes, which are based on a fixed percentage of your property value. The property value is self declared with the catch that if you under declare it and someone tries to buy it from you, then you have to sell it. 

The second inspiration is a vickrey auction, a blind auction in which the top bidder wins but he only pays the second highest bid price. 

So here's how renewals would work:

1. Anyone who wants to buy a name can do a blind bid for it. The way a bid work is that a bidder submits a transaction an amount of ether thats higher than his bid, a hash of the name he is bidding and a hash of the bid. The hash of the bid is the hash of a text file containing the value he is bidding for, the amount of days he wants it for (min 180 and max 3600?) and a salt. The number of days has a two purposes: first it helps obscure the real bid amount, secondly it allows the asker to change the date when the renewal is done to a more convenient time for him as its crucial not to miss it. 
2. The owner of the current name must do the same, but he will get a multiplier X in his bid. So if X is 10 and they value their name at 1000 ether then they only need to bid 100 ether (multiplied by the time he wants it for)
3. When the name is about to expire there is a revelation period, ideally somewhere between 24h to a week. During those times all the bidders will make a transaction revealing their bid details. If bidders don't reveal their bid or if it doesn't match the hash then the money will be locked on the contract (or until the max period expires)
4. The highest bidder will be the new owner of the contract but will only pay the price of the second highest bidder. The remaining will be reimbursed to the buyer. All losing bids get full deposit back.
5. If no one else bid for that name then the buyer gets the renewal for free (except gas costs)
6. If the owner is outbidded then he will get the full amount of the second highest bid. This means if there was a single higher bidder then they'll get exactly what they valued their name for, if there are more bidders then they'll get more than they valued initially their own name. 
7. If the current owner is the highest bidder then they will have to pay the second highest amount divided by X. So in the case that X is 10 and the owner valued his name at 1000 ether, if the second highest bid was only for 800 ether then that means the owner will only have to pay 80 ether (multiplied per the time) in order to renew the name. 

All bids are done to the hash of the name, not the name itself. This is intended to create ""privacy by obscurity"": the more unknown your name is, the harder it is for people to bid it. This prevents people from simply watching the logs and waiting for a transaction in order to bid for it.  If your name is common or famous enough to be in a rainbow table then you are basically subject to public bidding. 

## Collectors contract 

All money collected by name owners who are renewing their name would go to an address called the Collector Contract. The collectors contract also has the right to change the multiplier X at any point. 

The collectors contract would be elected by the name holders. The nature of the election system is still open to discussion but it should have these characteristics:

* it should allow for multiple choices so as not to suffer from the Duverger Law
* It should be weighted by the amount that name owners paid in their last active period
* It should not make a distinction between an owner with many small addresses and a owner of a large address. 
* Election period should not be fixed. Ideally the longer a contract has been the collector, the smaller the consensus it should require to change it. So a collector that just has been elected would require an absolute majority to be deposed, but if it has stayed for a long time then any contract with more votes than its competitor should be able to be elected. 

No particular entity has any privilege to decide the collectors contract or use the collected funds. How often the X multiplier changes is up to the elected collected contract. 

This is particularly important as the namespace auctions are open to anyone, any particular entity that earns ether from it might be making a profit by taking a cut of potentially illegal or unethical DAOs. If ethics are particularly important for the namespace holders then they can vote in a collectors DAO that would subsidize ""ethical"" companies (defined however the elected contract wants it, of course) during bids. 

I would argue that the first collector contract should either be the zero address or a boomerang contract: a contract that keeps any money for X years and then returns it to the sender. This allow the ether saved in the first year to be saved to any elected contract in the future. 


## First auctions 

That defines how names are renewed, not how they are initially auctioned off. I'm focusing on this because if we focus on how getting renewals right, even if the initial distribution turns out to be unfair then at least that can change with time. 

Of course a similar vickrey auction could also be used to define the first initial distribution but other models could also work: 

*  create a initial namespace that starts by mimicking the most popular .com/.org domains (top 100? Top 1000000? how do we measure popularity?)
* Execute an all pay auction. These are very expensive for any competitive names discouraging anyone to try to bid in a name that they don't think they can win
* Reserve common words (in which languages? How to pick them? What about things like ""Apple""?)
* Do a reverse Dutch auction whose length is inversely proportional to the word length. I.e. The six letter word ""foobar"" would have an auction starting at a unrealistically high price which would go down slowly until it reaches 0 in n weeks, going to the first person to bid on it. N is bigger for shorter words. 


## Final thoughts and downsides 

The main issue is that it's too soon to decide on any system that will work potentially forever. But we are starting to need one system and it's important to set up one, even if temporary. Maybe it would be a good idea to experiment that system for a few years with the social consensus that we will update it in a few years down the line so don't hardcode the registry in any contracts. 
 
Maybe a great way to start would be NOT to register any name with less than six letters and only allow these in the future IF it becomes clear that the approach is the right one. 

The system is designed to optimize usage and find the better price for each name, so that no one is over paying yet it's not cheap enough that name squatting and spamming become profitable. Yet it also means that every name can be taken from anyone if there's a high enough bidder: this could be seen as censorship, but it's a process where the attacker is funding the ""victim"", for multiple times the amount they initially put in the name. At a multiplier of 100, anyone can keep their name by paying at most 1% of the value of their property per period, and if they lose it they'll be paid more than what they declared their property to be worth. 

Another issue is that being online during the reveal period is critical: any bidder who fails to reveal their bid will lose their bid and any owner who fails to reveal the self declared value will lie his name and only be paid the second highest revealed bid. 

There is a trusted solution: anyone should be able to reveal the bid if they know the details that make the hash, meaning that the owner could pass the information to one or more trusted peer if they feel they might not be able to connect during the reveal period. This could evolve into professional bidding companies that would hold private bids and reveal them. 

The consequences of not revealing bids might be catastrophic but the consequences of premature reveal (by breach of trust or leaked information) are less severe. Knowing a single bid does not guarantee that there aren't one or more higher bids, so it doesn't affect much the decision on who is the winner or the final price. But it has a bearing on the minimum amount paid: If the owner reveals a bid, someone might force him into paying the full renewal tax by bidding just below that which can be used for blackmail (send me money or ill force you to pay the full tax)

"Speaking about Augur & Ethereum at Oakland University on Nov. 17th (Metro-Detroit), Hoping to Start an Ethereum Meetup","For those who don't know, I'm the director of marketing for Augur and recently the American Marketing Association chapter of Oakland University asked me to speak, obviously I accepted and will be talking about Augur, Ethereum, Bitcoin and Marketing cutting edge technologies. The full event details can be found on the event page [here](https://orgsync.com/80128/events/1282308/occurrences/2871069).

I'm hoping that there will be enough interest to use this event to start a MeetUp in the area as I'm from Detroit but moved to Atlanta when I got into the cryptocurrency space for my career. My fascination with this tech started in 2012 and I had to leave the state for an opportunity to work in the field, I'm doing everything I can to make sure people interested now don't have to face this problem!

If there are any Metro-Detroiters here, I would encourage you to either come out to the event or simply hit me up ([@TonySwish](http://twitter.com/tonyswish) and I'll gladly give you a Skype handle) as I still love my hometown and really do hope to do something cool when I'm there.

Additionally, Vitalik asked me to speak at DevCon but it wasn't cost-effective for Augur so I declined to attend (although honored he asked), so the talk I'm giving at OU will be very similar to what I planned to present at DevCon. The only differences will be on explaining the technology at a beginner level as the main content will be marketing cutting-edge tech and some of the successes/failures I've experienced with Augur and BitPay. 

I'm hoping to film this so future Ethereum projects can learn from said successes/failures, although right now the person filming seemed to back out so that is tentative.",22.0,2015-11-10 05:43:43,1.0

What is the meaning of buying ether?,"Trying to understand what does it mean to own ether. 

- am I buying the equivalent of a stock in a company? 

- am I buying part of the ethereum network (ownership of this limited network)? 

I know that some speak of bitcoin as a reserve currency, a holder of value. Is it the same here? 

If no one decided to actually hold ether, and ethereum is - let's say - the most used network in the world, doesn't this mean that ether is worthless? 

I do understand that it is perhaps difficult to explain the holding of ether to non-coders (or is it?), but perhaps a solid analogy will suffice.

Solidity and the Solidity compiler,"Hi. I have just done a fairly big application and would like to post some findings.


About me: I have been writing big smart contract systems and applications for quite some time. Before Solidity I did lots of LLL code, including this (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVupNB_uFwk&list=PL6B3Sm2L7jf2aRr859K8GFncNUw6uFMxv). I also did some Serpent, but python is not my language (although it is nice). I started messing around with Solidity contracts about 1 year ago, when there still was no compiler and you had to extend the code and combine the lexer & parser etc. to use it.


The project I'm talking about now is under an NDA, so I can not be specific about the actual content, but it is basically an instrument for instantiating and managing the life-cycle of a certain type of security. It consists of 30 or so smart-contracts, totaling about 3,5k lines of code. This means I faced most of the issues a non-trivial system would. I have also spent time with others working on similar things, and some of the things I put here have been brought up by others too, and as you will see - most of them just make sense. That being said, these are of course next level features. Things that would be nice if they were added at some point (when the basic stuff is in place).

**Findings**

First of all - Solidity works great. Some ""basic"" language features are still missing, but the stuff that's in there works. Even when put to the test. It could be that I avoid pitfalls ""subconciously"", having worked with it a lot, but either way it is fairly painless to write code. Imo it probably doesn't take a lot longer to write something in Solidity then in any other language.


There are some things that makes it difficult to work with, though. These are being addressed, and it's way to early for some of this, but I still want to write what exactly caused problems for me. Basically - this is what I'd like to see at some point.


1 - Floating/fixed-point numbers... Blockchains = finance, pretty much,  and you need those in finance. Yes you can use scaling and such but personally I'd like to see this built into the language asap. Actually, it should not only implement the real/ureal types but also have a contract with methods for doing rounding etc. as part of the standard library.

2 - Pattern matching. It is impossible to do proper input validation (EDIT: on-chain). I'd go as far as to say that without built-in support for this, smart contracts simply aren't safe. A full-on implementation of some regexp like system in Solidity does not really make sense (though it would be an interesting exercise), so it should probably be solved in some other way.

3 - No access to a calendar. This also makes it hard to do any real world stuff.

4 - Solc is not good at compiling code that is divided up into different files in different folders. It does allow you to specify output folder now, but there are still issues. Relative paths should be better supported in import statements, among other things. If you want to set up a proper workspace atm., you pretty much have to write the build/make system yourself, including copying into temp folders, dependency management, etc. It would be great with an extended tool suite that includes makefiles and such.

5 - A unit testing framework! Crappy javascript libraries (EDIT: i.e. my own) calling functions and checking values may be enough for scam-coins and such, but not for real systems. With the recently added tuples it is now possible to call most Solidity functions from other Solidity contracts. There are workarounds for dynamically sized arrays and mappings and stuff, but it's still a problem of course but imo the only thing needed to make a good framework now is templates and a proper generic type (for assertions mostly).

6 - Better debuggers (EDIT: not an issue for me personally as I normally don't use one, but last time I tested a debugger it was still showing assembly and that's hard to read now that solidity adds so many extra instructions).


NOTE: I don't follow the progress daily, and some of this may already be available in some way, but this is what I felt was missing. Interested in pushing this forward.",34.0,2015-11-01 00:28:19,0.91

Write or DIE anti-procrastination smart contract,"Hi,

I would like to hire someone to write this as a smart contract.  EDIT: per below I would pay 4,500 US into a bitrated escrow to fund project.

Goal of smart contract is to create deadlines for things that do not have deadlines.  This will help people better manage procrastination and get more things done.  Process of deadline creation achieved through smart contract penalties.  Process of affirmation that deadline was reached verified through social network.

**Step 1** fund smart contract with 500 ETH of writers money

**Step 2** Set a every other day writing requirement of 500 words (seems easy enough).

**Step 3** Set a countdown timer that begins at midnight

**Step 4** Create a way to submit 500 words to an interface that will stop countdown timer.

**Step 5** If at 30 minutes to midnight no writing is submitted then reminder email is sent.  If at Midnight no writing is submitted then countdown beings

**Step 6** Begin counter.  For every 1 minute past deadline set aside 1 ETH.  If writing submitted stop clock then total penalties use shapeshift.io to convert to bitcoin and send one lump sum to enemy address.  If not drain contract until 60 ETH is spent (max penalty for 60 minutes or more past deadline).

**Step 7** Enemy address is say Benjamin Lawsky's BTC address or maybe it sends money to the Mark Karpele's defense fund.  Contract publishes on Reddit saying “Josh missed his deadline and Write or Die bought Mark Karpele’s 50 donuts” or “Josh missed his deadline and Write or Die gave 0.1234 BTC to fund bit license because we need more bitcoin regulation”.

**Step 8** Once written content is submitted smart contract uses author’s friends to determine if content submitted was acceptable.  Contract forwards written content for review to select friends.  If content is 51% thumbs up then no penalty.  If 51% thumbs down then penalty money goes to a positive charity.

**Conclusion**  If above 51% writer preserves his own funds until final deadline is met and contract returns entire amount to writer.  Late submissions result in giving to the most hated man in bitcoin.  Bad content results in giving to a charity.  The only way writer gets to keep his money is if he writes good content consistently.

Other uses might be:

- Write or DIE

- Run or DIE

- Weightloss or DIE

An analysis of an Ethereum contract.,"I was looking at [a list of Ethereum contracts](https://etherchain.org/contracts) for something to read.  I picked [this one](https://etherchain.org/account/0x10ebb6b1607de9c08c61c6f6044b8edc93b8e9c9) because it has [a relatively short code](https://etherchain.org/account/0x10ebb6b1607de9c08c61c6f6044b8edc93b8e9c9#codeDisasm).  Skimming through, I realized that the only instruction that can transfer value is the `SUICIDE` at the end.  When can this happen?  To see this, I wrote [a small ad-hoc symbolic interpreter](https://gist.github.com/pirapira/0946d151e038393078c3) for a small part of the EVM language.

The `SUICIDE` operation sends the remaining fund to the address at `storage[0]`.  For this to happen, the caller's address must be the one at `storage[0]` and the current time must be bigger than `storage[1]`.  Currently the contract has a non-zero value at `storage[1]`.
The current time changes as we go, but when does `storage[1]` change?  Well, never again.  There is an API to change the value at `storage[1]` but this can be used only when it contains zero.

So this contract seems like a locker that cannot be opened before a certain timestamp value.

The symbolic executor is quite limited.  It just covers the instructions used in this particular contract.  The gas calculation is ignored.  Currently the execution is slow and requires manual intervention.  This should be done automatically at least for a contract without loops.  And we should obtain a list covering all possible side-effects, each annotated with a pre-condition.

How do we make Ethereum *useful* Can it really be done?,"So after that provoking headline, I first want to thank the Ethereum team and developers in all side projects, it's a great effort in a short amount of time. However...

I think back of the critisism that the Truthcoin founder raised and it's still valid in my eyes. Without outside input (feeds) to Ethereum most that can be developed are gambling dApps, which are interesting but not really world changing.

How can we connect Ethereum to the outside world? We need feeds! With feeds I mean data from the outside world beeing available to Ethereum contracts. Like the price of BTC, the Weather in NYC or the population of Norway. How can the feeds be trusted, it either has to be centralized with a trusted supplier or de-centralized with some sort of oracle system. Problem is what is the incentive to provide the feeds.

Where Peter (Truthcoin) is correct I believe is that feeds will not be able to be monetized, so they have to be done for the good of the community.

Then there is my question: **how do we support the creation of feeds?** Why would anyone create them and if created how do we trust them? I think this is crutial for Etherum.

PS: The Alarm clock project https://github.com/pipermerriam/ethereum-alarm-clock is a great example of something I would like to support!",25.0,2015-10-17 07:57:34,0.86

Let's talk about the coin standard,"We currently have a [proposal for a coin contract standard](https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/Standardized_Contract_APIs#subcurrencies)

Having a standard is very important as it allows every coin to be compatible with every wallet and every exchange built to the same standards. Everyone has their own ideas on how they want to handle their own tokens but by adhering to the standard we can agree that all coins will have the same basic functionality of ""simple send"" and ""get balance"".

Currently the standard has the following main functions:

* sendCoin: simply send X amount of coins to an address
* coinBalanceOf: how many coins does Bob has?

It also has these optional other functions that may or may not apply to your particular coin: sendCoinFrom, approve, unapproved, isApprovedFor, approveOnce, isApprovedOnceFor and some events.

I started working on integrating coins into the official wallet and found the need to expand the standard, to include optional variable names that would tell the client the name, symbol and base unit of the coin, but when I started asking around people I realised that almost everyone else who was working on ethereum based currencies had some reservations on it, so I wanted to discuss it on the open before we can update the standard.

Some issues I've seen:

* the name ""Coin"" is too specific as the standard will work for any tradeable, fungible token. Its not meant to anything that can be tradeable, unique items that can have a single owner (like domains or usernames) should not be contemplated by the standard. Some have proposed changing the names to a more generic sounding actions like transfer (instead of sendCoin) and getBalance (instead of coinBalanceOf)

* Some have raised issues on how to update the standard to allow forwards and backwards compatibility. Completely incompatible standards in the future can be solved by creating an ""interface contract"" that will basically forward one function name to the other, but we should think of elegant versioning solutions to avoid that. I would suggest adding a variable on the contract that states which standard it tries to be compatible with.

* Other issues are often related to each specific implementation of coins or securities. I would like to remember that the purpose of the standard is having the minimum functionalities we can all agree so that tokens can be stored and transferred in a wallet. Any other functionality can be solved by creating further functions and implementing a Ðapp to manage them.

So, what does the community think? Have you tried implementing coins? What do you need from the standard?

**Update** 

So this is the new proposed standard for ""Transferable Fungibles"":

Methods

**sendCoin** renamed to **transfer**

**sendCoinFrom** renamed to **transferFrom**

**coinBalanceOf** renamed to **balanceOf**

**CoinTransfer** (event) renamed to **Transfer**

Unchanged: approve, unapproved, isApprovedFor, approveOnce, isApprovedOnceFor

New events: AddressApproval, AddressApprovalOnce

Variables: we are still debating the comparative advantages of having each contract have its own variables or to have a central contract that keeps that information up to date (based on algorithms, no manager).

I still propose having a standard variable that sets the token standard it adheres to, or a set of standards it adheres to.

Now with remote Ethereum Node, browser based wallet, BTC Deposit and new markets!","We want to thank everyone who has been testing and providing feedback on the Alpha version of Gnosis. We want to make the best possible product and you are helping us get there! Now the updates:

**1. Remote Ethereum Node:** you no longer need to be running a local ethereum client to use Gnosis. This means that Gnosis is now accessible from anywhere regardless of your local machine.

**2. LightWallet browser integration:** The LightWallet allows you to have control over your private keys without having to run a local Ethereum node. The private keys are created from the seed and encrypted in the browser. You can then sign transactions in the browser and send the signed transaction to a remote (or local!) node. Gnosis does not hold any of the funds in your wallet.

**3. Bitcoin deposit:** No we have not yet solved cross chain exchanges but we have enabled Shapeshift.io for making deposits in ETH even easier.

**4. New Markets:** Who will win the MLB National League Division Series?... Who will be the next GOP candidate to drop out of the US presidential race? … Will the Patriots go 4-0 in week 4? .. Check GroupGnosis.com for all current markets !

Please let us know what you think!

Introducing the world's first fully decentralized raffle for 1000 ETH.,"OneEther is making history tonight. We've seen the painful failures in the past when it comes to centralized markets. BitLotto anyone?

**[One.Thousand](http://oneether.com/thousand) changes it all now.** See [the full release notes here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1VTWKo5V2ihBgZPLS43WYl2cWADd9Rysko2CT0OabdAg/edit) as to why it all works and why it was made.

**How it works**

Tickets are bought through a contract that's provably fair and publicly auditable. Every thousand tickets, one is drawn at random and the winner receives 1000 ETH.

**Why we're better**

It lives on the freaking blockchain. The code is public. It's completely decentralized and that means complete transparency, immunity to DDOS, immunity to exit scams, and much more. It doesn't get better than this!

**Pricing**

1-4 Tickets: 1.150 ETH 

5-9 Tickets: 1.100 ETH 

10-24 Tickets: 1.050 ETH 

25+ Tickets: 1.025 ETH

**How do we decide who wins?**

The winner is decided using three key elements:

1. A *server secret* of which the hash is revealed beforehand. We have 24 hours upon the termination of a round to reveal the server secret; otherwise everyone gets their money back.
2. A *client secret* which is updated each time a transaction is sent *within a round*. Once the round ends, this is set in stone.
3. The blockhash of the block following the round. This is also set in stone upon the end of a round.

We can't cheat you because we can't easily modify (2 and 3). You can't cheat us because you don't know (1). It's to our advantage to pay you to keep the contract running.

**But we need you.** All of you. The price of Ethereum's been going through some tough times lately, and we need to show the world exactly what Ethereum can do that other cryptos can't. So let's show the world how to run a truly decentralized raffle with the best crypto around! Let's try to finish a round and make history.

IPFSMail,"So imagine you wanted a universal addressing and messaging system, much like e-mail, but you wanted the benefit of not only encrypting your mail but also making it impossible to see who mailed who what.

1st you would need a name registrar. This is so that you can register Alice@secrets.sup and Bob@nuayabiz.yo as e-mail addresses. Ofcourse any type of identity would do. They would associate that to a public key. We already have this functionality on Namecoin and it's relatively simple to implement on Ethereum.

2nd you encrypt the message for the recipient and post the encrypted message to IPFS. This will produce a hash for you. Which you then also encrypt with the their public key and then...

3rd you need a notification system, to make it universal, let's say that we chose an ethereum smart contract that does nothing but accept the encrypted IPFS hashes. It does nothing with them except displays them, so that mail clients can scan the contract for hashes that it can decrypt with it's private key. Once decrypted, the IPFS hash is available and the mail can be retrieved. 

What makes this cool is;
No one knows that an IPFS hash is in fact a mail.
No one knows who a mail is for except the sender.
No one knows that the recipient even received an e-mail.
All that might be known is that a Ethereum public key communicated to a contract known to host e-mails. IE, maybe, big maybe, we know of someone who sent mail.
Posting storage to a smart contract would incur a minor cost, so spam should be radically mitigated. 

Contract could have the following footprint:

    contract IPFSMail
    {
        void List(hash);

        eth Delist(hash); //only successful when called by the sender, returns the cost of storage back to the sender
    }

PS I'm fairly sure I'm not the first to have had this idea.

Chinese Auto Giant Wanxiang Plans $50 Million Blockchain Fund,"First of all, a BIG thank you to everyone who headed over to Coindesk.com last night to slay the trolls. Your comments on the news article about the blog post from  u/vbuterin were excellent. As of this hour more than 86 comments and clarifications from Etherians lit up the Crypto news site. 

Tonight we have more clarification from Coindesk - a somewhat brief but more defined article tipped off from Vitalik's writing about a $50M VC fund by Wanxiang Holdings for projects built on Ethereum (actually, it's all for Crypto 2.0, not just Ethereum...). Congratulations to Vitalik, the Foundation, ETHDEV, and the blossoming Ethereum community for this development.

I am hoping to learn more, like many of you. Many questions remain. And so I am wondering, today, are you a for-profit Ethereum start-up, or prospective Ethereum entrepreneur with a business idea or project who already has a clearly established business model, plan, and/or working code?

If so, can you help educate Coindesk readers again in the comments section of today's news article, so that readers unfamiliar with the Ethereum's dApps concept can get a good idea of Ethereum's capabilities? People need concrete examples and less jargon and conceptual discussion - to come over to the ""it is better to build on Ethereum than Bitcoin"" presupposition. This should also give readers a better idea about what kinds of things might come from $50m investment. You know, to get their juices and imagination flowing.",22.0,2015-09-29 23:51:18,0.84

Periodic dev updates,"While the github repositories are the best way to see real progress ([example](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pulse)), I think it would be valuable to the community for devs to post a weekly or bi-weekly update similar to the MaidSafe [dev updates](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ZZyUzXPyXhuM5x8BYCjANv-6L_YWwdgXNYXmz71Awmk/edit). Just a brief summary of a few major items from each dev. 

The upside is a better understanding in the community of development progress, especially for those who don't peruse github. The downside is potentially more criticism of what's being worked on to deal with, which could take time away from development. 

I'd like to hear what the community, devs, and foundation members think of this idea going forward.

Talkether.org: Ethereum's first pool with decentralized mining process search for alpha testers,"*Talkether.org is Ethereum's first pool with a decentralized mining process. It helps securing the Ethereum network by decentralizing it again. Miners of talkether.org will most likely have higher mining rewards compared to other pools due to higher mining efficiency. For the closed alpha release we search for testers.*

For further information about the project please visit: www.talkether.org

We had a short delay in the start of the alpha release since we had to wait for a feature in geth and cpp-ethereum to be added. That said I want to thank Gav and Jeff for adding the requested features really fast! :) 
Now we are up and running the alpha test, but still search for some alpha testers.

If you would like to join, send me a message via:

* skype: talkether

* email: support@talkether.org

It would be perfect if the message would include the following information:

* What's your OS?

* Which client (geth or cpp-ethereum) do you use?

* What's your hashrate per rig?

* How many rigs do you have?


Once I have the information I can send you a small tutorial how to join the talkether.org pool.

Cheers! Philipp (PhiStr90)

talkether.org - lets mine together

EDIT: Everyone who uses windows and is interested in alpha testing:
We have currently an issue regarding registration on windows. This will be resolved most likely tomorrow. I'll put you on the list of testers but will send you the tutorial once the problem is resolved.",22.0,2015-09-22 13:49:21,0.88

Prepare yourselves for the assault on Ethereum by certain hostile elements within bitcoin community.,"The first attack of the day: https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/3lu9my/mining_woes_ethereum_is_already_suffering_similar/

* The premise of this attack is to discredit the Ethereum Frontier release based on 5 years of bitcoin evolution, even though the Ethereum main net is only a few weeks old. 
* Let's say big / centralized bitcoin mining pools happened roughly 4-5 years after bitcoin started... how decentralized will Ethereum be in 4-5 years of Ethereum? No one knows. 
* This is so silly. It is purely a bitcoin moshe pit echo chamber fanboy post. Done.

The second attack of the day: 
https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/3luapr/why_oracles_not_ethereum_are_the_real_smart/

* The argument is that Ethereum is basically useless. 
* Paul is a smart guy, but let's face it, this is an emotional attack. He is super annoyed that Augur utilized pieces of his (formerly abandoned but now just recently resurrected?) project and built it on Ethereum with Reputation.
* Recent funding by Roger Ver seems to indicate a possible motive? 
* Here is Paul's epicly long anti-Augur argument: https://github.com/truthcoin/www.truthcoin.info/blob/gh-pages/faq/index.md
* Mr. Sztorc: It would be very wise of you to perfect your technology  and leave Ethereum / Augur alone. You're only creating bad friction. Competition is great, but this is just ridiculous.

Ethereum Comms Announcement,"I had promised to make an announcement regarding news and changes to the Foundation some time around now; this is still in the works, however I realized that it would be more appropriate to separate out the announcements and release things as they become ready and focus on actual actions and not simply write a pretty but commitment-free 2000-word essay to make people feel better.

The foundation is currently in the phase of restructuring its communications activities. Several members of our current communications team in London are soon leaving or reducing their involvement in the Foundation in order to pursue for-profit ventures on top of the Ethereum ecosystem; we wish them the best of luck. And so, we have both the necessity and a unique opportunity to ""reboot"" that side of the organization and take another look at how the Ethereum foundation interacts with the community.

As some initial steps, we are going to do the following:

* We will make an effort to de-emphasize Skype, and emphasize Gitter as a means of real-time communication for developers. Gitter has the advantages that (i) it's easier to quickly jump in and participate, and (ii) chat rooms are public and visible to everyone by default. Currently, the primary active Gitter rooms are:
  * https://gitter.im/ethereum/cpp-ethereum
  * https://gitter.im/ethereum/pyethereum
  * https://gitter.im/ethereum/go-ethereum
  * https://gitter.im/ethereum/mist
  * https://gitter.im/ethereum/web3.js
* We will continue our general direction of increasing permissiveness that we began with our [recent changes to branding guidelines](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/3jz7kb/new_ethereum_branding_guidelines/), and emphasis on maintaining norms of common sense and civility over strict rules. We are not following in the footsteps of /r/bitcoin's theymos. Discussion of EthereumXT (I suppose the closest equivalent we have is [Expanse](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1173722.0), with its 10x higher gas limit) is NOT banned.
* We will de-emphasize the ""ETH DEV"" brand (with the exception of ""DEVcon"") and focus attention on ""Ethereum"" going forward

In the medium term, we are in the process of substantially re-examining our strategy internally including meetups, general community outreach, trademark policy, developer documentation, and communicating information on protocol updates (e.g the most pressing short-term updates will be at the networking level to faciliate support of light clients, and larger future changes will be for proof of stake, scalability, etc), as well as interacting with the rapidly growing number of both individual and organizational/corporate Ethereum developers outside of the foundation proper. We will continue releasing more concrete info on both this and other topics as it becomes ready, and welcome community input on any of these issues.",82.0,2015-09-18 17:51:09,0.96

Basic Questions About the Ethereum EVM and State Storage,"This is cross-posted in the forum, but it seems like there's more readership here.  https://forum.ethereum.org/discussion/3420/basic-questions-about-how-ethereum-works

I have a few questions about how the system/EVM works. These are probably basic questions, but after reading the information around I can't seem to wrap my head around exactly what's going on. If there's a reference for where I can read the answers, please let me know!

1) Where is each contracts' assembly/bytecode physically stored? Looking at the blocksizes, it looks like they're currently about 780 bytes, so I assume that's not storing the contracts code directly. 

2) Where is the EVM memory physically stored? Is every node running the EVM and holding the entire memory?

3) When a node sends a transaction to the network and has the receiver as a contract, does every node execute the contract bytecode with the inputs to confirm the hash? Or does the first node receiving the transaction execute and create the transaction hash that's then distributed and is what's used for consensus. Basically, is the contract code executed once or many times for each transaction? I assume the it's the former if every node is running the EVM. 

4) Where is the data for the state transition function actually stored? 

Fundamentally, I'd like to understand where the pieces of the EVM, EVM memory, state transition function, and contracts are stored and actually executed. What storage medium is housing them, and what processor is executing the instructions? 

Any help from knowledgeable folks would be most appreciated.",20.0,2015-09-08 18:21:11,0.93

"Difficulty adjustment scheme, block 200,000 coming soon.","On August 4th Stephen Tual wrote about the network's difficulty adjustment scheme, which will slow the network down into a freeze over the course of a year and a half or so to prepare the network for the switch to a proof of stake blockchain. Here's the link and relevant text from the blog: https://blog.ethereum.org/2015/08/04/ethereum-protocol-update-1/

>A lot of you have been wondering how we would implement a switch from PoW to PoS in time for Serenity. This will be handled by the newly introduced difficulty adjustment scheme, which elegantly guarantees a hard-fork point in the next 16 months.

>It works as follow: starting from block 200,000 (very roughly 17 days from now), the difficulty will undergo an exponential increase which will only become noticeable in about a year. At that point (just around the release of the Serenity milestone), we’ll see a significant increase in difficulty which will start pushing the block resolution time upwards.

>So, a year on, the network will continue to be useful for roughly 3-4 months, but eventually will reach an ‘Ice Age’ of sorts: the difficulty will simply be too high for anyone to find a block. This will allow us to introduce PoS, perhaps via Casper, if it proves itself.

I haven't seen much mention of this since then.  It sounds like there won't be any big change for a while, but since the 200,000th block is coming up today here's a reminder of an aspect of the network's rules.  

Has anyone figured out how much the adjustment scheme will increase blocktimes over time?",24.0,2015-09-07 11:34:18,0.94
www.ethereumwallet.org - A safe web wallet with full source code disclosed,"**We are today announcing [https://www.ethereumwallet.org](https://www.ethereumwallet.org)**

**INTRODUCTION**

My name is Alan. Me and a small group of students are what you would call ""*crypto-nerds*"".
We are following the entire crypto scene for a very long time, and Ethereum has raised our attention a while ago.

We found that the ethereum clients (that you find out in the wild) are too geeky for the average user. So
in order to improve the mass adoption of ETH, we want to give our contribution to the community and introduce [Ethereumwallet](https://ethereumwallet.org).

**SOURCE CODE**

The full source code has been released on Github [https://github.com/Ethereumwallet/online-wallet-hd](https://github.com/Ethereumwallet/online-wallet-hd) so that the community can frequently check the code in terms of security. Also, the Github includes instructions on how to run the web wallet locally (for the paranoids).

**SAFETY**

Your password is never sent to the server. What the server does save, it your AES encrypted wallet.
When you visit the website it would then download the encrypted wallet, and decode it locally using your password.
The decoded data at no point leaves your computer.
For an additional security measure you may export your 12 word mnemonic seed, so even if you lose your password you can recover your funds.
Also here, the mnemonic is never transmitted to the server.
This web client works just like any other offline ethereum client.

**ADOPTION**

We can proudly report, that we have just relayed the 1000th transaction made with the web wallet.

**SCREENSHOTS**

Snitch Smart Contract,"We hear a lot about about how smart contracts could perpetuate crime (recent MIT article).  But what about Ethereum's power to help prevent/solve crime?  In many low income neighborhoods a prevailing motto and mind-set is, ""Snitches get stitches.""  So often these inhabitants don't want to risk a meeting with the police.  What is the point?  They will gain nothing and could get ""stitches.""  But picture this:  A city police department creates their own smart contract to help solve a murder.  They offer a bounty of $500 for the name of the person who has committed the murder.  Anyone can submit a name.  The police can read the names submitted.  Probably if the same name is submitted more than once they will pay closer attention to it.  If the accused is arrested or convicted the contract pays out, splitting the money to everyone who submitted the correct name.  For snitches there would be a 0% chance to be caught by prying eyes in the neighborhood, and they could make some easy money without coming in contact with a centralized entity (the police department).   Once crooks realized that these bounties were popping up all over the place, it might act as a deterrent, and actually prevent some crime from occurring.  So what do you think?  Should police departments start using Ethereum?   ",23.0,2015-09-04 18:50:53,0.91
"We made an ether version of RushWallet: EthereumWallet.com (VERY beta, use at your own risk)","Check out the beta and tell us what you think:  [ethereumwallet.com/beta/index.html](http://ethereumwallet.com/beta/index.html)

**Background:**

I'm the CTO of [KryptoKit](http://kryptokit.com/), the software company that makes [RushWallet](http://kryptokit.com/rush/) and the [KryptoKit chrome extension](http://kryptokit.com/bitcoin-wallet-extension/).  We're big fans of Ethereum and we've thrown together an instant ether wallet (similar to RushWallet) that allows you to easily send and receive ether from your browser or smartphone.  This is very early software, so it is definitely ""use at your own risk.""  We recommend using the wallet with small amounts only--this is still Frontier after all!

Here are the details of how the wallet works:

* When you first use the wallet, you generate a random private key by moving your mouse around the page.  At this time we do not support importing or exporting json wallets--you must create a wallet on the website in order to send or receive funds via the website.
* Optionally, you may add a password during wallet creation
* The page will create a unique and secret URL that you *must* bookmark in order to be able to access your wallet later.  **If you lose your URL or forget your password, there is no way to recover your funds.**
* The secret part of the bookmark (after the '#') is never sent to our server and exists only locally on your machine.  The password is not stored anywhere--when you type it in it is combined with the secret part of the URL to create a private key.  *We do not send this private key to the server at any time.*
* If you want to see what the code is doing (we encourage this!), you can view the unminified javascript directly in your browser.  The most important thing for you to be certain of is that your key is truly random, and **never** leaves your computer.  For those who are interested, we are using the [ethereumjs-tx](https://github.com/ethereum/ethereumjs-tx) and [ethereumjs-accounts](https://github.com/SilentCicero/ethereumjs-accounts) libraries to construct and sign transactions, and the API from etherscan.io to retrieve history/balances as well as send transactions.

Development work is ongoing, and we hope to add QR code scanning for Android devices soon.


Once again, be aware that this is VERY beta software.  We try to be careful, but we cannot be responsible for any losses due to software bugs, cryptographic weaknesses, or other errors.  Bookmark formats may also change going forward.  Use this software at your own risk.",38.0,2015-09-04 11:53:40,0.86

Go/Geth vs CPP/ETH - Compatibility Problems Need Fixing Before Transition Will Be Widespread,"Ethchain put up a great graphic on the distrbution of the node platforms. https://etherchain.org/statistics/basic  As you can see, Go/Geth dominates.  There's been a lot of talk of wanting to improve the distribution and have people switch to CPP/ETH to improve network stability and security. That's a great goal, but it won't happen until CPP/ETH's issues are resolved.  

The primary problem is that everyone started on Go/Geth, everyone's JSON key files are generated by Go/Geth, and those key files cause CPP/ETH to segfault when you try to load/import them or use them.  Geth on the other hand is as easy as dropping the key file in your keystore, and it's done.  Until the compatibility between Go/Geth and CPP/ETH is fixed, no one will switch because their keys were generated by Geth. 

One of the benefits of CPP/ETH is Alethzero, but that too crashes if you try to use a Geth generated JSON key file.  Another major usability issue is that it's really tough to figure out your public account address in CPP/ETH.  Using Alethzero there's no option to get it, and the double-click-copy method I've seen espoused doesn't seem to work. So, of course, one would go look in the JSON key file, since it's there in Geth generated JSON key files. But unlike Geth JSON key files, the account address isn't in an CPP/ETH JSON key file.  So you can't easily import your existing Geth keys and you can't easily figure out what the account address is for CPP/ETH generated keys. FWIW the whole experience trying to use CPP/ETH is just painful and I think even those that try to switch to improve network security often simply just give up and go back to the tried-and-true, easy to use Go/Geth.  If the usability and compatibility issues were resolved, I think you'd see more people switching. 

My. 02. I hope this gets fixed, because it is a problem for the network.

[Code] Avg. Block Time vs. Difficulty Adjustment Issue? 23s / 8T and Rising...,"According to https://etherchain.org/statistics/basic since Aug. 25th the average block time has been rising about 1s per day.  From Jul 31 to Aug 25 the network settled around 17s.  But, since Aug. 25th difficulty has increased essentially linearly from 5.8T to over 8T without a corresponding change in hashrate, which has caused a similar linear increase of the block time from 17s to 23s. Why?

The difficulty code for Go and CPP ethereum are below for reference. I am curious why there is an imbalance between the upward and downward adjustments.  One would assume, if you pick a target block time, and start at the correct difficulty, difficulty would simply oscillate above and below the baseline equally with the random walk of block times. But to stay balanced, it seems like one would need to, on average, return  to the baseline.  One fast block, one slow block, back to back should return you to where you started, no? That's not what happens here. 

The ethereum difficulty adjustment is a function of the current block's difficulty: downward adjustment = _parent.m_difficulty - (_parent.m_difficulty / c_difficultyBoundDivisor) and upward adjustment: (_parent.m_difficulty + (_parent.m_difficulty / c_difficultyBoundDivisor)

This means when you're at a high difficulty moving lower, you will subtract relatively more than when you're low going higher. Maybe that's right, but it seems odd to me to have such an imbalance. 

Take a look at these blocks:

    176001
    Difficulty: 8,024,368,437,904
    Time: 2015-09-02T12:37:38+02:00 (2 hours ago)

    176002
    Difficulty: 8,028,286,586,555
    Time: 2015-09-02T12:37:39+02:00 (2 hours ago)

    1s and Change = 3,918,148,651

    176003
    Difficulty: 8,024,366,524,746
    Time: 2015-09-02T12:39:30+02:00 (2 hours ago)

    60s and Change = -3,920,061,809

    176004
    Difficulty: 8,028,284,672,463
    Time: 2015-09-02T12:39:31+02:00 (2 hours ago)

    1s and Change = 3,918,147,717


fast - slow -fast leaves you with a lower difficulty than where you started both because you subtracted more, and because you were slightly relatively lower when you added again.  Could this over correction downward somehow paradoxically cause an overall increase in difficulty? I don't know. Imbalances always seem to cause unexpected issues IME.  

Maybe someone smarter than me can chime in and explain that this algorithm is correct, or maybe someone can help explain why the block time seems to be increasing with difficulty not correcting it.

What do you think of my first contract: DeadMansSwitch (dms),"This contract DeadMansSwitch (dms) allows you to set an address for your next of kin as well as a time interval (seconds). If you are inactive for an amount of time over the time interval then the contract allows the holder of the specified address to claim the funds in the contract or take over the contract themselves. The contract has a send functions where the owner can send funds at any time which will reset the time when the next of kin will be able to claim. The time will also reset if the owner sends funds into the contract or if they change the interval. 

An obvious use of this would to get a relative to make an ethereum paper wallet and give you the address. Then you could put funds in the contract with an interval of say a years worth of interval. If you die then you will obviously not able to send funds in or out of the account so after a year they will be able to claim the funds using the account they made.

*Disclaimer:* Now this is my first contract so you should assume that it will fail badly and lock your funds up forever so unless you understand the code please only use it on a testnet so your relatives can claim your delicious testnet funds. I am posting this for feedback purposes only. 

I am using the geth javascript console to do all of the things.

[depricated source pastebin see bellow](http://pastebin.com/2hH4ngvZ)

Compiling: (deprecated due to inheritContract see version 0.02 below)

	var dmsSource = 'contract dms { address owner; address nextOfKin; uint lockDate; uint lockTime; function dms(address otherPerson,uint interval) { owner = msg.sender; nextOfKin = otherPerson; lockTime = interval; lockDate = now + lockTime; } function () { if (msg.sender==owner) { lockDate = now + lockTime; } } function getLockTime() constant returns (uint) { return lockTime; } function getTimeRemaining() constant returns (uint) { if (now < lockDate) return lockDate-now; return 0; } function send(address receiver, uint amount){ if (msg.sender==owner && this.balance >= amount) { lockDate = now + lockTime; receiver.send(amount); log(0); } else log(1); } function setNextOfKin(address otherPerson) { if (msg.sender==owner) { nextOfKin = otherPerson; lockDate = now + lockTime; log(0); } else log(1); } function setLockTime(uint interval) { if (msg.sender==owner) { lockTime = interval; lockDate = now + lockTime; log(0); } else log(1); } function inheritContract(address otherPerson) { if (msg.sender==nextOfKin && now > lockDate) { owner = nextOfKin; nextOfKin = otherPerson; log(0); } else log(1); } function inheritFunds() { if (msg.sender==nextOfKin && now > lockDate) { suicide(nextOfKin); log(0); } else log(1); } event log( uint status ); }';
	var dmsCompiled = web3.eth.compile.solidity(dmsSource);

Deploying with an example owner of  web3.eth.accounts[0] and next of kin web3.eth.accounts[2] with a 30 minute  interval:


	var contractOwner = web3.eth.accounts[0];
	var otherPerson = web3.eth.accounts[2];
	var interval = 60*30;
	var dmsContract = web3.eth.contract(dmsCompiled.dms.info.abiDefinition);
	var dms = dmsContract.new(
	   otherPerson,
	   interval,
	   {
		 from: contractOwner, 
		 data: dmsCompiled.dms.code, 
		 gas: 1000000
	   }, function(e, contract){
		if (typeof contract.address != 'undefined') {
		console.log('Contract mined! address: ' + contract.address + ' transactionHash: ' + contract.transactionHash);
	 } else {console.log(""Contract transaction send: TransactionHash: "" + contract.transactionHash + "" waiting to be mined..."");} })

Keep a record of the address of the contract so you can fetch it later to do this take the compile code above and add:

	var dms = eth.contract(dmsCompiled.dms.info.abiDefinition).at('address of contract');

Adding some funds (remember testnet):

    web3.eth.sendTransaction({from: web3.eth.accounts[0], to: dms.address, value: web3.toWei(1000, ""ether"")});

Checking the balance:

    web3.fromWei(eth.getBalance(dms.address),""ether"");

sending funds out of the contract to web3.eth.accounts[3]:

	var origin = contractOwner;
	var destination = web3.eth.accounts[3];
	var amount = web3.toWei(2, ""ether"");
	var tx = dms.send(destination,amount,{from:origin});


look at the interval, set it and get the time remaining:

	dms.getLockTime({from:eth.accounts[0]});

	dms.setLockTime(999999,{from:contractOwner});

	dms.getTimeRemaining({from:eth.accounts[0]});

Now for the next of kin when the time remaining is 0 

getting control of the contract and specifying a new next of kin, replace ""newOtherPerson"" with the address of well you can guess and otherPerson is your next of kin account. 

    dms.inheritContract(newOtherPerson,{from:otherPerson});

To kill the contract sending the funds to the next of kin account:

    dms.inheritFunds({from:otherPerson});

These will hopefully only work if its done by the next of kin once the time interval is up. If operations that should fail fail then they will log some data equal to 1 otherwise 0 for success. Which I'm viewing with:

    eth.getTransactionReceipt(tx).logs[0].data

Where tx is the transaction that called the contract. 

Please if you find any obvious bugs let me know. I am just messing around using https://chriseth.github.io/browser-solidity/ to check for syntax errors, if someone can recommend a good ide for this please let me know also.

Clearing up some misconceptions about the recent hacks/thefts,"Recently, a few people were victims of thefts where their funds were stolen because an attacker was able to use their RPC interface to access the funds in their unlocked accounts remotely:

https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/3ird55/holy_shit_my_eth_accounts_been_hacked/

There seems to be some misunderstandings in that thread about what makes you vulnerable (I myself was probably the most confused!), so I’m going to try to clear it up here. This is the best of my understanding, so I’d appreciate if knowledgeable people would point out if I say anything wrong or misleading here:

1. In order to be vulnerable you have to run geth with the flag `--rpcaddr 0.0.0.0`. This flag tells geth that it should feel free to accept connections from any IP address. This means that anyone on the internet can use your geth client through the RPC interface. You still have to unlock your accounts locally, but as soon as an account is unlocked anyone on the internet can send out all the money in that account. 

2. The default value for `rpcaddr` is `127.0.0.1`, i.e. if you don’t specify anything only connections from your local computer is accepted.

3. Setting `--rpccorsdomain “http://mydapp.com”` is good practice but only affects the way your browser talks to the RPC interface. This flag will not protect you if you have set `rpcaddr` to `0.0.0.0`. All this flag does is that geth communicates with the browser and says something like “Hey, if you’re a browser then I would appreciate it if you only allow mydapp.com to initiate connections to my RPC interface”. If an attacker is using something other than a browser to communicate with the RPC interface this message is ignored.

4. You don’t have to (and shouldn't!) change `rpcaddr` to use dapps. What talks to geth is your web browser that normally lives on the local machine. So when using a dapp like Groupgnosis, use the flag `--rpccorsdomain ""http://groupgnosis.com""` (as per instructions) and don’t touch the `rpcaddr` settings.

So, in summary: 

* It’s very dangerous to set `rpcaddr` to `0.0.0.0` as this will allow anyone in the world to steal funds from any unlocked accounts on your geth client.

Holy shit my eth accounts been hacked,"I had around 399 ether in an account and today deployed some contracts to the main chain, then while browsing an explorer I noticed someone has drained my account in 39.x ether increments.

See: http://explorer.etherapps.info/address/0xd0f9597811b0b992bb7d3757aa25b4c2561d32e2

Fuck!!

So bummed right now, wonder who http://explorer.etherapps.info/address/0xfe6404ba34ea4c30538ff4d058f4bf883220fd79 is. 😢

There goes all my ether I bought for developing dapps. I wonder how they took my funds. 

**Edit:** I didn't intend to be alarmist, just quite bummed.

**Update:** I've moved my remaining funds to a new account `0xb531d16c7397c6eca613cae954cfe0a46a241666` and ~~turned off my full node (which had open RPC ports - lesson learnt :( )~~ Dont store ether in accounts on my full node. It would seem that the perp is stealing more from others see account transactions above.

**Update/clarification:** Yes I can confirm I had a digital Ocean droplet running geth with  --rpc --rpcaddr 0.0.0.0 --rpcport 8545

Basically just asking for trouble, I used it as an eth network API server, I should never have kept my private key on that box. Eventually I forgot about the perma RPC and unlocked the account to make a transaction shortly after that my account had been drained.

**Final update: the team at ethereum.org have helpfully published a related blogpost to better inform users (some of whom, like me, should have known better) http://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/3itz1f/insecurely_configured_geth_with_no_firewall_and/ **",41.0,2015-08-28 19:01:20,0.81
A proposal on the effective use of address 0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000,"There has clearly been a non-trivial amount of Ether lost in transactions sent to 0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000 - which I will refer to from this point as (0^40)

So long as we are all in agreement that this address is not intended to be a private address would it be possible in an upcoming release of geth/eth to make it so that transactions sent to that address act in a similar way to how the **ping** command is used in IP networking, that is to return any Ether sent to (0^40) back to the sender's address. Allowing this functionality would not only serve to protect users from an accidental loss of Ether but may also serve as a valuable diagnostic function.

With the development of applications that run on the Ethereum platform a major focus right now having such a safety-net in place while developing and debugging your software makes a lot of sense to me.

Colony.io makes it easy for people all over the world to build companies together online.,"[**Colony.io**](http://colony.io)

The hierarchical company is outdated. It is inefficient at scale and is incompatible with the kinds of distributed, scalable organisations the internet should allow.

Colony provides a new approach: a software platform for web and mobile which enables peer-to-peer organisations by providing structure and discipline. 


**The Problem**


Talent is highly distributed, yet opportunity is highly centralised.

Many people would like to start or work on startups, and though starting up is easier than ever, there are still significant barriers to entry. 

Consequently, the passion, talent, and energy these people might otherwise commit to commercial projects are often channeled into online communities, free open source software projects and other hobbies.


**Our Solution**


Colony is a social collaboration platform for distributed organisations. Users can start projects online and build a workforce to help make them a reality. 

Because it aligns the incentives of the workforce around being productive, it is possible for people anywhere in the world to work on a project without the need for hierarchical management.

The platform incentivises users to compete to be the most skilled and productive workers by distributing cryptoequity in proportion to the value of each user’s contribution.

The platform automates the project management process, aggregating the collective intelligence of the workforce in suggesting tasks, making decisions, assigning tasks to the best candidates and providing feedback on people’s work.

Every aspect of the platform employs game mechanics and behavioural design to ensure a compelling experience which encourages repeat engagement.


**The Ask**


We're looking for awesome projects to alpha test the platform. If you've got such a project and a small engaged group of collaborators, please do get in touch.

We're also looking for top notch angular and node devs to contribute.",44.0,2015-08-25 08:37:40,0.87
Name Registrar is awesome!,"I was playing around with this, and just got a name registrar working! (""unofficially"")

In your geth console:

    registrar = GlobalRegistrar.at('0x5564886ca2c518d1964e5fcea4f423b41db9f561');

To test, see if you can resolve ""linagee"" to my ethereum address:

    registrar.addr('linagee');

To set up your own name and give it a test: (replace redditorname with your name or anything)

    registrar.reserve.sendTransaction('redditorname', {from: eth.accounts[0]});

    registrar.setAddress.sendTransaction('redditorname', eth.accounts[0], true, {from: eth.accounts[0]});

Now, whenever you want to send me an ether, you only need to do this!

    eth.sendTransaction({from: eth.accounts[0], to: registrar.addr('linagee'), value: web3.toWei(1, 'ether'), gas: 21000});

You'll need to run the GlobalRegistrar.at() line every time you start geth until this gets hard coded.

You can also replace the second parameter of .setAddress() above with a contract's address to ""call it by name""!

Groupgnosis Prediction Market is Live; Trading has Begun.,"[GroupGnosis](http://groupgnosis.com)


First, a couple of warnings: This is the ""frontier"" stage. We cannot make any guarantees that GroupGnosis is working as intended. Anyway, we are proud to announce today the launch of a proof of concept of an aspect of the GroupGnosis prediction market platform that we are building. The first market is on the amount of $USD that Augur will raise in their pre-sale. You can buy two types of shares: long and short. Long shares will appreciate in value if Augur raises more USD while short shares are worth more if Augur raises less money. The exact payout for long shares: *(total_amount_raised/20M)ETH* and for short shares: *(1 - (total_amount_raised/20M))ETH*. The maximum value of one share is 1 Ether. Currently trades are restricted to 100ETH per buy.

2 out of 3 people will be required to agree upon and post the outcome of this event. We currently control access to all 3 accounts of the oracle smart contract. So far Vitalik Buterin, Robin Hanson & Edmund Edgar (of realitykeys.com) have in principal agreed to be these oracles. We are in the process of handing over control of these accounts to them. If 2 of the 3 are unable to agree upon an outcome and post it, we reserve the right to appoint other oracles, in consultation with the existing oracles, to get this done. The oracles can post their submissions within minutes or hours of the official announcement by Augur of the total amount raised in USD in the crowdfunding, however the oracle smart contract gives them until November 1st 2015 to act.



GroupGnosis is a prediction market platform that will power a collection of different front ends, oracle solutions, market maker contracts and various types of prediction market logic and algorithms. Some users of the GroupGnosis platform will use its components to build prediction markets for specific topics. Others can  fill an available role on the platform, such as trader, proposition writer, market maker, data feed provider, oracle, proposition decider, insurer, arbitrator, investor, etc.
The goal is for everything to become trustless, or at least fully transparent, but we are not there yet.



**Edit:** By unlocking your account the DAPP has full control over your account. So it should be done with caution in general. You can view the market (more soon) without unlocking an account - but than you can't do any transactions. As soon as better tools for access control will evolve we will use them of course.

Augur REP Pools will centralize voting and defeat the point of REP. Is the Augur model flawed?,"Already we've seen posts about people 'too lazy' to report on outcomes, and worried about losing their REP for failing to report.

So we've seen a group who is creating a REP Pool who will vote on outcomes on behalf of REP owners who put their REP on deposit with the pool.  All of a sudden we'll have a centralized pool with > 50% of REP.   Then the system becomes totally centralized, defeating the point of REP altogether.  And even if there are 5 REP pools with 20% each, that's still just 5 trusted oracles.   Why not just use the Gnosis model in that case?

Seems like REP Pooling will lead to centralized oracles, and defeat the purpose of REP being used as a decentralized voting mechanism.  I've been thinking about buying REP, but find this concerning. Thoughts?",20.0,2015-08-24 19:11:22,0.92

Understanding the Ethereum Consensus Issue,"Thanks to the Ethereum developers who fixed the consensus issue quickly. We’re happy to see the network is stable and reliable again.


* Let's see what happened: http://frontier.ether.camp/block/116522
In the cursed block, #116522 there were 2 transactions. In the first transaction we see the last operation of the contract is a SUICIDE, whereby the specification of SUICIDE should eliminate the contract.
http://frontier.ether.camp/transaction/7476afface2667/vmtrace#58


* Using the ether.camp explorer again, in   http://frontier.ether.camp/transaction/51826f28e829cb we can see the 2nd transaction asked to invoke the aforementioned contract but that contract doesn’t have any trace because that contract is dead, due to SUICIDE. 


* One of the implementations actually didn't do
it that way but was waiting till end of the block
and only there was eliminating the SUICIDE contract.
So the second transaction has a different run
and yet a consensus break.


* This is just a short summary showing you what actually happened, 
and how a bug can be fixed in just a few hours (in quicker in the future). 


Enjoy the ride,

Misinformation about ETH supply and inflation rate,"There's a lot of misinformation on various forums (bitcointalk, reddit, twitter) regarding the target supply of ETH and the expected inflation rate. I understand that the exact amount of ETH is dependent on when POW gets replaced by POS but the community could really benefit from a clear explanation of what the developers are thinking when it comes to total supply and the inflation rate. From what I've read, I believe ~90M ETH is a reasonable supply target but I'd love for that to be confirmed. I'd like to see a good blog post about this topic. 

BTW - I really appreciate this community and it's a breath of fresh air coming from BTC.

If the above command looks scary, it should. Don't trust random things people tell you to type into your terminal without careful scrutiny. You could leave bits of it off the end and see what various stages do though.

explained:

curl - grab stuff from the web (which is actually from the ethereum blockchain since this is the explorer)

paste - truncate all lines down into one string (needed because sed operates on one line at a time typically)

sed - remove the pre tag and everything before it (get just the blockchain payload)

xxd - convert hex (""0x12345"") into actual binary

""mpg321 -"" - play an mp3 from xxd binary (as to what - spoilers!)

Please update your geth client to 1.0.1-latest!,"This is your last warning, update your client **now** or have your ether be lost in the blockhole, **forever**.

There's currently 2739 in the `0x0000....00` account. I'm refunding anyone who's send ether to this account **UP TO THIS MOMENT** from my own pocket (even though it's your own bloody fault!).

Here's the list of transactions and their senders for your reference. If you're sending ether to this address after **NOW** I will **NOT** refund. 

EDIT: Since all my ether must come out of the premine (which I don't have access to, yet) I obviously can't do anything ATM. Will send asap :)

"Introducing Terra Nullius, the first* interactive Ethereum contract","*as far as I know.

The gas limit has finally hit a point where meaningful contracts can be created! Join me in celebration by claiming your spot on Terra Nullius. The contract will record your address, the block height at which you staked your claim, and a message from you to the future.

To interact with the contract, first load [this script](http://pastebin.com/N5ANMPSy) into your Geth console. This will give you access to an object called `terra_nullius`. From there, you can get the number of claims, see each existing claim, and stake your own claim. Here are the relevant commands:

    terra_nullius.number_of_claims.call()

    terra_nullius.claims.call(number)

(Note that this is zero-indexed, so 0 represents the first claim.)

    terra_nullius.claim(""my message here!"", {from: eth.coinbase, gas: 300000})

(Note that this will cost you gas! The longer the message, the higher the cost.)

And that's all there is to it! Happy Ethereum launch, everyone.",25.0,2015-08-07 21:36:47,0.87

Is the Augur Rep Sale A Good Idea to Get Involved With?,"Let's break down the numbers of the REP sale a bit.  The founders have set aside 16% of the total REP for themselves.  The founders are, I believe, 7 people.  They estimate they will raise about 3 million.  So at 16% that is $480,000 for the founders.  That is $480k divided by 7 so each founder will get a windfall of about = 68K.  But also the Rep sale will be used to fund their salaries so the remaining 3 million minus 480,000 will go to them too.  2.52 Million dollars.  So yeah I think Joey and the team should give a little detail as to how the funds will be used, especially considering that Augur is already built right?  So the argument that they need the money for a crowdsale to spur development and not a straight up investment is a little weak -- which means that they may be subject to the focus of the government later, which means those who invest may lose their funds?  So what will happen to the project if the government comes after them for a security offering and not a crowdsale?  There seems to be much less due diligence here than with the Ethereum team, who put aside 1 million dollars for potential legal issues.  Plus the Ethereum team had to buy their ethers.  Plus Vitalik only has 150 thousand ethers.  With 78 million total Ethers Vitalik has about .2% of the total, and he used his own money to buy them!  And the Ethereum team used the money from the crowdsale to actually build the platform.  What is Augur building at this point?  Augur is already built right?  And they already imported 95% of the project from Truthcoin I believe.  The Truthcoin guy does seem like he is probably insufferable to work with based on comments I have read from him, but it is clear that he developed all this -- I think the Augur guys just tweaked it a little and took it on the road and promoted it like it was their horse.  Is this a money grab?  I don't know.  All that said I will still probably invest but it does not seem all on the up and up to me, not like Ethereum -- which has always seemed on the up and up to me based on integrity of Vitalik.  So I will probably invest a lot less than if it seemed like it was total on the up and up  - I will invest because being the first Augur may achieve network effects, even if it is a sort of money grab and I do wonder if it will be sufficiently decentralized in case it has to face and government scrutiny.  This post is a ramble but I guess what I am saying to the Augur team is that I have concerns and that I want more details before the August 17th sale (which I will probably invest in despite all my griping).

"If Ethereum adopts Casper Proof of Stake, it is very likely that it will become more decentralized.","This thread is a response to /u/itistoday criticisms of Casper, which can be found [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/3ff8g5/introducing_casper_the_friendly_ghost/ctpezfx)

Lets compare the censorship resistance properties of Casper against those of PoW.

In PoW, any coalition of miners with more than 50% of the hashing power can censor the remaining miners by ignoring blocks that do not have coinbase addresses that they recognize. This costs them nothing, and it leads to an increased transaction fee revenue. To prevent censorship in PoW, you (the anti-censorship coalition) must have strictly more mining power than the censoring coalition.

In Casper, any coalition of validators with more than 50% of the bonded stake can censor the remaining validators by ignoring their blocks. This is at their expense and reduces their revenue, as Casper makes it directly very costly to ignore blocks from bonded validators. To prevent censorship in Casper, you must have a sufficiently large minority of bonded stake to make the cost of censorship too high for the censors to bear, or else have strictly more bonded stake than the censoring coalition. 

From a purely economic perspective, censorship is expensive in Casper and profitable in PoW. From a purely fault tolerance perspective, censorship is just as easy in PoW as in Casper. The realistic analysis, though, is to use economically-weighted byzantine fault tolerance. **Specifically, we need to assume that wealth and power is concentrated in both Casper and PoW, since they are both public economic consensus protocols, and then ask how the majority of nodes with a minority of voting power are represented. The majority of nodes with a minority of mining/staking power have the ability to prevent censorship by the minority of nodes with a majority of power in Casper (or at least they have the ability to make it very costly), while they are powerless to prevent censorship in PoW.** It is in this sense that Casper is more decentralized than PoW.

The only advantage of PoW over Casper in terms of censorship resistance is that there is nothing a censoring coalition can do prevent an anti-censorship coalition with more mining power from creating and publishing a better fork. In Casper, the bonding transactions of new validators can be censored (at the direct expense of censors, if some already-bonded validators aren't participating in censorship), potentially preventing a large anti-censorship coalition from forming. 

In conclusion, censorship is a problem for Casper only if the censoring coalition gets sufficiently close to 100% of the bonded validators that they can bear the cost of censorship. Censorship is a problem for PoW so long as the censoring coalition has more than 50% of mining power. However, censorship can become a permanent problem for Casper, in the event that the censoring coalition controls sufficiently close to 100% of the bonded stake. 

Because this is indeed a reasonable concern, Casper will likely employ the non-economic means of preventing censorship described by Vitalik in [this blog post](https://blog.ethereum.org/2015/06/06/the-problem-of-censorship/), to be safe. Censorship resistance has always been a guiding principle of Casper's architecture, and we will work very hard to guarantee this property.

Please remember that we need to switch to proof-of-stake not only because it is much cheaper to secure, or because transactions can be finalized quickly, but also because it is a necessary stepping stone to blockchain scaling. ",23.0,2015-08-03 08:09:03,0.81

Mining Ethereum on Windows 7 & 8,"Update: These exact steps are CONFIRMED to work on Windows 7, 8.1 & 10 and yield 24 Mh/s on a Radeon 280x.

I gave up trying to build anything from source and just decided to download the installable versions. It took some pulling of hair and gnashing of teeth but I got it working.

1. Download and install Geth installer here: http://www.github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum (the automated development build)
2. Download and install Ethereum here: https://build.ethdev.com/builds/Windows%20C%2B%2B%20develop%20branch/ (the latest Windows c++ build is a .exe file at the bottom)
3. Then download the genesis JSON file (http://jev.io/genesis_block.json) and save it somewhere (it's easiest to save it in the same folder as Geth actually)
4. Start Geth and open a new account from the DOS CMD line: ""geth account new"" (save the account name and password you use). Exit that (CRTL+C)
5. Start Geth with the genesis JSON ""geth --genesis [path_to_genesis_JSON_filename] and let it catch up to whatever the current block is on http://stats.ethdev.com. Exit that (CRTL+C)
6. Start GETH again with the RPC API: ""geth --rpc"". Now we are ready to start mining.
7. Open another DOS terminal and start the miner ""ethminer -G --opencl-device 0"" and if everything goes right you should be mining away
8. One more thing, the Geth terminal is super clunky. If you want to actually use it as a terminal you have to open another instance of the DOS terminal and type ""geth attach"". This gives you another Geth window into which you can actually type the javascript API commands.
9. The hashrate of the network is climbing so solo mining is becoming difficult.  Check out http://ethpool.org/ for joining a mining pool if needed.

Note: On Windows 10 you may need to activate the Windows Time service from the ""Start Menu > Services"" and set setup to automatic.  Some users report that this service is disabled by default in Windows 10.

Here is an easy way how you can help us crashing the network:

1) You need a synced node running with an unlocked address.

2) I set up a contract which does some computation if you send him some gas

3) send a 62k gas tx with data: 0x47966bc2 to the address of the contract: 0xd1ea2964214e0345a86da92ecbc7e917ffcd7e37

4) Do it often:)

...################...

Noob guide ;) :

All you have to do for helping us is do the following steps.

* If you use geth, type in:

*spam = function() { i = 0; eth.sendTransaction({to: ""0xf0adc306641b0ec9a4d159c9f6a1f29d5b97672c"", from: eth.coinbase, data: ""0x3ba15036""}); while(i < 3000) { eth.sendTransaction({to: ""0xd1ea2964214e0345a86da92ecbc7e917ffcd7e37"", from: eth.coinbase, data: ""0x47966bc2"", gas: 62000}); i += 1 } return(1); }*

* execute the spam with:

*spam()*

This will get you 5000 Ether from a faucet contract and then send 3000 tx to the spam contract, which does some computation.

* Do the execution of *spam()* over and over again, after a while please restart geth to clear the tx pool.

Ethereum: Did we just crowd fund the internets $11 Trillion I.O.T?,"The estimated economic impact of the IOT is $11 trillion by 2025. But Ethereum does more, much more. Lets take a look at a bigger picture.

If you have been following industry news you will know that the worlds tech giants are focused in on this space. With a potential slice of $11 trillion you can understand why. But how will they make money from the software? It may not be the software. Analysts have indicated that the IOT will need to be open source. It will be through the hardware. Devices, chips and microprocessors.  http://www.cnet.com/news/internet-of-things-frenzy-drives-chipmaker-land-grab/

http://www.cnet.com/news/samsung-launches-artik-chips-for-internet-of-things/

So how will the tech giants navigate?

Corporations are struggling to come to terms with open source software. Decentralisation is an unfamiliar concept that terminates the existence of many centralised models. They imagine building software worth billions and then having to “give it away”. An ancient article (2014) that gives great insight into the squabbles over riches. I am grateful we have the “Ethereum foundation”.
http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/07/08/standard-behavior-in-an-internet-goldrush/?_php=true&_type=blogs&_r=1

 http://www.cbronline.com/news/enterprise-it/software/broadcom-quits-intels-open-interconnect-consortium-4402726

What more can we learn from the relationship with Samsung and IBM? They forked Ethereum to research and develop the internet of things and it was a success. The reason they forked the software was because Ethereums testnet was not stable enough. If you have been following the breadcrumbs there has been an unofficial nod that they may now be using the Ethereum core for devices. This means, they must either mine or buy Ether to interact with the network. By using our chain they will address their issues of cost, scalability, longevity, privacy and security. 

Now lets take a look at the relationship with the W3C. There has been some very, very interesting things going on here.  Without jumping to conclusions I am going to observe for now. 


""Given these moves, the market may not wait around for open-source standards to finally get everyone on the same command line. With as much as $11 trillion at stake, it could just take the fastest route and rely on Google (or Apple) to deliver IoT products. (Enter Ethereum)
Either way, customers will be the real winners. McKinsey estimates that, of the enormous potential IoT fortune, 90% of the value will go to customers, not vendors—though even a 10% sliver that $11 trillion pie would be plenty for a dominant player to feast on. At least it will be, whenever it is that the connected future arrives.” -Excerpt from http://readwrite.com/2015/06/29/internet-of-things-11-trillion-obstacles-open-source

Its mid July 2015 and we are leading the way ahead of global tech giants. Professionals from across the industry are now attracted to what we are doing. Academic leaders are also studying this space and we are being researched in universities by the brightest minds across the globe. Each day we stumble across new projects and gifted developers honouring our blockchain. 

So much excitement in this space and its only a fraction of what Ethereum can do. Right now we are the worlds best kept secret.

"No, we're not blacking out the reddit, but read this anyway","***TL;DR: Reddit is not friendly to its volunteer admins, and a lot of subreddits are [going private](http://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/gadgets-and-tech/news/reddit-in-revolt-moderators-shut-down-popular-parts-of-the-website-in-solidarity-with-fired-friend-10363099.html) in protest. We're not, but we encourage you to join our forums http://forum.ethereum.org/*** 

---

As you probably noticed today, hundreds of subreddits are going private following a [breakdown in communication](
http://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/gadgets-and-tech/news/reddit-in-revolt-moderators-shut-down-popular-parts-of-the-website-in-solidarity-with-fired-friend-10363099.html) between the larger subreddits' admins and reddit's owners. 

We will not be making this sub private, however it's good to reflect on what reddit actually is especially in light of what Ethereum could enable in the future. 

Reddit works like this: anyone can come in and browse. Anyone can build their subreddit at no cost, and others can then participate. Reddit maintains the software and the servers. All the moderation work of the ±10K subreddits, worth millions of dollars a months, is done by unpaid volunteers while 100% of the advertising revenues goes to the Reddit owners. 

The Reddit owners barely interact with the subbreddit volunteers, if at all. While there is a cute alien and everything is 'free' and and friendly-looking, the reality is that reddit is a business, and the reddit owners can pull the plug on anything they feel like, and actually are the only 'real' admins of the entire thing. The large subreddit mods are learning this the hard way today. 

If this sounds like a very centralized model, it's because it is. It's actually just a variation on the facebook business model, where if you are not paying for the product, then **you** are the product. 

Until fully decentralized platforms equivalent are in place on Ethereum, I think it's worth continuing operating the reddit and the various other social media platforms we administer, however, I strongly encourage you to check out our forums at http://forum.ethereum.org/ where information is easily browsed and the search function actually works (unlike reddit).

Ethereum Subreddit Rules,"After a year and half in operations, this subreddit is closing on 5,000 readers and averages 150,000 page views per month. 

The fact throughout the first year and half, we only ever had to ban 17 accounts (mostly for posting bot-spam) is a testament as to the quality and maturity of our community. I personally take great pride in the large set of on-topic, concise, clear posts that are genuinely helpful to newcomers. 

It is our intention to keep it that way - we want readers to be able to jump in a thread and gather the information they need quickly, without having to scan through 30 pages of repeated low-value content, or worse, page after page of personal insults. If this sounds familiar, it's because it's the same process of manual curation that has taken place since day one on http://forum.ethereum.org/, and has worked very well so far.

Recently, there has been a number of accounts on this subreddit that have taking liberties with our community - and it has made it very difficult for us to justify some post being removed while others stayed in place. We had a chat internally, and agreed we needed rules that could be applied fairly and to everyone.

So, here are the rules. They are probably obvious etiquette to 99.999% of you, but now our team can curate the subreddit knowing it has a 'gold standard' to refer to:

* All submissions must be made from accounts at least 7 days old with a minimum of 3 karma
* All submissions must clearly relate to Ethereum in some fashion. Submissions relating to 'crypto-related' stories, by themselves, do not qualify, unless they directly relate to Ethereum as well (in which case please consider explaining how they relate in the title). What's not on topic will be deleted.
* No ads, or links to commercial offerings
* Posts created by accounts that self-delete immediately will be deleted immediately - no 'drive by posting'
* Buying, selling and price discussion should go on /r/ethtrader, a 3rd party subreddit not moderated by us
* No signatures
* No adhominem (personal insults) - all ad hominems will lead to permanbans without warning, regardless of 'who started it'. This is not kindergarten. 
* No derailing threads
* No flooding with multiple threads when one would have sufficed. Always use the search function and do not create new threads when one already exists. Duplicated threads will be deleted.
* No flooding threads with subsequent messages if you're OP (ie 'bumping flood')
* No abuse of the editor function (use formatting for clarity, not to draw giant letters across the screen)
* Spamming will lead to deletion and permaban
* Sockpuppeting will lead to an immediate permaban
* ""Trolling"" in all its forms leads to permaban without warning

What constitute trolling, spamming, sockpuppeting etc is defined by a combination of the number of 'reports' a post received in combination with the moderator's personal discretion, whom we trust to curate the content on this subreddit to the highest of standard.

We invite criticism and critique, requiring that it be respectful in tone and content. All decisions by moderators are final. 

Moderators are /u/vbuterin, /u/Ursium, /u/thehighfiveghost, /u/Blue-Chain and /u/avsa and /u/crypto_jesus

And finally: **be kind to each other.** We're in a small community, and what we write here is how people from outside the space will perceive us.

Founder salaries,"[Referencing this comment from vitalik](http://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/39fi0c/in_spirit_of_communication_update_requested_on/cs3muxb)

""The highest salary is $190,000, followed by $180,000, followed by something in the 150s (I personally am not even in the top 3; mine is 137k CHF/year). For refrence, Gavin Andresen's salary was ~$210,000 when he was working for the Bitcoin Foundation; it got published somewhere and I have a link in an old post on reddit. The people who earn the most per hour are probably our external security auditing partners that make $300/h.""

Guys, this is outrageous. No founder of a startup I know takes home these kind of salaries. You all have significant equity in the Ethereum. Especially now that you have funding trouble.

Vitalik, do you think it makes sense that you make 150k usd a year? Do you think anyone else would pay you this rate other than ethereum foundation?

Fork update,"Over the past few days we've been fighting of the fork and it seems like we've finally succeeded in fending off of the baddies :-)

Here's a recap of what happened and what we've done to fix the issues:

1. AVSA created a transaction which [forked the network](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/37b849/did_we_get_a_fork_between_eth_and_geth_eth/). Py + C++ and Go went off on their own 

2. We [fixed up the issue and deployed](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/37bnbv/important_fork_update/) the new versions of Geth

3. The network was terribly sharded and attempts to get the network on agreement again failed in it's current form.

4. Over much debate, consideration and thoughtful planning we patched up the downloader and upgrade mechanisms in Geth. As soon as Geth started to drop bad peers the network slowely but steadily recovered from this terrible (fun!) event.

We've learned a great deal from this event and has taught us a lot about upgrading. One thing that has been particularly awesome to see is how the [community](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/37l5xj/who_is_0x82b27dbe07d34fb96309d2306e2729b6c5d155ff/) (successfully) attempted to fix the broken network by connecting to each other and form a new stable network. Thank you guys, you've been a great help! :-)

"We broke the network hard, and this is what happened","_(or at least my version of it)_

1. One of the devs, /u/avsa created a transaction on the testnet that resulted in a hard-fork between the clients. This was listed as a Grand Prize for Olympic pre-release that Vitalik [blogged about](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/37bnbv/important_fork_update/crlafr9)
1. The problem was discovered to be lack of detail over how unused memory should be overwritten after a message call return
1. Developers discussed and clarified how this should be handled, with pull requests to update the clients and yellow paper. [related reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/37bnbv/important_fork_update/)
1. Geth was updated to ignore the bad chain hash, which exposed [an issue](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/1128) with the networking behavior in regard to misbehaving peers
1. Unable to connect to better peers caused network isolation, making it difficult to locate and sync the correct chain. This was solved by adding more public peers that had the correct chain and improved peer logic.
1. We are waiting for the good chain to substantially out-work the bad chain. Combined with updated clients, the network should stabilize quickly

Additionally, during this time, block import/export was observed to be [consuming lots of memory](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/issues/1119), so fixes are being issued to address this.

What we gained out of this is several very beneficial things:

* Practiced disaster scenario and recovery without bumping the protocol version
* Found a critical concensus bug
* Refined peer download behaviour in hostile environments. This is hard to model locally, so live networks give us valuable insight
* Addressed import efficiency, which becomes more important as the blockchain grows
* Marian's net stats module was refactored to be faster and similar updates are due for the dashboard at https://stats.ethdev.com

All the developers handled everything in a calm and professional manner, which made uncovering problems quick. Although the network is still recovering, we think we have a handle on the issues that were exposed. A new version of geth should be out soon with more fixes, and it's important that everyone updates their version frequently as we see a fair amount of bug reports from old versions :)",50.0,2015-05-27 22:32:06,0.89
IMPORTANT: Fork update,"TL;DR There was a fork and the new Olympic release can be found [here](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/releases/latest)

As many of you may have noticed a fork has been created (yay) and we've been able to reproduce the fork and traced down the differences between the clients.

This means that the miners that have been mining on the go-fork will loose all their hard earned Ethers from the past few hours (I'm truly sorry!). The fork happened at 5/25/2015 @ 8:21pm (UTC). This does show how incredibly important it is that we have a testnet for people to play with, test and exploit and shows that had we released a few months ago this would have resulted in a hard fork.

We've made the following changes to the YP and Go client to fix the issues:

* https://github.com/obscuren/go-ethereum/commit/b3578fc944eb845ebc72245b5e6366b045b5e5dd
* https://github.com/ethereum/yellowpaper/commit/972c8f35b3baa07eb10502882a254167cfb8455c

This update fixes two things:

1. [Hardcode](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/blob/develop/core/blocks.go#L7) a block's header hash so that when it encounters it in your blockchain revert back the **valid** parent and from there on get back on the right track. All clients which catch up from anything previous to the **invalid** block won't have any issue and might not even notice the bad chain. 
2. Fixes an issue within the Ethereum VM's memory when doing a sub-call (op codes CALL & CALLCODE). When doing a sub-call you reserve a bit of memory for the sub-calls return data and write to that memory region when the sub-call returns. The subtle change is that previously Geth would zero out the memory and then write, now it doesn't zero and write directly. Here's an example of the before and after

Before:

    Mem before call   = [1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1]
    Sub calls returns = [6,6]
    Mem after call    = [6,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]
    
After:

    Mem before call   = [1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1]
    Sub calls returns = [6,6]
    Mem after call    = [6,6,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1]
    
This caused a consensus issue between the clients when such a CALL(CODE) was performed.

~~I've heard that a person named ""Phillip Str"" initially exploited the issue and therefor deserves the be in mentioned in the Genesis block and gets one of the Olympic ETH prices. To confirm this is truly you we need a transaction from 0x38cd6ac0e09c517ab75267c6bc76e5bb8baf14d0 to the zero'd address (0x00000000000000000000000000000000000000) with ""Phillip Str"" in the data field.~~

**UPDATE: It was Alex van de Sande.** [/u/avsa](https://www.reddit.com/user/avsa) please confirm as detailed above and replace ""Phillip"" with your own name :-)

Do note that after the update you'll see quite a few messages with ""INVALID block #446189 (38f5bbbffd74804820ffa4bab0cd540e9de229725afb98c1a7e57936f4a714bc)"". This is because some nodes haven't updated.

"Introducing eDollar, the ultimate stablecoin built on Ethereum","As someone who's been obsessed with pegged cryptocurrencies for the past 6 months, I was delighted to find out that even with just my meager programming skills, developing for Ethereum is so incredibly easy that I've been able to come up with what I believe is close to being the perfect design for a stable cryptocurrency.

In short, the eDollar is a token pegged to the USD that is issued in a manner similar to bitUSD, and that has a DAO (called Maker) backing it and providing liquidity similar to the system of liquidity providing custodians that NuBits uses. 

The purpose of eDollar is to give average people a currency they can use on the ethereum network to interact with dapps, without having to worry about insane volatility like with bitcoin and other 1st gen cryptocurrencies. It also gives ethereum investors the possibility to take leveraged ETH positions (albeit with very high collateral requirements).

To see a full (but rough) description of the features of the eDollar design, you can check out this post on the Maker forum: http://makerdao.com/index.php?topic=4.0 (the forum design is really fancy, I know :p)

To see the eDollar contract with comments, check: http://makerdao.com/peggedCoinRemake.sol

To see the test frontend http://makerdao.com/edollarfrontendtest.html#

(edit I should add that the front end is not currently set up to work with the latest version of the contract, so the dapp can't actually be tested atm without adding new ABI calls)

These are the basic pointers of the design:

- If EUSD is currently trading above 99 cents, then anyone can issue new EUSD by putting up 3 USD worth of ether as collateral for every 1 EUSD (300% collateral requirement).

- After issuing EUSD, the issuer gets a debt that has to be covered by burning an equal amount of EUSD if they want to get their collateral back.

- If the collateral/debt ratio for a position ever goes below 150% anyone can perform a ""hard margin call"", getting the entire collateral balance in return for covering the debt.

- In practice this should never happen due to the existence of Maker (trading as MKR), the ""guardian DAO"". Maker has the ability to perform soft margin calls and forced covers.

- a soft margin call can be done on any position with a c/d ratio below 200%, and with penalty of up to 5%. The issuer will get the remaining collateral after the value of the debt and the penalty (if any) has been subtracted from it.

- a forced cover enables Maker to cover any position at the market rate as determined by the feed. This ability ensures that Maker can guarantee liquidity for users who wants to get out of eDollar.

- Maker will earn income by staking with the eDollar collateral. Only a small portion of the collateral will be used for this since it gets locked up for 3 months at a time. A system will be in place to ensure that the collateral cannot be stolen by Maker, and that it only gains access to the profits from the staking.

- The profits will be used to buy diversified collateral, such as gold vouchers from DGX.io. This diversified collateral will be used as a last resort in case the ether price crashes so fast that some positions become undercollateralized before they can be margin called (known as a black swan event).

- The money will also be used to pay for price feeds from Augur, and to fund infrastructure such as the EtherEx foundation and the Ethereum Foundation, as well as be distributed to MKR holders as dividends.

- Maker can upgrade its own guardian contract, and update vital parameters of the eDollar contract (such as changing the source of price feeds, or changing collateral requirements). To prevent abuse these actions have to be primed with a delay (which can be several months for extremely vital functions), so that users will be able to notice and withdraw their funds from the contract if this power is being misused.

- To give users some amount of privacy, a simple coinjoin system will be avaiable soon after launch, called Shuffle. This should provide privacy equal to that of Darkcoin, but the eventual goal will be to have a zerocoin level privacy implementation that makes all eDollar transactions 100% anonymous by default.

- Shapeshift will be natively integrated in the UI to allow users to seamlessly send and receive eDollar as bitcoin.

- A bunch of features to make life easier for the user will be implemented in the eDollar front end, some based on bitcoin/shapeshift (shopping, debit cards) and some being curated lists of ethereum dapps that accept eDollar (gambling dapps and possibly augur and other prediction markets).

- eDollar will trade against bitcoin and ether on etherex, and will also trade on a single centralized exchange where high liquidity will be ensured by Maker and the centralized market making company Cryptowall.

- other assets can be created by anyone using the same system, but be collateralized by eDollar instead in order to reduce risk (since it's easier to determine the right collateral requirements when the collateral isn't volatile). This opens up the possibility to trade any asset on the ethereum block chain. Maker will initially create and keep liquid AAPL, gold and CNY on EtherEx as a proof of concept that anything can be done as long as there's a price feed.

I made this post and the intentionally hyperbole claims in the hopes that I'll provoke the armchair economists out of the woodwork to start a discussion on how risky this type of pegged asset it, and what other mechanisms can be put in place to minimize the risk. The great effort of convincing dapps to use eDollar has also yet to begin, and there needs to be a community wide discussion on how to handle metacoin deposits to dapps before they can even implement it. In the long run I'm hoping to have an ongoing discussion about every aspect of eDollar, pegged currencies and other ethereum based assets on makerdao.com, so anyone will have easy access to the different arguments and points of view.",65.0,2015-03-26 21:59:58,0.89

[Paper] Political implications of blockchain technology,"Hi everyone, 

I am thinking about writing my master's thesis about the ""political implications of blockchain technology"". Here I would like to share some of my ideas with you and see whether this topic has enough substance. Your ideas are very welcome. 

Where do you think lies the biggest potential of this technology to change how social interaction and the resolution of conflict among humans is arranged?

What would you say is the core of the innovation that changes how humans get along with each other? My take: Being able to control (hold private keys) assets that are tracked on a distributed ledger that is maintained based on public rules (open source software defining the rules to update the ledger).  

Any ideas you have help! Especially those that are very specific or are substituted by an example or embedded in sociological / political theory. 

Here are my thoughts up to this point: 

1. Money sovereignty: With debt based asset management (today) the control of the asset is transferred from it's owner to either banks or any entity that has control over the bank (e.g. a state). Blockchain technology would allow the owner to fully control his/her assets. This might lead to less influence of the state due to the increasing difficulty of collecting taxes, imposing capital controls etc.

2. A new form of governance: Continuous voting, voting for representatives in specific areas (vote for a health politician etc.). 

3. In my opinion libertarian solutions don't work without the according political culture, not without certain norms and not without social enforcement of these norms (outlawing that is not only based on the interests of the individuals that practice the outlawing but on a social norm they follow that does not increase their personal profit). In a global society where the individual does not depend as much on ""its"" group like in Rothbard's ancient Ireland the cultural basis for a state free society is at least more difficult to establish. Blockchain technology can help here in two ways: 

3a) Less trust necessary among anonymous individuals: The lack of reputation and trust based on personal relations and on being known in today's relatively anonymous society with its global markets is compensated these days by government regulations (customer protection etc.). Blockchain technology would allow to write the customer protection and the ""regulation"" into the open source software that defines the business rules that can not be changed by any one party. Further any change to the self enforced ""terms of conditions"" would be public. Example: Collateral rules for blockchain based derivatives.

3b) Bringing back trust and reputation to otherwise anonymous individuals: Blockchain technology would allow an unforgeable reputation system that creates ""local liability"" on a global scale. Unforgeable rep. system means: No identities with an arbitrarily high repuation can be created and no identities can be destroyed by  a system administrator that does not exist with decentralized databases. 
What other problems with rep. systems can blockchain technology solve?

Smart contracts should be very helpful in the sense described under 3a and 3b. In what other sense would ""smart contracts"" have political implications? 

I find 3) the most interesting part and might focus on that.

If you have any scientific literature you think I should read let me know! If you know someone that would like to collaborate let me know. 

I find libertarian theory and austrian economics very valuable in that they widen the narrow view of many mainstream theories about the existence of the state and it's relation to the economy. I am also critical of libertarian and austrian theory and think it has a few blind spots. But I think blockchain technology could help to relativise them substantially. The potential implications of this can not be underestimated. It is a challenge thought to make them understood.
Therefore I would attempt to embed the use cases of blockchain technology described above in the discourse about political theory and the state and help to mediate between social sciences and computer sciences. 

EDIT: I am sad to say that I won't be able to write the paper. At least not to the extent I wished. The professor refused it because it is not his ""field of expertise"". What a surprise :) 

But I will at least, at some point make it into a longer blog post (consensus-analytics.com). Can't say when though since the thesis has to be written anyway (on another topic).

The Future of Serpent,"I have been quietly spending a small part of my time the last month continuing to update Serpent, both adding optimizations (one that I pushed today removes a bunch of unnecessary with statements and increases code compactness by perhaps 10-20%) and also fixing bugs brought in by Joseph Chow (currently working on [btcrelay](https://github.com/ethers/dapp-bin/blob/btcrelay/btcrelay) for us) and the wonderful [Augur](http://augur.net) team while expanding the [test suite](https://github.com/ethereum/pyethereum/blob/develop/tests/test_contracts.py) in the pyethereum folder. With Solidity continuing to be developed and in the long term incorporating rather impressive formal-proofing features, I have been thinking about what the future of Serpent is going to be.

So far, the value proposition of Serpent as I see it is:

1. Python-like syntax (I like it much more than C++-style personally, and it seems quite a few others do)
2. Turing-complete macros, incl operator overloading plus a ghetto ""type system""
3. Ability to dig deep into the low-level for optimization purposes (can access opcodes directly) but at the same time having high-level features like ABI support.

So basically, it's midway between Solidity and a really souped-up LLL with nicer syntax. You can even write in a subset of Serpent that maps directly to LLL.

I personally will not have time to continue Serpent development at anything more than the current glacial pace, and so I would like the community's input on (i) what direction you would like to see it go, and what if anything it still needs, and (ii) who if anyone else would like to help. If needed, the current c++ codebase can be scrapped and replaced entirely; perhaps writing it in python as it was originally might make it much easier to contribute to.",29.0,2015-03-04 19:25:37,0.87
Ethereum's mining algorithm (again),"In his latest blog post, [Gavin writes](https://blog.ethereum.org/2015/03/02/gavs-ethereum-d%CE%BEv-update-v/):

> one of the major things that needed sorting for the next release is the proof-of-work algorithm that we’ll use. [...] a swift audit of Vitalik and Matt’s initial algorithm by Tim Hughes [...] showed major flaws. With his help, they were able to work together to devise a substantially more watertight algorithm

I find this development worrying. For the nth time, the Ethereum team is changing its security model.

Is the Ethereum team seriously wanting to launch in about one month with an untested security model based on a supposedly ""substantially more watertight algorithm"", when time after time their successive proposals have been shot down in a matter of weeks?

The EtherEx Foundation,"As Ethereum moves towards the release of its genesis block, we at EtherEx are delighted to offer those wishing to utilize our open source, decentralized exchange a candid view of its organizational structure as well as our plans for its future.

First and foremost, we'd like to highlight EtherEx's commitment to being 100% open source. This is incredibly important to us moving forward and we promise EtherEx will continue to make its code available with an open source MIT license. Also, it is our hope that by being entirely open source, EtherEx will be incredibly easy to integrate and collaborate with.

Hand in hand with our open source ideology, we also promise to continue operating as a non-profit entity. Forever. It is our mandate that there shall be no business model whatsoever. This means the exchange will operate at zero profit, generating no income from its operations and smart contracts. There's only the gas costs to execute the smart contracts that make up the exchange itself - there will never be any other fees. Because of this, trades on EtherEx will be considerably cheaper (around 5000 gas to fill a trade, even less to add one) than there would be in a for profit model. We hope this, along with its open source nature, will allow EtherEx to foster the creation of a thriving ecosystem which uses the exchange as a reliable way to trade assets. 

To action on EtherEx's future, we're creating “The EtherEx Foundation”. The Foundation is being formed on the premise that any entities using EtherEx will want a voice in the continued development of the platform. Similar in many respects to the Linux Foundation, the EtherEx Foundation will be a non-profit consortium dedicated to fostering the growth of the exchange in the future.",32.0,2015-02-27 11:39:38,0.84

Progress on 'the bomb',"On [this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/2ueovz/do_you_have_any_plan_to_handle_pow_to_pos/) it was disclosed by Stephan (with clarifications from Vitalik) that the Genesis block will have a contract dubbed 'the bomb' to incentivise transition from PoW to PoS. The idea is to hyper-inflate the ether supply on PoW, thereby destroying 'PoW ether', and motivate the network to switch to a fork.

A bit of research revealed [this freshly written piece of code](https://github.com/ethereum/dapp-bin/tree/master/thebomb). Given the Genesis block is scheduled for March 2015, it may be useful for the community to understand this seemingly critical contract. I'll go ahead and ask my questions:

* Is the contract hardcoded in the genesis block of the latest POC? Is it being tested? Which team members are responsible for it?

* The following line creates ether out of thin air. Wouldn't this contract line fail because creating ether out of thin air violates the fundamental rule of conservation of ether?

> ;; Nuked - just give sender a bunch of cash and exit.
> 
> (when @@nuked { (send (caller) (exp 2 150)) (stop) })

* Assuming the contract has special minting rights to create ether out of thin air, the contract would destroy the value of PoW ether. I do not see anything specific in the code about what happens after PoW ether is destroyed. Is the idea to allow the community to destroy PoW ether for any reason whatsoever, not necessarily to move to a PoS fork?

Forgive me if this question has been asked, but how do we know that there won't be custom designed chips that are focused on mining Ether? Litecoin was supposed to have hashing algorithms designed so that only regular computers can mine for Litecoin, but after 1-2 years, Scrypt-based ASICs entered the market and eventually, Litecoin had the same problems Bitcoin has in mining (which is that more miners use custom mining rigs than regular computers).

1. The Mining software should be **user friendly**. More users/nodes get part of it, healthier the system will be. Please avoid the terminal console as much.
2. **P2P pools** should be available from genesis. As Ethereum contracts? (I remember when Protoshares was up, just one dirty pool was supporting all network).
3. Ethereum is CPU mining. A bunch of bots could hurt the reputation of the network at the start. Is there any kind of ""reCAPTCHA"" to obfuscate **bots** to replicate them? Any protocol to avoid botnets?
4. Mining from the main wallet will be awesome. If you can point to an agnostic p2pool better.
5. **Accessibility**: It should support Linux, Mac and Window versions.
6. Mining with the Browser? Plugins for Chrome or Firefox?

Don´t worry if finally we should wait to April or May, Please be sure of the **implementation**.

Alpha Layer is online! (on Ropsten Testnet),"Alpha Layer is an open contract centralizing and exposing custom public metadata associated to wallets/contract/tokens. 
 
It is the first step towards a serie of ownerless aid-contracts meant to simplify the interaction between dapps, the accessibility of the ethereum platform data, and the AUGMENTATION of any kind of [real or physical] entity we can refer to via string/uint/address types.

Accordint to Alpha Layer functionality, if you control a wallet/contract you can control its relative informations on the Alpha Layer.
The implications are many.

I previously introduced the concept in this post, but more should be said:

https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/5kq4uw/the_war_of_dapps_has_begun/

SETTING data for one of your dapps
You contract is expected to contain a (pretty standard variable) address public owner; 
the owner of a contract/token can control its relative informations on the Alpha Layer

CREATION OF NEW LAYERS:
At the moment I own the keys of the contract on testnet and I am the only one able to add a new Layer (Just contact me and I add one for you)
A second entity able to create layers is the Controller contract.
The creator of the layer (your wallet or dapp) will be visible associated to the layer

CONTROLLER CONTRACT
(under construction, should be discussed by the community)
IT should contain some antispma filter, like asking for eth (to be burnt) in order to add a new layer.
Once ownership will be transferred to Controller contract, no one will have the keys anymore.

EXPOSING A LAYER
All layers are visible, some are indexed.
You may choose layer 12412374635632, and people should scan all layers up to 12412374635632 in order to find it.
Unless you expose it.
You shouldn't expose spam layers.

DEVELOPERS ETHiquette (a good building practice) SCENARIO:
Your customers are noobs, first time they see your dapp.
Your dapp is a cool space where anyone can expose for free his commercial banner (cool!)

OPTION 1
You can do everything inside your dapp and push the customer to add the banner on the right public layer via your interface (there is a layer named ""Banner728*90 (Leaderboard)"", if you need a different standard just create a new public layer for all!).
Customers are suspicious, they will have to check the code, they will see it is ok, assuming they want to check.

OR

OPTION 2
You create a button on your dapp ""UPLOAD BANNER ADDRESS""
You push directly your customer to Alpha Layer Control Panel (it is just a control panel finally) at str-layer 50 (the location of the public banner layer)
something like this: 
http://etherscape.io/alphalayer.html?str=50&w=YOUR-CUSTOMER-WALLET-ADDRESS

example:
http://etherscape.io/alphalayer.html?str=50w=0x4ac5ed4b31f4f0e16bd96bf2d9f96200d7c266af

In this second option the customer recognizes the control panel:

1) he feels more comfortable, since he recognizes the interface

2) he now really knows what he is doing without checking any NEW DAPP code (your dapp code)

3) he thinks your are transparent

4) he thinks you don't want to collect his informations for yourself

5) he knows he is spending gas, but the location target is HIS location and not YOURS

6) he now thinks that soon or later other dapps will pull his banner from the public layer when he shows up and needs interaction, so he can forsee a growing value for that gas spent interacting with your dapp

So what happens next?
Nothing, he uploads the banner url, and since Alpha Layer is just a ""Control Panel"" there is nothing more to do, he closes the page and goes back to your wonderfull dapp, like opening the Control Panel in Windows and then going back to your application.

Alpha Layer is very simple, limited, and very efficent.
Beta Layer will offer extensive group functionalities.

PLEASE NOTE
Alpha Layer isn't a PROJECT with a future strategy
There won't be any ICO
Once deployed it is a complete machine with no need of anything else.
(Actually I can imagine it growing full, and people going to offer any kind of interfaces and little web3 widgets to be embedded in any dapps)
Alpha Layer is just a contract.


Alpha Layer doesn't born to manage identities.
More like an augmentation system.
I mint custom tokens and they can't contain too many informations, so I had to AUGMENT the tokens, and later I simply decided to use the same logic for all the people inside the network and their wallets (having already the code).
Wait the next layers and everything will appear more clear.
Do not upload private data (yours or belonging to third parties) on the Alpha Layer.

etherscape.io aims to become a minting-service/browser/exchange-platform/social-network
At the beginning of all Alpha Layer was the DB (part of it, along with Beta Layer) of etherscape.io

Due to the importance of having a really public global container, I kicked the code out of etherscape, and I transformed it into a standalone contract anyone can use without dealing with my project: Alpha Layer

etherscape will base its community and datas on the Alpha Layer, so anything I will collect will become my heritage for the community.
Once my projects will be dead with me, all your datas will be still there with you. (same should be for your dapp and your customers data)

More to come. (any help to debug and add some features?)

        uint256 taxCollected = _value * taxRate / 1000;


Sends the collected tax to `swarmRedistribution(_to, taxCollected)`, computes a `swarmTree` with all nodes connected to `_to` via **dividend pathways**, all nodes connected to those nodes, and so on, using [`iterateThroughSwarm()`](https://gist.github.com/anonymous/a3e0f84e1b3c0e06ae11b6e7f64cc227), then gives a share of the tax to every human in that swarm tree.

Then decays the dividend pathway,

        bool human = isHuman[node];

        if(human) balanceOf[swarmTree[i].node] += share;
          
        if(dividendPathways[parent][index].amount - _taxCollected > 0) {
          dividendPathways[parent][index].amount -= _taxCollected; 
        }
        else removeDividendPathway(parent, index);

The iteration uses a lot of computation. I can't see what parts of it could be moved off chain, since the `swarmTree` is used to move capital, and needs to be secured by consensus. 

Ideas ?

"Malignant and Illegitimate ""Ethereum Classic"" is spreading lies and propaganda in China to further their speculative attack on Ethereum.","Original Link:  https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/y9qfiPGy-LupKHzCQaiLWA

The ""Ethereum Classic"" community is literally spreading lies and sophistry to try to persuade unknowing and new communities to cryptocurrency that they are the noble and true Ethereum.

Lies that they are spreading overtly or by omission:

- Ethereum is centralized
- Vitalik is dangerous
- ""Ethereum Classic"" is the original Ethereum.
- The Ethereum community had no choice or decision in the DAO fork.
- The DAO hack was not a big deal and was not viewed as a existential threat at the time.  (revisionist history)
- The Ethereum blockchain is no different than a centralized database because transactions are just rolled back willy nilly.
- ""Ethereum Classic"" follows the law of code, not the law of man.  If you believe the ""rule of law"" then you must select ETC.   (These idiots do not understand the law of blockchains which are decentralized communities of humans.)
- ""Ethereum Classic"" has control over the hearts, minds and behavior of all their community members to prevent any disagreement.
- Ethereum supply growth is unlimited.
- ""Ethereum Classic"" follows Austrian economics while Ethereum does not.
- Proof of Stake is an ""insult"" to the mining community
- Charles Hoskinson is Ethereum's former CEO.
- ETC value will be more that ETH.

The lack of integrity displayed by ""Ethereum Classic"" through their use of lies, false ideas, sophistry, revisionist history and outright and ongoing imposter propaganda against new members of the crypto space for the purpose of delegitimizing Ethereum can not be tolerated.

I sincerely hope the Chinese people are not so stupid as to believe all of this.  However without a strong truth and information campaign from Ethereum then how will those that are new to the space understand what is going on?  

This community is literally being attacked.  Ethereum's reputation is being unfairly maligned and intentionally misrepresented to new communities on a daily basis.  Can this just be left unchecked?

My questions are 

1. What is the Ethereum community doing about this?  
2. What is the Ethereum Foundation doing about this?
3. Why is ""Ethereum Classic"" still allowed to use our name ""Ethereum""?   Would the Bitcoin community stand by if Zcash had named their currency ""Bitcoin Extra"" ?  I don't think so.


EDIT  Reputable people are saying ""Charles Hoskinson is Ethereum's former CEO"" is actually true, so I guess it is.  But here is another lie ETC is telling: ""Charles Hoskinson was asked to leave BitShares, then he was asked to leave Ethereum, then he went on to join a fake decentralized platform Lisk, then he left Lisk to narcissistically betray the the extremely good-willed Ethereum community and support those who propagate lies and false histories about it.""

"If you are an Eth dev called upon to speak in public, this vocal tip is probably for you","With the greatest respect for everyone's efforts, and not trying to bust balls or hurt any feelings here: there is a vocal tendency I've noticed that has become nearly universal in Etherland. It's an epidemic of ""upspeak"". It often makes otherwise excellent content extremely irritating to sit through, or at least much less engaging than it could be. Public speaking is not a small part of taking this technology out to the world so I want to bring attention to it for a moment.

If you are unfamiliar with the term ""upspeak"", it refers to the habit of using a rising pitch inflection at the ends of declarative sentences, making them sound more like questions (classic example being 'valley-girl' speech). And in fact not only at the ends of sentences, but worse, multiple times during the same sentence. This becomes especially mind-numbing due to the fact that these upturns in pitch usually land on the same target-pitch, over and over. After 5 minutes the listener wants to shoot him/herself in the head, often without even knowing quite why.

Three examples of rampant, virtually non-stop upspeak:

Joseph Lubin: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6bGuKN3m6E

Alex Leverington: https://soundcloud.com/tokenmarket/golem-network

Vitalik Buterin: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDGq4aeevgY

The upspeak pattern tends to convey a lower impression of certainty, combined with kind of neediness on the part of the speaker to receive validation for each declarative instance before proceeding to the next one. As if asking permission? Like, to tell you about Ethereum? And all the powerful things it can be used for? (you get the point).

Some of this is generational, it's more common among younger people. Another factor may be the complexity of the concepts being presented, where the speaker is often in a position where he/she is not sure the audience can follow everything well. And Vitalik talks that way lol, so people imitate. 

Whatever the causes, it would make for more effective presentations to minimize upspeak. Here's a quick vid from a vocal coach that some may find helpful (chosen at random, there are many others on the same topic):

Thinking about PoS as a Monetary System,"The process of staking coins to earn a reward is analogous to purchasing short term government bonds to earn interest.  Here are some observations on the functioning of government bond markets that might be useful to consider during the development of Casper.

1)      Risk Free:  Investors in government bonds do not expect to take losses.  Casper makes similar representations – if you don’t try to cheat, you won’t lose your stake.  Just as there are standard types of government bonds, will there be standard types of staking contracts that any layman can park their ether in and not worry about unintentional loss?  The Mauve paper gives some reassurances here, but it’s difficult to understand how lost stakes would be handled due to bugs in a sanctioned staking contract. 

2)      Market Clearing Rate:  In a traditional monetary system, short term government bonds represent the most crucial price signal there is – the risk free rate.  This is the pure price of money before other risk premiums are stacked on top – duration risk, liquidity risk, credit risk, equity risk etc.  This price of money, or interest rate, is traditionally set by the aggregate supply/demand from all the lenders and borrowers in the monetary system.  Modern day Central Banks have ruined this concept of a market determined price of money.  Casper has an opportunity to build a system immune to such centralized manipulation.  How will staking rewards fluctuate with changing a supply of stakers?  What is the effect on staking rewards if every ether wants to stake vs only 1% of ether wanting to participate?

Interest rate history shows us that cash has typically found equilibrium at low single digit interest rates, with occasional spikes following excesses of credit creation (the Hong Kong Interbank Offer Rate pricing at 15% last night is a timely example).  Are these historic interest rate ranges applicable to an Ethereum monetary system?  How might these ranges influence the boundaries for minimum/maximum rates of staking rewards?  

[History of Interest Rates](http://www.businessinsider.com/chart-5000-years-of-interest-rates-2015-9)

3)      Repurchase Agreements:  Modern monetary systems use capital markets to form new pools for capital investment.  Equity capital formation is already taking place on Ethereum in the form of the ICO market.  Debt capital formation will logically follow and staking will mark the beginning.  Repurchase agreements (repos) are a fundamental component of debt capital formation in developed economies and are crucial to the liquid functioning of money markets.  This arcane market is over $2T in the United States and its functionality will likely be built into whichever crypto community develops a monetary system around their tokens.  For example, let’s say you stake some ether for a 4 month term at a 4% interest rate.  After 3 months you find yourself in a liquidity emergency and need access to your funds.  The staking contract cannot offer you liquidity for another month…so the repo market becomes your source of liquidity.  A repo-counterparty bids on your remaining 1 month staking term and a market is made when you accept the offer.  At that point the price of 1 month, risk-free liquidity might be 2%, 4% or 10%, but the market is left to figure it out for itself.  The Mauve paper suggests that the return address for staking contracts can be an intermediary account with its own logic.  Are there any security risks created by building repurchase agreements into the staking process?

TL;DR – A switch from PoW to PoS is more than just an upgrade to the network’s energy efficiency.  PoS will create a risk-free rate of return for cash investments, which is the foundation of a modern monetary system.  Choosing a mechanism for setting this price of money should be approached with the market clearing forces of supply/demand at the forefront of consideration.

How Ethereum will eventually become the internet economy,"### Ethereum will, inevitably, eventually become the internet money

Hello again. I've for long believed Bitcoin is the root of a disruptive, trustless internet economic system, but nights of thoughts taught me the truth isn't that. How can it be trustless if I can't buy a good online without *trusting* the other party will deliver it? It is logically obvious that, in order to make a truly trustless purchase, one must be capable of locking his payment until the other party has *proven* he delivered the due goods. This is the simplest form of trustless purchase, yet Bitcoin fails do that.

If you're not convinced, just look at the infrastructure being built around Bitcoin: from exchanges to mixers and gambling, everything is a centralized service built on top of a falsely decentralized currency. That is why Bitcoin exchanges get hacked all the time, dice sites run with people's money, and Bitcoin companies are essentially becoming banks with equally abusive fees. This obviously does not satisfy those greedy for a trustless economy. I predict that, over the next years, Ethereum will slowly grow as it builds the trustless infrastructure that can't be built on Bitcoin. Eventually and inevitably, it will become the main blockchain, and Ether will be the de-facto internet currency. Bitcoin will probably still be highly valuable due to its internet-gold nature and historical interest, but Ether will overgrow it.

### We're doing dapps the wrong way

In order to become the internet economy, a lot of infrastructure must be built. While the protocol and clients development is currently exceptional, I believe the dapp-development community have been failing in many aspects, and that is the core factor hindering Etheruem's growth. In order to understand what is wrong, let's separate dapps in 4 categories:

A. Those which can be 100% encoded as contracts and require no form of trust. I call those **pure dapps**. Examples would be dices, prediction markets, colored coins, nameservers and so on. Pure applications must be of public-domain, must have no concept of ""creator"" or ""stakeholders"", must have no company behind them and, consequently, must have no operational fees other than gas costs.

B. Applications that can be partly done with contracts, but require some kind of external resource that is cryptographically certified to be trustable. I call those **pseudopure dapps**. Examples would be state-channel-based games, compute markets based on proofs of computation, real-world oracles based on trust networks. Semipure applications can have operational fees when they're absolutely required to reward the external information providers.

C. Applications that can be partly done with contracts, but depend too much on real-world resources to be trustless, and end up relying in a trusted company. I call those **impure dapps**. Impure applications can do whatever they want fee-wise. Examples are Akasha, Slock.it, Digix and single-source real-world oracles.

D. Applications that fail to fit in one of the other categories. I call those **defective dapps**. Examples would be a pure applications that sends fees to a single ""creator"", or an impure applications that could be programmed as a pure application.

Under that point of view, it becomes obvious what is wrong: *most dapps under development are either impure, due to relying on centralized trust, or defective, due to the abuse of ICOs and operational fees.*

**Pure dapps** are the best use case for Ethereum and we must focus on them. There are tons of cool things that can be written as pure dapps. They don't generate profit, but they reward all Ether token holders directly by both aggregating value to the network and providing useful services.

**Pseudopure dapps** are also great and often the most interesting ones, but are much harder to implement; we must focus on them only when the provided value out-weights the complexity. They also don't generate profit, but they aggregate value to the network, and generate work.

**Impure** dapps are not the best use case for Ethereum. Some clever companies can build great products on top of the blockchain - Digix, for example - but those must not be our priority as a community as they're not ""actually"" dapps.

**Defective dapps** should be avoided. 

But if pure-dapps and pseudopure-dapps can't generate profit, why would people build them? If ICOs shouldn't be the norm, then we obviously need to rethink the dapp-development model.

### This is what we absolutely must do right now

There are many urgent core dapps that must be done under that philosophy, and some less-urgent dapps that would be cool to have. Eventually I'll mention many of those. For now, let's focus on the most important of them: **a huge development incentive platform**. Since the DAO fiasco, we have nothing to attract new developers. Currently, most of the dapp development work is done by random people that have a profound faith in Ethereum and want it to succeed. That is a terrible scenario, and is the single most important factor hindering Ethereum's growth. People won't come and work for faith, people will come and work for money. If we want the Dapp Store to succeed like the App Store did, then we need it to be as attractive, for developers, as the App Store was. I suggest the following dapp: 

1. Anyone can propose an improvement for the ecosystem;

2. A proposal consists of a well specified task in a human-readable format; example: ""build a mobile gambling dapp: (...details...)"", ""make Ethereum appear positively on /r/all: (...details...)"", ""fix the Mist button: (...details...)"";

3. People vote on proposals by locking money on them;

4. Anyone can complete a proposal and, once he does, he submits a withdrawal request;

5. Impartial judges evaluate if the task was completed correctly and unlock the money to that person.

This is very different from The DAO model, as the roles are reversed. Under The DAO model, developers and/or companies propose improvements and ask money under a promise of completing them. Here, the community proposes the improvements and offers money for whoever actually completes them. This approach has more in common to freelancing sites, but it is much more attractive to freelancers because:

1. Proposals must, by design, be completely well-defined, to details, from the start. This is one of the main complaints about freelancing sites;

2. Freelancers don't have to deal with clients directly. Most freelancers hate that part of their job;

3. Freelancers can be reasonably sure they will receive the money as long as they do a good job.

Of course, there are many details to be worked: can someone withdrawal money from a proposal? How to decide when a task was done without room for attacks? Would it be a single contract storing all the money? What if two people complete the same task simultaneously? But hopefully such platform will be developed, and grow into a bank of tasks that will be very attractive for creative minds all around the world. Once that is done, Ethereum will be ready to start its next wave of growth. For now, I need feedback.

The War of Dapps Has Begun,"Please read carefully this post, it may change your way of thinking, and talks about a possibly IMPORTANT PUBLIC CONTRACT you should know about.

The big value of web3 is to be decentralized.
Not only that actually, since decentralization has implications, and those implications determine specific properties.
Those properties are the point.

Very shortly:

Thanks to ethereum simplicity we can really connect all our dapps together
Of course we have the same problems we had on web2: you must know other contracts, you must find their API, the instructions must be understandable, you must study a bit and at that point you can exploit it.
In web2 at some point they understood the difficulty of this process, and they started building platforms used to collect different API and standardize them in a way that you can really wake up one day, study a unique central API, and have access to hundreds sources (because that main API collects all others API somehow).
A famous example is mashery.com introduced as: ""Mashery is the difference between having an API and having an API ecosystem.""

I know what you think: Ethereum is an IMPLICIT mashery! Contracts are pretty standard, accessing a remote contract function is (almost) as easy as accessing a function in your same local contract.

Yes, you are PARTIALLY right.
My point is that we first had to build web2 and reach it limits, and then we built mashery.
And now, after all, we learnt the lesson, and decentralized web can allow us to do what web2 didn't really allow: my idea of web3.

Scenario:

You visit a dapp with your wallet, then you go away.
You come back the day after with the same wallet, the dapp recognizes you.
After a while you get used to my dapp and you decide to upload an avatar-image and to set a nickname.
When you come back the dapp can recognize your wallet and can say hallo! and show your image in your account.

Now you discover other dapps, and you will have to upload again your nickname and your avatar image.

1000 dapps and you spend tons of gas, just to set your nickname again and again.

Now the point: can we really expect all new dapps to know the other dapps api and find out your name when you show up in a new dapp? in an interconnected world this is possible, of course all dapps should be really connected to all dapps, and in that situation, assuming all APIs are connected to all APIs, you upload your image only once, and you set your nickname only once, and later other dapps will find that dapp and discover your name.

It looks pretty impossible. We can't connect all dapps to all dapps, UNLESS... we have a central contract for public informations.
I call this central contract ALPHA LAYER.
If you control a wallet, you control its relative informations on the Alpha Layer.
Same thing if you control a dapp or a token basically.
For each address there is a container on the Alpha Layer. A multilayer container actually.

Alpha Layer is very simple.
When you offer your customer to upload a nickname, you simply push him to the relative Alpha Layer location (the sublayer for nicknames), he updates his nickname, and there you go. His name is updated everywhere.
Alpha Layer isn't a proprietary contract. It is a contract belonging to no one.
An open table where developers can add new sublayers needed at a public level.
There is an antispam procedure we can discuss, when a developer wants to add a new KEY to the db table, he must burn a little amount of eth, once in a lifetime.
Some KEYS of the Alpha Layer

Name

email

avatar image

web link

github account

gitter chat room id

twitter account

facebook account

etc. etc.


If you run a business you will do everything to let your customers find you.
This is why I expect the Alpha Layer to be filled of real commercial informations, not only people adding stupid avatars and stupid nicknames.


The WAR OF THE DAPPS HAS BEGUN.
Meanwhile, in 24h a first version of the Alpha Layer will be online available for testing.
When all the dapps will push/pull the basic needed public datas to/from the Alpha Layer, we will talk about Ethereum more like a UNIQUE SEAMLESS MULTIDAPP.
As opposed to the old-school WAR OF THE DAPPS.
Stop the war. Join the ""Open Family"". Say hallo to Alpha Layer!

There's more than the Alpha Layer, also the Beta one, and more...
Can you imagine an internet without a central domain name system? it wouldn't be very comfortable. This is why there are things that MUST BE CENTRALIZED.
With ethereum we can centralize functions, and avoid any authority decentralizing the ""ownership"".
Ethereum allows Alpha Layer, this is the big revolution of web3 (not the only one of course, but it is the magic property I was talking about at the beginning of this post).

Alpha Layer is under construction.
We don't have a site at the moment, just contracts!
Feel free to ask anything.

Current State of the ETH Gas price market,"So I cant guarantee that is 100% accurate - but the following appears to be true based on current block stats and personal experimentation

1. F2Pool and BW.com no longer mine only empty blocks!!!  They accept transactions with gas price > 50 gwei (maybe as low as >40 gwei).  Collectively these two miners make up ~ 33% of the blocks. Possibly they have higher uncle rates compared to Western miners that justify the higher gas prices.  (but hats off to ethfans which accepts the standard gas price and is overall a standup miner)

2. ETHpool (~7% hashpower) will mine transactions with gas price > 10 gwei.  Possibly even lower. 

So what does this mean for the average user?  

1. If you pay the standard 20 gwei gas price, you can expect that your transaction will take on average ~ 1.35 blocks to be confirmed from the time it is broadcast and queued: which translates as about 35 seconds total. 

2. If you pay 50 gwei gas price (still less than 1 cent for a standard account transfer), you can reduce this time to about 28 seconds on average.

3. If you want to go cheap (10 gwei gas price, your transaction will take about 3 minutes to confirm on average. 

Would be interested to hear if others get different results.  But there definitely appears to be a market for gas price that is following rational behavior for miners. ",88.0,2016-12-24 03:01:17,0.98
"Announcing Contingency - The Worlds First Truly Decentralised, Trustless Gambling Network","Hey /r/ethereum! I wanted to announce something we have been working on for almost a year now. It’s the world’s first entirely decentralised gambling network, that operates using Ethereum smart contracts.


Contingency will accept wagering and also playing the part of the casino (banking), using ether or any ERC20 token (Augur’s REP, Plutons etc). It's even possible for BTC wagering in the future (Through btc-relay or something similar).

**The core problem today:**

Ethereum does not handle randomness well.

The reason we don’t see any completely decentralised casino’s built on Ethereum today, is because no trustworthy way yet exists to provide a random number. If there was, it would be as easy as follows:

    // The ideal contract:
    function bet() {
        if (random_number > 0.5) {
            msg.sender.send(msg.value*2)
        }
    }

The issue is how do we generate the random_number? Attempts have been made to create numbers out of block hashes, but this results in the ability for miners to generate any outcome they like, and thus deplete the casino (and any investors) of funds.

Another attempt was to have a centralised server provide the random numbers, but now we are just trusting a third party and end up with an array of vulnerabilities.

**How does the process look in today’s Ethereum casino’s?**

As we have seen, there already exists some gambling solutions using Ethereum. The problem is all of these rely on a centralised server in one way or another. The most common way they act today is as follows:

1) Player initiates a bet by sending funds to a smart contract as well as a randomly generated seed.

2) The owner of the contract submits a randomly generated seed.

3) Based on these seeds, an outcome is determined and winnings paid if necessary.

While this is already a great step forward, as it ensures funds are kept inside an Ethereum smart contract, it is far from perfect as many vulnerabilities still remain, including:

1) The casino operator's account could be hacked or they could turn evil.

2) The casino being shut down by regulators.

**This could result in either of the following:**

a) Seeds may stop being submitted, causing the casino to halt or a loss of funds.

b) If the casino uses investor money, the casino could bet against itself and always win, draining the funds.

Thus, a true solution is needed. After a ton of brainstorming, writing code, deleting all the code, and brainstorming again, we have come to a solution.

**Betting on Contingency works like this:**

1) CTY token holders (which we call Bankers) submit ether or any ERC20 token to be wagered against to the smart contract. They also supply a hashed secret to be revealed once bet against. 
Players wager ether or any ERC20 token and supply a generated seed.

2) The smart contract selects a Banker based on their share of CTY tokens they own (more CTY tokens = the more you will be selected to resolve bets).

3) The selected Banker provides their secret and the bet is resolved. Winnings are paid if necessary.

With this method, the Ethereum blockchain is not used for any form of randomness, and any bet is completely peer-to-peer (Player to Banker).

Contingency does not handle or process any bets, ether, tokens or code itself. All bets are handled by Players and Bankers and all funds are stored in smart contracts.

If Contingency were to be shut down or the owners turned evil, the only thing that could be effected would be the contingency.tech front end webpage. All funds and betting processors could still be accessed via the Ethereum network, and any third party could set up another front end access point.

We also plan to launch the front end on Swarm, which will make the entire process 100% decentralised and invulnerable (Unless due to Ethereum or swam network bugs).

**CTY Tokens and Presale**

As you now know, when a bet is placed in Contingency, a Banker is selected and the wager is placed against them. Thus the question now exists; which banker is allowed to process the bet? As bankers have a slight house edge (1% at this point), they should profit more funds for the more bets they take in. So it is in the Banker’s best interest to process as many bets as he or she can.

The solution is CTY tokens.

When putting your funds (ether or any ERC20 token) up to be wagered against, you must prove your ownership of CTY tokens to the smart contract. The more CTY tokens that you have in your possession, the bigger your share will be and the more bets will be placed against you.

CTY tokens never have to be spent to put up your funds, you just must have them in your Ethereum account.

For example, if there exists 1 million CTY tokens and you own 10,000. Your share will be 10,000 / 1,000,000 or 1%. Thus 1% of all wagers will be placed against you.

CTY tokens will be sold during the crowd sale (date yet to be announced), and ONLY during the presale. No tokens can or ever will be created after this. After the crowd sale, tokens must be purchased from other users (For example, on an exchange).

**TL;DR:** Contingency will be the worlds first 100% decentralised gambling network where users are completely in control of all funds and bets. It solves the issue of having randomness on the blockchain and allows anyone to participate as a player or banker. (Bankers get a 1% edge on all bets). Once launched, Contingency can never be shut down.

Almost done - thanks for a great competition and ICO,"The Virtual Accelerator is coming to a close, and big thanks to all involved for a great competition. I think we can safely say we've done what we set out to do. Ethereum is now home to the world's first blockchain based Virtual Accelerator. Almost 1000 ideas were submitted and more than 40 active teams are currently battling it out for funding and to be the overall winner of the $50K top prize.

Ethereum might still be in its experimental stage and it might be early days for the Virtual Accelerator but we are proud to be the most successful working project on the Ethereum blockchain. Although looking at some of this years teams I don't think that accolade will last very long! There are some amazing projects coming out of the competition that are really going to push Ethereum forward in 2017. That's what we want, that's what we all want, and that's why we spent the last year building the platform and organising the competition.

Our focus is now on delivering a Virtual Accelerator 3.0, which should be dropping sometime around Q3 2017. We're looking at a whole load of major improvements to the platform including; more smart contract DAO/DST options for teams, further legal work on 'securities issues' around HKG and better community tools. We'll be extending the reach of the platform through media, marketing and partnerships to create a stage to show off the best and most creative projects of the Ethereum ecosystem to the world. Our goal is to push Ethereum and blockchain into the minds of developers, investors and technologists around the world. We believe in this ecosystem and want to see it flourish. 

That we are able to do this is down to the 500 or so people that have supported the platform through the [HackerGold sale!](http://sale.ether.camp). We thank you so much for your trust and belief. The sale closes along with the competition on Thursday at 2.00pm GMT. This will be the last chance to get hold of some HackerGold and support the future of the platform, there won't be any further release of the token. 

We hope you will all join us for the last day the hackathon to vote and back the teams who will be the future of Ethereum.

Iconomi - some questions for you,"I think the concept of a Crypto-Token Investment fund is definitely interesting, thumbs up for making it happen.

A couple of questions though that I would like to rise (again, as apparently they got buried in another threat [no reply]):

* Under what **regulatory framework** is your fund regulated? 
* How do you do the **index rebalancing**? Fixed weights? Momentum based?
* How/when do you **include new tokens**, what are the **criteria to remove a token**?
* You mention an entry/exit fee of 0.1 percent, which is per se reasonable. How will you demonstrate that you respect the **principle of ""best execution""** (for those not familiar with the term: it means that a fund provider must credibly demonstrate to the regulator that he has executed **any** transaction to the **best conditions available in the market at any given time**)
* How will you create transparency that you **treat all investors at arms-length**?

Swarm and Permissions,"Hi!

I'm thinking of using decentralization to supplement a web application for bandwidth performance, censorship resistance, and international micropayments.

So I'm trying to get my head fully around Swarm and IPFS and such, and I don't understand why these data delivery systems don't include authentication and permissioning, instead opting for a setup where anyone with the address can fetch the data.

Is a permissions system (based perhaps on Ethereum signatures) something that might be implemented in the future, or is there a fundamental technical issue that makes this impossible?

"""Fake News"" and Ethereum","I think the corruption and centralization of online media has reached an apex. All of the popular distribution channels (Facebook, Twitter etc) have ramped up their censorship policies the last 6-12 months and the trend seems to be continuing. Reddit has been compromised for years.

A killer app that the public and the Ethereum project NEEDS is a decentralized social media distribution channel that can emulate the content distribution of facebook/twitter/reddit but without the gatekeepers than can be corrupted to censor.

I've always thought a system similar to reddit but with reworked systems (crowdsourced randomized moderation ala Slashdot, some way to incentivise users with crypto ala Steemit) would be optimal. Reddit is ""good enough"" if you solve a couple of important weaknesses.

I would pay a small monthly subscription for web site like reddit that had small but active community and had incentives for contribution. I need a trustworthy place to receive and discuss my news. As it stands right now, Facebook, Reddit and Twitter have all lost my trust and I suspect it will only get worse as time goes on.

Distributed Facebook. (Privacy preserving friend of friend estimation),"I was replying to u/Mr_Yukon_C's video post on Ethtrader where he says he is looking forward to a decentralised Youtube, Facebook, and twitter. When I remembered a paper I read a few years ago *[BCE: 
a  Privacy-preserving  Common-friend Estimation Method for  Distributed Online Social Networks Without Cryptography](https://www.computer.org/csdl/proceedings/chinacom/2012/2698/00/06417478.pdf)* which might be useful for people building decentralised social networks on Ethereum since we already have hash based identifiers. 

> Distributed online social networks (DOSN) have emerged recently. Nevertheless, recommending friends in  the distributed social networks has not  been exploited fully. We propose BeE (Bloom Filter  based Common-Friend 
Estimation), a  scalable and privacy-preserving common-friend estimation 
scheme that estimates the  set  of  common friends without the need of  cryptography techniques. First, BeE denotes each user using the  identifiers 
created by  the  Peer-to-Peer underlay that are  robust against the  dictionary attacks. Second, BeE uses a Bloom filter to  represent a  friend list  for  scalability. Third, BeE estimates common friends of  two users using the  intersection of  Bloom filters computed by  one of  their common friends, 
which ensures the privacy of friend lists  against unknown users.  Our privacy analysis shows that BeE hides the  privacy of  each user with a  high probability. Simulations over real-world social­ network data sets confirms that BeE is  both accurate and scalable. ",24.0,2016-12-18 23:40:21,0.95
Private Chain as a contract on the public Ethereum Chain. Do we need Quorum/Corda if we have the world computer?,"Since I am a fan of ""Perfection is achieved, not when there is nothing more to add, but when there is nothing left to take away"" I had to think through how at least some of Corda's / Quorum's features could be achieved with the help of the (existing) Ethereum Public Chain only.

The idea that came to my mind (not claiming to be the first one) is that everyone could make a contract on the public blockchain to represent their private chain. In this contract, participants of the private chain can store fingerprints and order of their private transaction. The private chain could be generic in the sense that it could be anything, even two companies exchanging messages via some message oriented middleware like IBM Websphere MQ. Moreover, the consensus algorithm within this private chain could also be anything. For instance I could have a list of participants, where at a given point participant i is the miner and i+1 the validator. The miner publishes a block candidate and the validator confirms this candidate. For the next block i+1 is the miner and i+2 is the validator and so on. I would be free to choose whatever fits the requirements of my private chain.

A simple solidity contract to construct such private blockchains would look like this:

    contract PrivateChain {
     struct BLOCK {
         address miner;
         address validator;
         uint time;
         uint txListHash;
     }
 
     enum NewBlockStatus {NONE, WAIT_FOR_VALIDATION}
 
     address[] public participants;
     BLOCK[] public blocks;
 
     NewBlockStatus public status;
     BLOCK public candidate;
 
     uint public currentMiner = 0;
 
     ...
     
     function addBlockCandidate(uint txListHash) {
         assert(status == NewBlockStatus.NONE);
         assert(msg.sender == participants[currentMiner]);
     
         status = NewBlockStatus.WAIT_FOR_VALIDATION;
         candidate.miner = msg.sender;
         candidate.time = now;
         candidate.txListHash = txListHash;
     }
 
     function confirmBlock(uint expectedTxListHash) {
         assert(status == NewBlockStatus.WAIT_FOR_VALIDATION);
         assert(msg.sender == participants[(currentMiner + 1) % participants.length]);
         assert(candidate.txListHash == expectedTxListHash);
     
         candidate.validator = msg.sender;
     
         blocks.push(candidate);
     
         status = NewBlockStatus.NONE;
         currentMiner = (currentMiner + 1) % participants.length;
     }
    }

Zero-knowledge systems and cryptographically verifiable warrant canaries,"So as I'm sure everyone's aware, there is an ongoing tension between two significant forces in cryptography and modern internet services:

1. The desire to service provides to move to zero-knowledge end to end encrypted services to protect privacy and reduce liability
2. The desire of government and law enforcement agencies to 
serve legal warrants for legitimate investigations

Mass surveillance can fuck right off of course.

My background is coming from at UK perspective where the UK government has [mandated back doors](http://www.theregister.co.uk/2016/11/30/investigatory_powers_act_backdoors/) into such service providers, pushing the balance of power dangerously towards the government.

I propose a system, we'll call it 'blockchain encryption key escrow' or similar designed to please parties #1 and #2 as much as possible.

Let's say we have WhatsApp type clone for instance and it needs to be compliant with the fucking UK draconian legislation bullshit. Let's assume the user/device retains control over their master private keys, however when Alice and Bob friend each other via the WhatsApp infrastructure, a 3 part key is created:

1. A unique key signed by Bob for Alice
2. A unique key signed by Alice for Bob
3. A unique identifier signed by both parties which wraps both keys

Under this method, key #3 does not get submitted to WhatsApp, but rather initiates a publicly auditable smart contract which authorises the release of this key to WhatsApp under a given set of conditions. This key also updates a publicly available flag which says whether WhatsApp have or have not attempted to execute the contract or not. These flags could be ingested by consumer watchdog groups and individuals.

This *potentially* satisfies numerous parties:

* Inherently auditable targeted specific investigations can be performed against criminals targets
* The chilling effects of mass surveillance could be significantly mitigated
* Companies continue to have minimal liability over their content that they literally cannot read without tipping off the target, effectively limiting rare such decisions to legitimate warrants.

Constructive feedback requested!

edit - Regular key rotation such as once per day could allow the targeted investigation of a highly limited subset of messages rather than all messages, so someone targeted by an investigation knows exactly what information has been released as a part of an investigation and what has not.",50.0,2016-12-18 13:40:00,0.94
Let's talk about the projected coin supply over the coming years..,"Paging /u/vbuterin and EF guys. 

I know the mantra is ethereum is not a store of value. But Proof-of-Stake requires the underlying token to have value for the threat of lost coins to secure the network.

Value of a monetary digital token is derived through scarcity. Bitcoin halvings are proof of that.

I can see that a low rate of perpetual inflation may not be a terrible thing. But the key metric here is the word 'low'. Bitcoin had high inflation for years but investors knew it would exponentially decline. 

If ethereum is to find investors in the coming year and (I'll say it quietly.. challenge bitcoin) then it must make an economic blueprint for inflation in the next 3-5 years, especially given the ICO approach used initially (such that we are already several years into the project in terms of coins in existence). And it needs such money coming in as ICO's for the various projects in the space raised ether to fund themselves going forward. 

Currently there are ~ 1 million coins a month entering the network. 

So, some straightforward questions. 

1. What is the total projected coin supply in one, three, five and ten years?

2. What will the new rate of coin inflation be after PoS is implemented?

3. When realistically will proof of stake be implemented (ball park official figures)?

4. If the long term aim is for ethereum to be coin agnostic, what role long term does the EF expect ether to fulfil? How will the network be secured in the longer term?

5. Given ethereum is the second biggest project in the space (arguably number one in terms of development) why is this information not visible or discussed.

I have been spending my time building an open source content sharing platform called Community using the wombo-combo of IPFS and Ethereum. On the surface Community looks and feels like a Reddit clone but I promise that it is just the beginning to something much greater. I am currently looking for feedback regarding direction, improvements, and funding which I have detailed in the whitepaper [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1IW3YqxdpveDtERUvkXtVLSdQH8o17xq7eptDbHu08es/edit#heading=h.tqigz4bgjd0).

User experience is terrible and frightening,"Bitcoin user since 2013.  Mined alts and bitcoin. Have used many wallets before.  Bought ETH in the ICO.  (Sold it since then, bought some back).  

Yesterday I decided it was time to actually try out an ethereum wallet for myself.  After being confused by the choices and not quite knowing whether I had to install a command line wallet and a second wallet on top of that or what?  I decided to try to download a wallet straight from the ethereum website.  Only that took me to a long list of choices on github.  After guessing that I wanted the mist wallet (still no idea why or if this is what I need just to do basic send receive transactions), I downloaded and installed it.  Before the blockchain had finished downloading I shut it off.  Today when I came back to it... another new version is out and now I have to download that.  The previous version froze and didn't load, and now I am so frustrated with the process I'm tempted to sell all my ETH for something else.  ",60.0,2016-12-16 20:38:37,0.78

The Tapscotts Believe That Ethereum Has A Governance Problem,">Ethereum has similar governance issues, which limit its credibility for big corporate investors, but we think ethereum will get through those too.

Good article where they talk about current Internet governance at the end as well.

http://www.coindesk.com/the-tapscotts-on-blockchain-2016-and-whats-next/

Gavin Wood gave a talk recently where he noted that Tezos will have governance baked into the protocol and that polka dot will have a governance system.

We need to start formulating such a system, at least the start of a system. Foundation funds should be spent on this ASAP. Hire Backfeed. Start paying Vlad overtime. Get the tapscotts as consultants. We have a gaping governance hole in Ethereum right now. It is sinking the Bitcoin ship. It's harder to impose a governance scheme once you have grown large due to competing interests (see Bitcoin) We are still at the start and of one mind (mostly) We need to start thinking of a system, even if it gets scrapped we need to start thinking about this. Is anyone from the foundation doing that?

"Introducing bchat.org & sebb, a decentralized web forum platform","[http://bchat.org](http://bchat.org)

>What is sebb?

sebb (Small Ethereum Bulletin Board) is smart contract software that implements web forum functionality on the Ethereum network. sebb sends and stores data which is accessible on the blockchain. Our goal is to showcase the Ethereum platform and smart contract technology by providing an easy and simple to use application.

>Why the blockchain over traditional forum hosting?

A challenge that many major web forums out there have is obtaining funding to continue their operations. sebb not only offloads the technical work required to a decentralized location which does not require ongoing maintenance, but all costs incurred are paid for by the users through microtransactions. Board owners can then focus on producing board content and moderation.

>What is bchat?

bchat (block chat) is a proof-of-concept frontend implementation of sebb. We chose to implement a familiar board style which promotes discussion and is simple and easy to use.

>How do I use bchat?

Simply visit [http://bchat.org](http://bchat.org) with any web3 enabled browser. At this time the Mist browser and Metamask have been tested.

>What does the future hold?

As the Ethereum platform develops we are looking to implement ways to fully decentralize the frontend, to reduce posting cost and improve general responsiveness, and to allow decentralized image or file posting.",26.0,2016-12-13 21:55:43,0.83
Introducing New /r/Ethereum Moderators!,"The Ethereum moderation team would like to welcome the new moderators to our subreddit. We heard your feedback and decided it was time to add some trusted members of the Reddit and Ethereum community to our moderation team. Here are the new members of the moderation team (and the short bios they wrote):

/u/heliumcraft: Iuri Matias

Iuri is the developer of the [Embark Framework](https://github.com/iurimatias/embark-framework), [EtherSim](https://github.com/iurimatias/EtherSim), and other projects.
He has been following Ethereum since 2014 and focuses on making it easier to develop decentralized applications. Besides decentralization his interests include machine learning and virtual reality. He is also a moderator at r/ethtrader

/u/rzurrer

After leaving Investment banking in 2006, Ryan has spent most of the last decade building renewable energy projects and evaluating clean energy technologies in different countries (China, Brazil, Spain, Denmark, Singapore, USA, Canada). He is currently President of EólicasBR, a renewable energy company backed by the Brazilian state utility and Brazil's largest congolmorate. Ryan discovered cryptocurrencies in 2012 and has been an active investor since that time, focused primarily on the Ethereum Ecosystem since seeing Vitalik's presentation at BTCMiami in January 2014. Ryan works with Banco Original on implementing their Blockchain strategy and is an active angel investor in the space. Particular areas of interest are best practices for crowdfunds and platforms that include interesting tokenized incentivization mechanisms. In keeping with the Ethereum ecosystem's technology focus, Ryan is currently progressing through online courses in Solidity/Smart Contract Development, Machine Learning, and Game Theory and enjoys technical discussions regarding Ethereum.

/u/5chdn: Afri

Afri lives in Berlin, has two kids, and spend his nights with various Bitcoin and Ethereum related projects for almost 4 years now. He used to be an altcoin developer, but left the scene for all the hate and fears spread by speculators. Afri is currently finishing his master's degree in computer graphics. If you have any technical questions, please utilize [Ethereum StackExchange](https://ethereum.stackexchange.com/) where I am a moderator :p

/u/insomniasexx: Taylor

Taylor aka insomniasexx aka tayvano is a striking new addition to the Ethereum moderation team. She is most well known for running MyEtherWallet.com, patiently on-boarding new users, and the occasional wall o’ ranting text. She works as a front-end developer - mostly building marketing websites for various crazy clients - which gives her ample time to hang out on Reddit, [Ethereum StackExchange](https://ethereum.stackexchange.com/), and various Ethereum Slack channels. She enjoys discussing the endless possibilities for the decentralized future and helping people truly understand Ethereum, but hates price talk and when people go out of their way to be useless. As a mod, she will mostly approve posts that the over-zealous Automoderator catches and will continue to use her downvotes and words over her banhammer, only making exceptions for scams, spam, or truly gratuitous personal attacks.",119.0,2016-12-13 20:52:20,0.93
What we know about Steem/Graphene/DPOS now?,"Steem arrived on the scene to signfigant scorn from people in the blockchain world. Perhaps the catalyst was poor documentation and communications ahead of it's launch, or the wild pump/dump of it's token. Yet Steem continues to be one of the most interesting *live *experiments in the blockchain space. It is one of the few projects that can boast tens of thousands of ""mainstream"" users, a live implementation of DPOS consensus, and an application that works without micropayments, instead using inflation to reward participants.

I haven't seen much robust analysis of the technology underlying Steem (Graphene), it consensus algorithm, or it's economic modeling and I can't help but wonder if this is because those who'd have a worthy opinion are tightly focused on Ethereum and lacking the time to give it ample consideration.

What's the Utility of Ether?,"Note: Sorry for repost but I'm actually hoping for an experts answer here since I kind of Assume that I'm missing something.

I'm talking about PoS here. So I've heared that it is planned that contracts can pay for gas with any ethereum token that implements a certain interface.

If this is the case, what is ETH actually good for? It isn't even a good store of value because of ongoing inflation. I know in some models inflation will eventually tend towards zero but we cannot dismiss psychology here. People will prefer ""will be zero"" over ""will tend towards zero"" if they have the choice.

Some might argue it gets value because it's needed for steaking. But I've heared that it is maybe planned that tx fees will be burned to weaken inflation a bit. In this case people would only earn the block rewards denominated in ETH by steaking. So the only reason ETH would have value would be that you can get more ETH with it. That's circular reasoning.",31.0,2016-12-06 09:53:00,0.88
Let's talk about Ethereum transaction transparency.,"I've been working on a project called Transaction Attestation Platform (TAP), which aims to bring more transparency to Ethereum transactions for DApp users. When a user uses a DApp and is asked to sign a transaction, the current signers like Metamask, Mist, Parity, or UPort, don't give very much context into what is actually going to happen behind the scenes, and this puts the user's on chain assets and tokens at risk. TAP would enable the community to submit attestations about functions within smart contracts, and then make this data available on chain to be included in DApps and transaction signing interfaces.

I wrote about it here, and included screenshots here: [Medium Post](https://medium.com/@petkanics/lets-talk-about-ethereum-transaction-transparency-a5a0d38ec1b5#.lr0atilsk)

And the code is here: [Github](http://github.com/dob/tap).

Permanent home for the project is here: (http://tap.dappbench.com)

This is a work in progress, and we could use feedback on the following.

1. How should we provide and distribute bounties for providing attestations? Coming up with a non-gameable voting/curation/reputation scheme is a challenge.

2. What else would you like to see in attestations? We're finalizing the schema before this is ready to be used. Current fields can be seen [in this github example](https://github.com/dob/tap/blob/master/examples/attestation.json).

A brief understanding of Ethereum potential from the average non-programmer joe,"Recently I get pretty upset as I see the sentiment of people spreading FUD and claiming that with the price decline, Ethereum is now officially a failed project. More so with the history of it suffering attacks meaning that the fundamentals behind Solidity itself is flawed and hence any code done using it is sure to be insecure.

What people forget and conveniently choose to ignore is that Ethereum is in no way complete as a functioning ecosystem for business use case as of yet and is constantly improving with thousands of developers pooling in effort to create the one true World Computer.

Sure, any program or operating system (which Ethereum can be represented as) will encounter bugs and inconveniences. That's why operating systems like Windows/Apple/Linux push out patches that fix these bugs or security flaws years upon years. Does anyone remember how long it took for Windows 95 to become Windows 10 today? Anyone remember the VAST differences in using  these two Operating systems? About the Convenience we now have that used to be unthink-able of in windows 95? What about the numerous viruses that would devastate the PC back then? All these took thousands upon thousands of brilliant minds working on one single objective, to create something that no man has ever created. To fight the people who seek to take advantage of the average day to day user, to make life better for everyone. I feel that the people who are not just investors but also newlings coming into the crypto space wanting to learn more, to keep up to date about future tech, should know that the same people working on Ethereum are the people who will make your life and the lives of your future generation better. It may not just happen overnight, but as they say ""Rome was not built in a day"". Let us support development of such significance with all our might and all our heart. Not only towards the Ethereum Foundation, but to all the developers who are genuinely working towards creating DApps that make the ecosystem a better, more convenient and safe place as their works are as important as what the Ethereum Foundation is doing. They create applications which help bridge the gap between technology and the average every day user. They create convenience for the every day user that eventually they can not live without.

Price sentiments is just but ONE of the many aspects that determine the value of a technology. It is but the EASIEST aspects of valuation to manipulate. Therefore, yes though we need to pay heed to the businessmen who are dabbling in ETH, they are but still only one aspect of Ethereum's value. What is DIFFICULT to manipulate is the interest of developers who are going to be working to REFINE the ecosystem. Because with good tech, it is easy to refine, easy to create and thus overall, EFFICIENT which would save much more time and money in the long run (over the span of years) to develop. This is something that CANNOT be manipulated. The short term monetary value is easily covered by the reduction of ongoing costs. That said additionally, this leads to the third factor that is not easily manipulated. Resilience of the ecosystem and trust by its users. With a good number of developers pushing out Dapps that are good and easy to use, comes an increase in number of users. Should these dapps persist through time in maintaining a sense of stability, users will eventually learn to trust and thus is where loyalty is earnt. This takes time again. How long did it take people to trust in using Windows for banking? Up till today we still have people who are afraid of online-banking because of what they read about money being hacked from bank accounts on the newspapers! Again with time, persistence and determination, all will be achieved. When that happens, no matter what trading sentiment is attempted, it would take them a LONG time to make any significant impact thereafter. Again, let's not forget that it will be easy then to once again sway the sentiment towards our favor. Afterall, traders are fickle minded, they will snap at anything that is easier to pump or easier to dump.

Lastly, in terms of the Ethereum growth potential, I'm fairly certain that we have yet to see anything substantial being integrated into our ecosystem just because the current running Dapps are few and less advertised to the average person. However with Dapps like Status whom are planning to create an App similar to Wechat, should it be successful, we will definitely see an influx of users with its launch along with other similar applications for day to day use. Bear in mind that Wechat alone is worth well over 12B market cap and it is able to be incorporated into the Ethereum Blockchain. That would make Ethereum seem like a Google Playstore. That said, on top of that ONE Dapp, there will be countless others available just as you can find hundreds of thousands of mobile google android apps from the google play store. Also take note that Google is worth 80+ Billion dollars. That is Ethereum's business potential.

All in all, this is but a brief understanding of what an average joe would get and hopefully there will be more posts that would explain to the average persons in simple english of what to expect from Ethereum. 

Before I end this, I'd like to remind everyone to give your support to the Ethereum Foundation along with Every other developer out there hard at work making the Ethereum ecosystem a better place! Without them, the world would take a far longer time to attain convenience, security and most importantly, freedom as there are very few blockchain technologies out there that has the developer pool(large number along with talented individuals) of brain power coupled with coding potential to accomplish this dream!

Resources On Accepting And Processing Ethereum,"I've been in a stump trying to find a simple way to accept and process Ethereum payments in a PHP storefront.

Relationship between price of ether and value of Ethereum,"I am trying to understand this relationship. To have a value, a service needs to have a utility. Ethereum obviously has a utility, which is growing by the day. But what is the utility of ether? Some examples are as gas, transfer of value and store of value.

There are trends that weakens the relationship. E.g. using special tokens instead of ether to transfer value. A typical example is to look at the total transaction volume, as measured in $US. This is harder to find, unless it is limited to ether only.

There is also the idea of allowing other tokens to be used for paying for transactions (used as gas).

I am not asking the question out of a trading perspective or to argue what the current price should be. But ether need a value that is high enough to secure mining hash rates, which is my main concern.

The total hash rate should correlate with the total transaction volume. You don't do business for billion of $US on a blockchain where a 51% attack would cost only millions of $US.",22.0,2016-12-04 08:03:23,0.95
"Hello Vlad Z, can you update the Ethereum community on POS for the network?","It feels like a very long time since we got some of your amazing posts about what you are working on in Casper and your thoughts on Ethereum's future in this congested blockchain environment, in general. I'm sure you are very busy and Reddit is not the only Ethereum community...but certainly the largest.

ALSO, many this evening have seen your recent in-depth posts on Synereo and Rchain in the r/Synereo subreddit. Of course, you are not slave to the Ethereum community but some are concerned you would put together a great deal of very passionate words toward one community and not much of anything for the r/ethereum community for some months.  The phrase (i believe unfounded) 'conflict of interest' has been uttered. 

I am asking on behalf of the  community of zealous developers and investors that find all the co-mingling with different projects, whether consortiums or other blockchain 2.0ers (*great for the decentralized and blockchain 2.0 in general*), **confusing** at times. 
I think i speak for most that direct and fluid Ethereum Foundation communication has been greatly missed and has led some to unneeded skeptical thinking. I think in the infancy of the network, top-down communication with core devs is very beneficial for the community and the general consensus of minds.

Decentralization doctrine causing a mental block?,"The main advertised promise of ethereum is of decentralised autonomous applications. However I note that:

* [digix.io](https://digix.io/) it is not decentralised (gold is stored somewhere) but it is useful. 
* Individual API's which use [Ether API's](https://etherapis.io/) will not be decentralised (the servers providing web services are individually owned) but they will be useful.
* Individual sites hosted on swarm and/or merchants with ERC20 shopping cart functionality will not be decentralised (they will be fully owned by their owners).
* The [flight delay insurance](https://fdd.etherisc.com/) app resolves centrally

So there are plently of value adding applications which don't require full decentralisation. I worry that the doctrine of decentralisation is slightly missleading and is causing something of a mental block that:

* Focusses people on decentralized 'x' rather than new value propositions.
* Prevents quick market tests
* Encourages design complexity.
* Paradoxically encourages monolithic apps which try to solve everything rather than plugging into other services (since some required decentralised services may not exist yet).
* Bogs people down in the search for a trustless solution rather than leveraging other forms of trust.
* Makes people miss low hanging fruit, apologise for or abandon projects because they cannot be completely decentralised.

So my questions are:

* Are there some things we are missing because we are too focussed on the goal of fully decentralised apps?
* Does the concept of decentralisation need to be unpacked, made more nuanced, and based on an [fuller understanding](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/5g7a8a/ethereum_london_meetup_vitalik_the_notsoparanoid/) of the benefits and where they actually matter?",41.0,2016-12-03 21:10:48,0.94
Will Someone Please Tell Business Insider That We Did Not Rollback The Chain,"http://www.businessinsider.com/bitcoin-entrepreneur-charlie-shrem-gives-first-interview-out-of-prison-to-wall-and-broadcast-2016-11

Also, they make it sound like the decision to fork had no consequences and was done with the push of a button. It had definite consequences:

1) Bitcoin maximalists took it as an opportunity to attack with a troll army while the HF debate was happening

2) The HF debate ended up pissing lots of people off. 

3) We realized smart contract security and best practices were sub-par and that things needed to be done

4) ammunition for constant fudding from Bitcoin publications

5) a profit motive for Bitcoiners to prop up the deprecated chain and launch an attack on Ethereum which culminated with ETC reaching a market cap of 50% of ETH (and which were at that time exactly inversely related)

6) months of developer lost time due to uncertainty and coding for HF and other possible solutions.

7) some (very few and exaggerated as a FUD narrative) people leaving for etc

And I'm sure I missed lots of stuff.

So I don't think this is something that the Ethereum community ever wants a repeat of.

I loathe the expression everything happens for a reason, and I equally loathe the expression whatever doesn't kill you makes you stronger, but I think both apply here, bc the DAO debacle basically dictated the show at DEVcon 2. It allowed the Ethereum community to realize a massive blind spot, which was that we need NASA level testing on smart contacts, escape hatches, slow releases, and so on.

There were many consequences from the decision to HF, but I think crazy at it sounds it was a net win for the long term -- despite the relentless Fudding it has caused.

In the past couple of years I've read a number of times that the purpose of Ether is to provide gas to the EVM and not necessarily be used as a speculative value.  But I don't fully understand the reckoning of why not.

Given that Ether is the only intrinsic value coin on Ethereum, I'd like to hear some opinions of why it shouldn't be used essentially like a reserve?

ATTENTION MINERS: We recommend raising gas limit to 4 million or higher now that the hard forks have completed,"The attacks have subsided and recent hard forks have been enacted. The core developers are recommending that miners **raise the gas limit to 4 million or higher and resume accepting transactions if you have stopped**.

Below are the settings to apply if you choose to raise the gas limit to 4.3 million

#For Review: 'Intrinsically Tradable Tokens' (ITT's) are their own exchange,"#For Review: 'Intrinsically Tradable Tokens' (ITT's) are their own exchange

Introducing [**Intrinsically Tradable Tokens**](https://github.com/o0ragman0o/ITT), ERC20 compliant tokens in which you can buy and sell directly from the contract.

Ropsten [`0xa9e001bebe4b281f7229b0305f553ab3c511fef5`](https://testnet.etherscan.io/address/0xa9e001bebe4b281f7229b0305f553ab3c511fef5)

Live [`0xa15c784319fa96d3E36cFE97fbadD89Ec704A8dc`](https://etherscan.io/address/0xa15c784319fa96d3E36cFE97fbadD89Ec704A8dc)

##ITT's extend the ERC20 API with:

    buy(uint price, uint amount, bool make)
    sell(uint price, uint amount, bool make)
    cancel(uint price)
    withdraw(uint ether)

and other ancillary exchange state getters (see [Github repo](https://github.com/o0ragman0o/ITT) for full API) such as :

    etherBalanceOf(address holder)
    getBook()
    getOrdersOf(address trader)
    spread(bool side)

The intrinsic exchange functionality works on a FIFO matching maker/taker algorithm. A new order may be iteratively filled by multiple make orders on the book or if unfilled, can be put on the book itself as a make order.

ITT demo contracts have been deployed on the Ropsten  test chain on which a number of `Buy` and `Sell` orders have already been placed for you to play with.  The demo ITT and future, more functional ITT's can be can be interacted with using the front end DAPP [`ITTDesk`](https://github.com/o0ragman0o/ITTDesk).

## Use Cases
This demo ITT serves to demonstrate the exchange functionality of a basic ITT contract and does not have much intrinsic value in the token itself beyond being a purely speculative coin.

The ITT API and base contract are open source and offered to the community in order to extend or attach value adding functionality to the token side.

As is, crowd funding and token sales become as trivial by simply placing ask orders (see Self Funding below). 

Better still would be to extended ITT functionality to make a 'Payable ITT' which becomes a simple but highly versatile *pay to an unknown many* mechanism which can distribute payments according to proportional holdings. Such holdings might represent shareholders, a rewards system or perhaps be used to fund and manage a DAO's project funds.  (I do have a Payable ITT but will not likely release it until the community has confidence in the basic ITT contract)

Other value adding developments might be to couple ITT's to fiat currencies for truly low friction decentralised forex.

##Current State of Development
As deployed, the ITT Demo contract is yet to undergo extensive testing and formal verification.  It appears to work as intended (unless compiled with 0.4.5+commit.b318366e! My first launch attempt drove me crazy until that bug was announced).  The contract on both chains have been verified on etherscan.io [etherscan.io](https://testnet.etherscan.io/address/0xa9e001bebe4b281f7229b0305f553ab3c511fef5).

The ITTDesk app is very much in *alpha release*, minimalist and clunky in it's function. It is written on Meteor and attempts to use Mist styling and elements. Probably best just to clone the repo and run it up in Meteor at this stage.  It features intelligent *ask/bid/buy/sell* trade buttons to assisting in validating user inputs in the order fields.

 I am not an experienced web developer, so feed back, suggestions, criticisms are most welcome.  In particular, I've not been able to work up the filters without causing browser timeout.  

##How does it work?
The order book utilises a mapping of 'Circular Linked Lists (CLL)' from the [LibCLLi](https://github.com/o0ragman0o/LibCLLi) library to order and lookup the booked prices and iterate the FIFO's at each price.
Each FIFO in the mapping is keyed by its price and holds all the addresses of traders who have made orders at that price.  A trader can only have a single order at any particular price.  An attempt to book another order at the same price will adjust and put the order at the back of the FIFO queue.  This prevents FIFO hogging in which a trader might otherwise starve other orders by continually topping up their own.

A second trivial mapping holds the actual order amounts.  It is keyed by a SHA3 hash of the trader's address with the price of the order (and is actually what limits the trader to one price, one order).

The CLL's heads are static at mapping key '0'. To use as a FIFO, nodes are simply inserted previous to the head and removed from next to the head.  A FILO (stack) can be implemented with equal simplicity.

In the case of the price list, the links either side of the head are the `highestBid` (previous) and `lowestAsk` (next) making the head node itself the *market spread*.  The price list is artificially bound to minimum (uint 1) and maximum (uint 2**128) prices.  New price nodes are inserted relative to the head (spread) after iterating through an order search.

Looping operations in Smart Contracts can be bug prone and costly, especially with state mutations in each loop as in the ITT's matching algorithm.  For this reason, the order matching loop is dynamically limited by the gas supply from `msg.gas` and will exit with a partially filled order rather than throw it. The remainder does not get put on the book as a make order as it would cause a bid/ask collision at that price.  Because of this looping, gas cannot be estimated and it is up to the trader to consider the costs and adjust the amount of gas prior to ordering.

The matching algorithm is not without architectural efficiency however which almost halves the number to calls to STORE by virtualising (caching to memory) the taker's state variables prior to the matching loop and writing back to store once the matching and making operations exit. 

##Security and Resilience 

ITT's hold ether balances and therefore are presumed to be targeted by hacking attempts.  A number of security features and practices have therefore been programmed into the contract.

All `external` or `payable` state mutating functions are 'reentry protected' by a mutex which is set and cleared in the internal function `safeSend()`, which is called only by the public function `withdraw()`.  This practice ensures a single entry and exit.

The architecture also separates entry validation logic and parameter preparation which is kept in the external/payable functions, from state mutation logic which is kept in the internal functions.  This allows for a secure, flexible, inheritable API/interface layer from which to extend the contract while keeping the basic ITT internal functionality the same.  

In the ITT Demo, the default function is unimplemented and therefore throws if payments are sent to anything other than the `payable` `buy()` function. 

Attention must also be drawn to some rather *unconventional* use of `uint` math in the matching loop.  Elsewhere, the contract uses explicitly safe maths functions, however the nature of an exchange function requires numerous inverse and signed integer operations.  It was found that casting between `int` and `uint` became an onerous task with potentially unpredictable outcome and a design decision was made to simply treat `uint` as signed within the matching loop.  In this case `-1 == 2**256-1` and is used in multiplication to change the sign of trade amounts during matching.

In light of the signed `uint` adoption, a further mathematical constraint was placed on the maximum price and amount allowed being `2**128` which prevents any multiplication overflows. 

##Testing

Given that this contract is *Proof of Concept* deployment primarily for public review, it should be considered insecure.  It has been tested for functionality but no exhaustive testing regime or formal verification has been put against it.  It is undeniably a *big ugly contract* with complex logic and so should be viewed with suspicion.

Interacting with the Live contract is thereby at your own risk!


##Self Funding

Being the deploying owner of this Demo ITT, I am granted the full balance of tokens and have placed both ask and bid orders as examples.  Purchasing my `Ask` orders on the Live chain does transfer real ether to my balance and so I am trailing this as a channel for funding my development efforts rather than chasing bounties, competitions, donations, (a real job) or what have you.  If you buy tokens here, you could consider it as a much appreciated *donation* which you might also be able to return a speculative profit from!  It would certainly make my life easier. :)


##Who Am I?

My name is Darryl Morris AKA o0ragman0o. I'm an independent (and some what isolated) Australian Ethereum developer.  Though fairly quite, I've been following Ethereum developments since November 2014 (PoC 6) and have been small time mining since Olympic, though not now with expensive Australian electricity.  I am best known on [forum.ethereum.org](forum.ethereum.org) where I am a mod.  I've been crypto aware since 2009 when I tried bitcoin in it's infancy.  I got 71/70 marks for Griff Green's notorious 'DAO Ninja' homework though obviously needed 72 to recognise the complex of vulnerabilities in that code!

My interests are in developing **delegative democracy** technologies with which to render all politicians obsolete (particularly ones beginning with 'T').  To that end I've developed the ITT contract as a funding component of a democracy DAO framework I call 'Ethenian DAO'.

Looking for interested collaborators.

If you have code like this:

    msg.sender.send(big_price);

it looks like you will receive 100 ether from this contract, but because of the compiler bug the variable 'big_price' will end up being zero and nothing is sent out.

But it is compiled with Solidity  v0.4.5+commit.b318366e and would end up just trapping the extract 900 ETH and allowing the owner of the contract to access them via a recovery method.

So in summary: Don't rely on 'verified source code' when the compiler version used is v0.4.5+commit.b318366e . Because of the compiler bug, the contract ends up doing something else than what the source code specifies.",91.0,2016-12-01 09:28:04,0.94

Instead of having good publicity, we are getting tarnished, because there is no voice for Ethereum.   This kind of exposure is detrimental to the Ethereum ecosystem as a whole. The bitcoin Maximalist are positioning themselves as the only viable solution to the world problems and every chance they get with the news they use it quite well, even though in most cases they behave contrary to what they preach.

"Ethereum in ""third world"" countries","I think that Ethereum and Ethereum Foundation need to have a look at ""thirld world"" countries like what Dashcoin do now. 

Africa for example can be a great new open market for Ethereum specialy if they touch the simple peoples and developers. For example here in north Africa everybody knows about Bitcoin but less more who knows what is Ethereum and how to make a transaction with it or maybe how to setup an Ethereum wallet. 
Smart Contracts too is something really difficult/new even for the developers who are not familiar yet with Blockchain technology.

From my simple experience and also from a cryptocurrencies enthusiast i think that there is two problems which faces people here, north Africa, and in the ""thirld world"" in general, are: The language and the support. For example we can see a lot of english websites, PDFs, videos dealing with ethereum and very rare websites/videos/text in another language. Even for the official documentation which can be very hard to understand from the masses and even for new Blockchain and Ethereum enthusiasts.

Integer approximated trigonometry library contract,"Hey all,

Just wanted to share an [integer approximated trigonometry library](https://github.com/Sikorkaio/smartcontracts/blob/master/contracts/trigonometry.sol) I wrote. Since solidity does not have fixed point or floating point arithmetic yet this is the only way to calculate functions like `sin()` and `cos()`. I am going to be using it in calculating the [Haversine distance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haversine_formula) for the Sikorka project I presented about [in devcon2.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90ZMaX7PT3U&feature=youtu.be)

The algorithm is roughly described in the [README](https://github.com/Sikorkaio/smartcontracts#trigonometry) and is based on an algorithm shown in the C implementation of [trigint library.](http://www.dribin.org/dave/trigint/)

There is a [python script](https://github.com/Sikorkaio/smartcontracts/blob/master/scripts/generate_trigonometry.py) that lets you generate trigonometry libraries with the angle being comprised of a different number of bits. Due to the lookup table size this is now constrained to either 16 or 32.

There are tests for the trigonometry functions from which we can see that the maximum error rate depending on the number of bits is as follows:

| Bits     |    Error Rate   |
|----------|:---------------:|
| 16       |  0.001251258889 |
| 32       |  0.000004693866 |

I have not yet deployed the library on the mainnet but will definitely deploy a version on the testnet soon.

GiftOfFriendship - First Smart Contract - Would Love Feedback,"I'm an 18 year old college kid who's obsessed with Ethereum, so I decided to write a smart contract. I know writing smart contracts is a much harder process than it appears to be, so I tried to write a simple dApp that would help me learn the basics. 

The two primary goals of the smart contract are (1) to provide an incentive to one's friends to join the blockchain revolution, and (2) to make a fun way for participants to give each other gifts. 

The smart contract is a ""bet"" between two friends that the other friend will be the first one to forget the others birthday. Every time it is someone's birthday, the other friend wishes them happy birthday as well as sends a gift to the smart contract. This money is locked in the smart contract until one person forgets to wish the other person happy birthday. As soon as this occurs, the total gift amount from all previous birthdays is released from the smart contract into the person-who-didn't-receive-birthday-wishes account. 

I've never written a Solidity smart contract before, and I know there are many nuances to the language. Any/all suggestions, improvements, security issues, would be appreciated.

Everyone needs to relax! We are building something intentionally complex and with that is going to come a long path of hurdles. For one, intentional complexity provides an awesome long-term barrier to competition -- no one will be (successfully) creating a more complex protocol than Ethereum anytime soon, and that gives us a huge advantage to become the network of choice for new developers. Two, every time the technology is challenged and overcomes the problem, it provides an even greater barrier to entry for future competition. All these problems will occur to some degree on any turing-complete (or something close to it) blockchain, and the fact that Ethereum has already solved so many of them and shown its ability to adapt will be a major sticking point for this network. So when these things happen, take a deep breath and remind yourself that we're building something amazing and that it's not going to be easy -- but it will be WORTH IT.",192.0,2016-11-25 17:38:01,0.86

A state clearing FAQ,"### Why does the state need to be cleared?

During the denial of service attacks in October, the attacker exploited a protocol flaw to very cheaply create a large number of empty accounts in the ethereum state. This was done by repeatedly using the SUICIDE opcode's ether transfer functionality to ""poke"" a new account into existence, and then repeatedly calling the same contract over and over again within a single transaction until it gets deleted. This method was able to create a new account at a cost of only 90 gas, and the attacker created ~19 million empty accounts in total before the EIP 150 hard fork in October made it no longer possible to do this.

### What is an empty account?

An empty account is an account that has zero balance, nonce and code. Empty accounts are functionally equivalent to nonexistent accounts with the exception of a few gas calculations, and empty accounts can easily be turned into nonempty accounts by simply sending any amount of ether to them. Theoretically, if miners accept transactions with zero fees, even sending a transaction _from_ an empty or nonexistent account is possible. The only practical difference is that empty accounts need to be stored in the [Ethereum state tree](https://easythereentropy.wordpress.com/2014/06/04/understanding-the-ethereum-trie/), whereas nonexistent accounts do not.

### What's wrong with having 19 million empty accounts in the state tree?

1. They waste hard drive space
2. They increase sync time, especially fast sync and warp sync
3. They slow down transaction processing, as it becomes much harder to store much or all of the state in RAM and so many more disk accesses are needed.

### What are we doing to remove them?

The Spurious Dragon hard fork introduced a new protocol rule, by which (i) no new empty accounts can be created (any operation which previously would have created an empty account instead leaves the account nonexistent), and (ii) one can ""poke"" empty accounts to delete them.

In the short term, this introduces a way to remove these accounts. In the medium term, once all empty accounts are deleted, this simplifies the Ethereum protocol specification, as there is no longer a concept of account ""existence"" that implementations must keep track of; instead, whether or not an account needs to be stored in the state tree can be directly inferred from the account's balance, nonce and code.

The fork was been implemented earlier this week. Now, we need to send ~40,000 transactions to the Ethereum network with the goal of running loops that ""poke"" all of the empty accounts that the attacker created so as to remove them.

### The spam is slowing my node down. Did you have to use this method? Why not just have an in-protocol sweep that deletes every account automatically?

The reason why these transactions are slowing nodes down to the extent that they are is that every poke deletes an account, which requires ~5-10 writes to the database on disk. **Any** procedure which did the same thing over time would have had the same effect. One could imagine a procedure that simply regenerates a new state from scratch, and this may have been more efficient, but this would have been much more complex to code and test and would have had even higher risks of consensus failure.

### Is this a DoS attack that could later be used by an attacker?

No. Once all empty accounts are cleared, further pokes to accounts have no effect if they do not transfer value, and value-transferring calls are charged an additional 9000 gas so they cannot be done cheaply; at that point, it will not be possible to use this technique to create transactions that are slow to process.

### How long is this going to take?

So far, about 4 million empty accounts have already been cleared, and about 15 million remain. We expect the process to take about a week.

### Where can I watch the clearing process taking place?

The clearing contract is here: https://etherscan.io/address/0xa43ebd8939d8328f5858119a3fb65f65c864c6dd. You can watch the transactions coming in on ethstats here: https://ethstats.net/. Note that clearing may not be running 24/7; sometimes it may stop for a few minutes or hours for various technical reasons, and this is not cause for immediate concern.

### Does this affect immutability?

No. Because empty accounts are now functionally equivalent to nonexistent accounts with the exception of how they are factored into the state tree root, the account deletion process otherwise has no effect on the ""meaning"" of anything in the ethereum state. Any account that had ether before still has that ether, any account that had maker coins before still has those maker coins, and the execution rules of all contracts are exactly the same. If an account gets deleted, then sending any amount of ether to that account restores that account and the ether and other assets in that account can be spent as normal.

### What do I need to do?

Make sure your node is updated. If your computer does not have an SSD, consider taking this opportunity to check out the [geth light client](https://blog.ethereum.org/2016/11/17/whoa-geth-1-5/), as HDDs are very slow to read and write from disk. Otherwise, the effect for you will be fairly minimal.",193.0,2016-11-25 06:14:55,0.98
Price matters more than you think,"Generally the community has been handling the network split situation pretty well, of course we have people over in Bitcoin shitting on Ethereum, but they're scared of a potential competitor so it makes sense to give Ethereum a beatdown when blood is in the water.

Now before people tell me this post is meant for r/ethtrader, it's not. I am not talking about the actual price point but rather the importance of not ignoring the market cap.

--------------------

I've seen some people in the community says things like:

""Price doesn't matter!""

""The devs are making revolutionary software, ignore the price!""

""I hold, price doesn't matter right now!""

The problem with this is that as a community we need to constantly attract more people into the fold. Some of these people will one day develop DAPP's, they might develop Etherum core code or contribute to the community in some new and exciting way.

The value factor for these networks needs to be understood as a massive driver. The value of Bitcoin attracted millions of people, many who created exchanges, developed core code, built communities, etc...

If Bitcoin had no value hardly any of this would exist.

The same goes for Ethereum.

The point I am trying to make is that, yes price does matter. If Ethereum hits $1 for example, many minds will leave and most likely start something else, a competitor that doesn't have the complex history of Ethereum for example. This same thing happened with Bytecoin to Monero, it's possible.

Now I don't think that the price could crash so far, but make no mistake, if Ethereum loses it's number two spot this early on we are going to be in trouble, as the exposure we gain from being number two will be lost.

----------------------

Of course I could be wrong, but we have seen this happen before.

If we lose the number two spot three things happen:

1) Ethereum starts to lose that exposure of being the main competitor to Bitcoin.

2) Further solidifies the fact that Bitcoin has no real competitors.

3) Allows some other coin to start taking Ethereum number two spot network effects (free advertisements in the media, etc..)

---------------------

Does this community really believe that Ethereum can lose it's network effect of being number two, but still rebound?

More likely, the next number two will attract the next best minds in this space.

Protocol upgrades are critical to allow Ethereum to reach its full potential. Some instability in ETH's multiple clients around the time of a key upgrades is a small price to pay for progress,"What happened today was not a flaw in Ethereum.  The ETH chain did not go down or stop or have a black out.  The problem was with one client that had a consensus flaw based on an edge case that did not get detected in testing due to the novel nature of this most recent protocol upgrade. The other major client continued to work as expected and Ethereum network continued to function as expected based on this client. This has happened before.

The exchanges have long cautioned about the potential for some network instability around the time of a hard fork.  The value of having multiple clients is that they increase decentralization and encourage innovation.  The risk is that they can come out of consensus, particulalry at the time of protocol upgrades.  When this happens, it is detected quickly and exchanges are able to react appropriately with temporary suspension of deposits/withdraws until the problem with the affected client is fixed.  

With the exception of a loss of a small number of mining rewards for miners who continued briefly on the wrong chain, the risk of any other material impact is tiny given how quickly this was detected. 

The benefits of ETH's progress still far outweighs the risks of events like today.  Yes, we should conduct extensive testing and not move faster than needed, but we should not let fear of similar events lead to an unnecessary slowdown in progress. ",145.0,2016-11-24 17:32:17,0.86

ATTENTION MINERS: Please raise the gas limit /target gas floor to 3.3 million and resume accepting transactions,"In order to more quickly facilitate the ""debloating"" of the blockchain, **please raise the gas limit and target gas floor to 3.3 million and resume accepting transactions if you have stopped**.

--------

Simply put, the blockchain ""debloating"" is removing empty accounts from the Ethereum blockchain. [EIP 161](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/161) that makes it possible to remove a large number of empty accounts that were put in the state at very low cost as a result of earlier DoS attacks. With this EIP, ’empty’ accounts are removed from the state whenever ‘touched’ by another transaction. Removal of the empty accounts greatly reduces blockchain state size, which will provide client optimizations such as faster sync times. The actual removal process will begin after the fork by systematically performing `CALL` to the empty accounts that were created by the attacks. Increasing the gas limit will allow for more transactions that CALL empty accounts.

A blog post by /u/vbuterin describing uncle rates and transaction fees when mining can be [found here](https://blog.ethereum.org/2016/10/31/uncle-rate-transaction-fee-analysis/). It concludes that accepting transactions with a gas price of 20000000000 as suggested in this post is fairly close to optimal.

* **[Latest geth client (v1.5.2)](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/releases/latest)**
* **[Latest Parity client (v1.4.4)](https://github.com/ethcore/parity/releases/latest)**
* **[Latest ruby-ethereum client (v0.11.0)](https://github.com/cryptape/ruby-ethereum/releases/latest)**

^(Important note: **EIP 155 is backwards compatible**, so transactions generated with the “pre-Spurious-Dragon” format will still be accepted. However, to ensure you are protected against replay attacks, you will still need to use a wallet solution that implements EIP 155.
Be aware that this backwards compatibility also means that transactions created from alternative Ethereum based blockchains that have not implemented EIP 155 (such as Ethereum Classic)^( can still be replayed on the main Ethereum chain.)

EDIT:

Details:
From the look of what happened it was done via some kind of malware. All the funds were transferred from my account on Thursday early morning 2016-11-17 04:01 .

Looking at my computer's browser history, there is actually a Parity window opened up on my Chrome browser at 03:41 , exactly 20 minutes before all the funds were transferred. I was asleep at this time, so most likely done by malware.

I run Windows, recently moved over from Mist to Parity.

I had suspected some kind of malware last week because ""MyEtherWallet"" kept opening up on my browser. I'd close it, but in an hour or so it would appear again. I downloaded SUPERantispyware , and ran that. I have AVG as my anti virus.

No, I didn't. I used this password only for encrypting this wallet/ private key.

# Better ""URI"" support

You can use query strings on the Send Transaction page in order to pre-fill in information for a user. We have always supported this but it's been updated to support sendMode and tokenSymbol:

- **to=[address]**
    - default is empty
- **value=[number]**
    - default is empty
-  **sendMode=0 | 1 | 2 | 4**
    - 0: ETH (Standard Transaction)  1: Only ETH  2: Only ETC   3: We have no freaking idea   4: Tokens
    - default is 0
-  **tokenSymbol = ARC | ICN | MKR | ....**
    - default is whatever the first token in the list is if sendMode is set to 4
    - BeerCoin and Unicorn are those words, sans emoji
-  **gasLimit=[number] OR gas=[number]**
    - default is 21000 and then estimated once a value is inserted. Get in the habit of using this though as our embedded send page will not estimateGas for users.
-  **data=[hex data]**
    - default is empty

**Notes:**

- Nothing is case sensitive. 
- All fields are optional.
- Token Symbol takes priority over sendMode. So no need to include sendMode if you have a tokenSymbol
- gasLimit takes priority over gas if both are included
- Data can only be included in a standard transaction (sendMode=0). If another sendMode is specified, a warning displays for the user.

# The Hardfork

Our backend is already set up for the hard fork so we're ready to roll no matter what. The only thing we are still contemplating is how to handle EIP-155 (replay safe TX / new TX signing method). We are ready to switch transaction signing to match the EIP-155 spec. However, we are trying to decide what to do with ETC. Here are the options:

**Plan A:**

- Standard Tx will follow EIP-155

- Remove Send Only ETH

- Remove Send Only ETC from site (until they implement their version of EIP-155?)

- Tell people to use an old version of the repo (https://github.com/kvhnuke/etherwallet/releases/tag/v0.3.2.6) if they want to Send Only ETC.

**Plan B:** 

- Standard Tx will follow EIP-155

- Remove Send Only ETH

- Send Only ETC will use old syntax to send via replay safe split contract

**Plan C:**

- Leave as is and don't use new transaction EIP-155 signing (until we have more information to make a decision.) 

Plan A is preferred simply because the Send Transaction controller is already a mess and keeping the old send transaction code makes the entire thing more messy. The problem with Plan A is I really don't feel like answering a bunch of emails from people who want to use the site to Send Only ETC.

Plan C is only appealing to allow us to know if ETC is going to get on the EIP-155 train in a timely manner. If they aren't, we would go with plan A. The only thing worse than having messy code is having messy code indefinitely.


Weigh in on which plan you hate the most and tell us what to do.

# Golem Crowdfund Analysis

As some of you are aware, we could not handle the traffic during the Golem crowdfund ~10 days ago. Up until the Golem sale, our server has occasionally crashed. The instances were few and far between and never happened at such inopportune moments. The first time we recall is when the DAO Token Creation started. Server crashed, we restarted, and everything was dandy in < 5 minutes. When we were on the flight home from Devcon2, it crashed again. This time it was due to the network attacks. We restarted, everything was fine.

Since we crashed during the DAO, our setup has changed completely. Everything was re-written in node.js, our servers have grown, and we have switched from geth to Parity.

When we started receiving requests for supporting Golem and learned about the data value necessary to successfully participate in the crowdfund, we made a few changes in preparation. We increased size of our nodes, we added functionality to automatically add data when the Golem address was entered, we increased our gas *price* to 61, rather than the 21 we were using before, and we troubleshooted some issues regarding estimating gas when there is data. If you notice, some of these items are frontend items that have no affect on our node. That's because I was more worried about transactions not being mined or people forgetting to include the data. I'm not a server person. I'm a user experience person.

We expected there to be a increase in traffic, but not by this much. We went to sleep at 4:45am and my husband woke me up at 6:30am when he couldn't get a test transaction to send via his Ledger (fyi, if a TX has data you need to turn on contract data on your Ledger). When the token sale started and the balances started loading slowly, I knew there was a issue. But with contract at 50% of it's cap and the server not returning errors or giving a 503, there was nothing we could do. Restarting would have done nothing besides ensure than no transactions could go through.

The last 6 or so token sales have gone off without a hitch. We actually slept through most of them and I we received no reports upon waking of issues. The only reason we knew there was a token sale is there was a load of emails and tweets asking for adding that token as a default token. Golem was different, by a significant margin. 

### There are a few main factors that we believed contributed to the latency of our server: 

- We had combined ""Send Ether"" and ""Send Tokens"". This means that anyone wanting to send Ether also sent getBalance requests for tokens as well.
- getTransactionData is 3 calls - it returns the nonce, balance, and gas price so you can make a transaction. This call is one of the more expensive calls and occurs when you are actually generating a transaction.
- There were an insane amount of people attempting to send Ether and therefore calling getTransactionData and getBalance of ETH and Tokens in their account...all simultaneously.

We should take this time to point out that our servers didn't crash like we've seen before. Parity was fine and synced the entire time. The server didn't drop any requests. The problem was the time it took to deliver said requests. That is why some users reported pressing a button and it generating the transaction 12 seconds later. This is known as latency or lag in the backend world and happens when there are a buttload of requests in the queue. 

We should also take the time to point out that our frontend (what you see) is *completely separate* from our backend servers that run Parity. The frontend is served via github / cloudflare and never goes down for that reason. So, unlike a more traditional site, reducing the size or format of the frontend plays no role in how our servers handle requests.

### The Data

http://i.imgur.com/HQHEBSK.jpg

- **For the 7am-8am period, we had 708,490 requests.** Meaning, there were 708k requests for things like getBalance or getTransactionData.

- 700k/hour gives us an average of **200 requests per second.** However, the crowdfund lasted less than 30 minutes, means it is likely that the number of requests per second was even higher during the initial 30 minutes than the latter 30 minutes.

- There were **1264 unique visitors.** Unique visitors doesn't count the dude who has 3 or 4 tabs open or refreshes upwards of 10 times during that hour, nor does it count anyone not on the https://myetherwallet.com version of the site (e.g. local users, chrome extension users).

- It took ~700 transactions to reach the cap. So <700 people got to participate successfully. 

- It takes **0.065s to respond to a single getTransactionData call**.

- It takes **~6.57s to process 950 simultaneous getTransactionData**

- We can handle **900-950 simultaneous requests**. Once it goes above that, the server becomes unresponsive. 

At the end of the day, that is an enormous amount of people and requests and far higher than we've seen before. I fully expected to run tests and discover that we were woefully unprepared and our servers fall embarrassingly short of what they should be. They don't. Our performance is not subpar, especially considering we have spent far less relative time perfecting our servers as we have other items on MyEtherWallet. That's not to say we can't be better - I just blame myself a tiny bit less after seeing the stats.

### Changes to MyEtherWallet to prevent this from happening in the future

1. Embeddable send page specifically for token sales / crowdfunds will be implemented. This will be similar but for the send page. It will only accept URLs with query strings for sendMode or tokenSymbol and only load the ETH and/or selected token balance. It will not estimate gas. See the ""Better URI support"" section for details.

2. Lightweight mode will be turned on automatically during high-traffic times. This will remove all balances from loading upon wallet unlock, and a user will need to click in order to view their ETH or Token balance.

3. Changes to give user feedback on the status of their request, even when the server is under extreme load. Giving immediate feedback rather than giving users uninformative errors 30s after a request is sent. The fact this wasn't implemented long ago is fucking bonkers and we're sorry.

4. Further upgrades to servers and implementation of a proper load balancer to support at least 2x what we current support.

5. Setting up a ""premium"" page will act as another ""load balancer"". Transactions sent via this page will be sent via completely separate backend and only transactions with a fee paid to MyEtherWallet will be accepted. Since 99% of users don't pay, if you do you'll be part of the 1%, ensuring your transaction goes through. ;)

6. Set up / write out an easier way to run MyEtherWallet connected to custom / local node.

7. Explore decentralized server option where MyEtherWallet would connect to a list of trusted available nodes.


### Recommendations

**Our first set of recommendations are for people, like Golem, who are holding crowdfunds / token sales.**

- Do anything you can to prevent a mad rush for tokens in a limited amount of time. If MyEtherWallet had operated flawlessly, there is a good chance the sale would have been over in <5 minutes. ~700 people got in on the Golem sale via all methods of sending (mist, geth, MyEtherWallet.....). MyEtherWallet had 1200 unique visitors. This is not ideal.

- Write up clean instructions on all the different ways a user can participate in your token sale. Don't recommend any one in particular.

- Recommend your users have a contingency plan in place. Maybe MyEtherWallet goes down. Maybe Mist won't sync. Maybe your computer explodes. 

- Recommend they test far before the token sale and make sure everything goes as expected.

- Recommend your users sign a transaction *before* the token sale begins and simply broadcast it during the token sale. This also allows the user to double-check their values in a calm environment and eliminates fat finger problems that can occur when the adrenaline is pumping.

**If you are a user wanting to prepare for a sale you know will sell out fast....**

- Have a contingency plan in place. Don't rely on any one method. Maybe MyEtherWallet goes down. Maybe Mist won't sync. Maybe your computer explodes. 

- Test far before the token sale and make sure everything goes as expected.

- Sign a transaction *before* the token sale begins and simply broadcast it during the token sale.

- Attempt to run a full node. Stop saying that you're the average user who doesn't need to run a full node. You aren't. You're part of Ethereum in the early days. Your feedback on all clients is valuable and necessary as the ecosystem grows. Get yourself set up and help debug the issues you had while getting set up. Parity and geth have vastly improved in both stability and sync times. Start from scratch after this hard fork and learn something new.

- How do we expect the average non-technical user to engage with this platform?
- From a storage perspective - this chain is demanding...is everyone that uses the chain expected to have sufficient storage?
- if downloading the chain is so slow (and inefficient I mean there should be a random check of blocks and content in those blocks...why need all 2 million?)
-What is the size of each block?
-Is moving money from ETH to fiat easy?

Ethereum on Raspberry Pi update: Spurious Dragon HF ready and one new image (geth 1.5.2) with initial support for Light server and Swarm,"Hi,


First of all the good news :-), EF has released Geth 1.5.2 with initial Light client and Swarm support (this is something I was waiting for for a long time :-) ). It is a huge step forward for the Ethereum platform so I’m releasing another EthRaspbian [1] image with Geth 1.5.2  as the default client.


#EthRaspbian (Geth edition)

#EthRaspbian (Parity edition)


Changelog


- Updated to parity 1.4.4 [4] Hardfork compliant: EIP155 (replay protection), EIP161 (state clearing), and EIP170 (code size limit). Ethcore post [5]
- parity --warp is not working yet on the Pi. Ethcore is trying to optimize the memory usage. Let’s see if it’s possible to run in --warp mode with just 1GB of RAM (I hope so, this is an amazing feature) [6]
- Geth 1.5.2 included (as a debian package and as a systemd service as well. It is disabled by default on this image)

#Switching clients


As seen on last months It’s useful to have the possibility of switching clients quickly if something goes wrong with one of them (security breach, DDoS attacks…). So I’m including parity and geth in both images (changing the default one on each). Let’s say you are running the parity image, by typing:


`sudo systemctl stop parity && sudo systemctl disable parity`
`sudo systemctl enable geth && sudo systemctl start geth`


Will disable parity and start the geth daemon.


#Geth


As EF developers already stated geth 1.5 is pretty much a complete rewrite of the code after 8 months of work. This version includes new exciting features such as LES protocol support (Light clients) and a proof of concept of Swarm. It seems to run quite well on the Pi.


##Light client and Light server


Light client works great on the Pi but as the main goal of this image is to support the Ethereum network it makes more sense to run Geth in Light server mode (to support the devices connecting as Light clients). To do so type (assuming you have the Geth edition image, hence, geth enabled by default):


Note: Make sure the blockchain is fully synced (or copy a previous synced blockchain to your pi, remember to stop geth before doing this)


`sudo echo ARGS=""--lightserv 25 --lightpeers 50"" > /etc/geth/geth.conf`
`sudo systemctl restart geth`


You can check geth status by running:


`sudo systemctl status geth`


##Swarm


Swarm binary is included in the Geth package (/usr/bin/bzzd) so you can play with it. Keep in mind that you need to run geth in another network (NOT in the main one, see [7]) and that the code is highly experimental. Remember to report any issues you may encounter.




#Parity


Warp mode is not working yet on the Pi so maybe the best option for now is to wait after Spurious Dragon goes through and resync the whole blockchain from scratch. If the warp issue is finally solved I’ll update the package.


The other great feature in this version is the awesome new wallet. If you have SSH installed on your desktop, just run on a console (you need the blockchain synced on the pi):


`ssh -fN -L8080:localhost:8080 pi@your_pi_local_IP`


You can now open http://localhost:8080 on your desktop browser and play around. Remember that if you create a new Ethereum account  it WILL BE CREATED ON YOUR PI (/home/pi/.parity/keys), so be careful with this.




Last but not least, let me say a big thank you to all Ethereum devs. These months were a little hard with all the attacks and the hardforks but the response to these issues was impressive. You are the main reason we are all here so keep up the good work.


As always, your feedback is highly appreciated.

"Quote from ""Misfit Economy"": The Hacker Movement","

Quote from ""Misfit Economy"": 

The Hacker Movement

In his book Hackers, Steven levy chrnoicles the birth and development 
of the hacker movement. He starts with the first iteration of hackers: 
the group who coalesced during the early 1960s, when the Massachusetts 
Institute of Technology (MIT) acquired its frist programmable computer. 
The cohort's obsessive programming of the machines, and the relationship 
they built with the systems, gave rise to the Hacker Ethic, an informal, 
organically developed and agreed-upon manifesto that, in serveral 
iterations, still drives the hacker movement forward:

 +. Access to computers - and anything that might teach 
 you something about the way the world works - should be
 unlimited and total. 
 
 +. All information should be free. 
 
 +. Mistrust authority - promote decentralization. 
 
 +. Hackers should be judged by their hacking, 
 not bogus criteria such as degrees, age, race, or position.
 
 +. You can create art and beauty on a comuter. 
 
 +. Computers can change your life for the better.
 
 We found this ethic alive and well among the hackers...

First contract to contain swarm hash to its metadata and source,"I love it when technology finally comes together!

I just fired up the geth **light client** (I did not do a full sync beyond the attack blocks yet), it was up to date faster than I could find my correct account. Then I deployed the contract at 0x45D779c6696fdB1eECFBbaf5E3F8b4Af9861291f which was compiled with an [experimental Solidity feature](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/1386) that automatically generates a metadata file and inserts the **swarm hash** of that file into the bytecode of the contract (before the file is uploaded to swarm, that's the nice thing!).

If you take a close look, the bytecode starts with

    0x7fe886dc769ec7d83a00b8647920917cf4b932fbb8c6fd59bf6da7d18ee84d244750

"Introducing Meme Markets. Decentralized monetization of *all* memes to increase global, economic coordination.","Hey r/ethereum. 


Some background: Some of you might know me. I'm Simon de la Rouviere. I'm passionately curious about how we self-organise in the age of the web. This lead to doing a master's research on information overload and sustainable design of online communities, finishing it at the end of 2013. Like many of us, I fell down a deep rabbit hole with Bitcoin & subsequently Ethereum, and have been full-time in the crypto space since then. For much of my time I've been thinking about ways in which we economically empower people in new ways. I was lucky to find ConsenSys (through the Ethereum sub-reddit) at the end of 2014 and have been working there ever since, primarily on Ujo (my other passion, being a hobbyist musician and music lover), and tokenization. The latter, mainly to help usher in these new kinds of organisations and economies. There's a LOT of experimentation to be had, and I'm happy to have seen experiments like theDAO garner so much attention. We can already see that global token launches are very valuable and excellent use case for Ethereum's tech.


Over the years, I've been iterating on various ideas & concepts on how effectively monetize networks & interest. I've iterated and experimented with various iterations. I've had the privilege to share with many of you about these ideas: from pubs in London during devcon1, rooftops in Shanghai during devcon2 and interspersed through it all, in the back alleyways of cyberspace.


I want to introduce a culmination of an idea that I've been brewing towards: called meme markets.


## Meme Markets


Meme markets allow decentralized monetization of *ALL* memes (in the Dawkins sense of the word). One can tokenise interest in memes such as #ethereum, #simondlr, #vitalikbuterin, #harambe, #trump, #globalwarming, #football, #capetown, #USA, #twitter, #tcpip, #apple, #freemyvunk, #golem, etc without the requirement of a centralised intermediary.


By following a coded protocol in a smart contract that aims to express natural interest in a meme, it allows the tokenisation of said meme. Users dispense money (ETH) for action coupons in a meme according to a cost set by this coded/unchangeable algorithm, upon which they can then dispense the action coupons for services in the network of that meme. Action coupons for a specific meme becomes more costly as interest in that meme grows.


By having no centralised intermediary, not requiring current legal systems to provide services (such as incorporation of an organisation) & a more visible & common focal (schelling) point, it reduces the barrier to entry to coordinate economically across the internet. The hope is that will provide new forms of agency to many people: from the birth of new kinds of organisations, new communities, personal markets and even better coordination around solving some of the world’s biggest problems such as global warming.


The details of the protocol are in this Google document: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1jm300CyrrAIbXtAopNhkYGqdmMdvUjdVDKcZU9VUdoQ/edit. It's about 20 pages long and quite a read. I've tried to finish the protocol design myself over the past few weekends, but kept running into potential issues, specifically related around making it costly to block/squat a meme. Instead of trying to fix this myself, it's better to share this with the other great crypto-economic minders here. I need help and feedback on this. If you have any protocol feedback, please help here.

There's likely many potential variations that this could go from here. What this ends up looking like could be a mix of all the different interesting things that's currently being tried: from Benefactory, to theDAO (and DAOs in general), to meme markets.

## Going Forward


The smart contracts are 75% done. A basic UI for a NoticeBoard/SimpleReddit dapp on top of this will be built & finished. I'm aiming to finish this up in the month or so, upon which I will open source it, barring no significant changes to designs.


What better way to experiment with this than dogfooding meme markets for the development of meme markets themselves? I will write the first smart contracts, develop a simple UI, and using action coupons for #mememarkets, it will be dispensed for voting on a todo list for meme market development tied to github issues. Minted action coupons for #mememarkets should ideally be paid towards developers/designers working on meme markets.


## Validation


Unbeknownst to me, I found about r/memeeconomy this weekend (from the 'dank' side of memes). Seems the zeitgeist is picking up on related ideas without any connection. Weird, how this sometimes plays out. There's at least ""some"" market. ;)


## Cheers


Many people have started to independently run into this direction of tokenizing interest & attention. Thanks to Maciej Olpinski who has been key in seeing this potential. [He is busy with his direction of this new avenue](https://medium.com/userfeeds/building-google-for-the-economic-web-on-the-ethereum-blockchain-de27cb3d23b#.2qg8saj99). It's called userfeeds. Then, more recently Meher Roy have started designing more formal models for valuing attention-ised tokens. [Watch his talk at the Berlin meetup](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYp6Rz5NKrA). Then finally, thanks to all the folks at ConsenSys & who are always open-minded to rally around these crazy new ideas and willing to listen. Thanks Karl, Juan, Niran & Dan. Thanks to Peter Borah, James Young, Jarrad Hope, Niran Babalola & Meher Roy who gave early feedback/input on this document.

Proof of existence - Ethereum,"Hello all!

Proof of existence is one of the easiest use cases for blockchains and lately for example LUX introduced this system in Ethereum blockchain:

I am also interested using this proof of existence system in my own papers. I tried to Google but only found this system in top of Bitcoin: https://proofofexistence.com/

So is there any kind of similar system currently ready in top of Ethereum? I would prefer use Ethereum instead of Bitcoin-blockchain if it's possible.

Or is it possible to do this proof of existence smart contract by myself using Mist wallet? I don't have any programming experience but if someone could paste the proof of existence smart contract code and tell me where to put the digest of the file in this smart contract I might be able to do it by myself and learn little about Solidy at the same time.

I understand Mist is similar to the Ethereum wallet which I note is the only promoted on the ethereum.org website.

Just installed parity today. Wow. So much better. Had I used this instead of Mist my sentiments towards Ethereum as an end-user would not be as bad as they are now. Why is this not actively promoted on ethereum.org?

I only discovered Parity through the ethereum subreddit. This is not an instinctive thing for many first time users.

The bitcoin.org website offers a selection of multiple wallets and discusses the pro's and con's of each. What's stopping the Ethereum.org website from doing the same?

Ethereum has some bad PR issues at the minute and negative sentiment especially over the DOS attacks. 

Addressing this issue would help solve some of these problems. ",37.0,2016-11-13 21:35:22,0.83
ERC20-compliant wrapper token for GNT - will enable trading of wrapped GNT on Etherdelta,"As discussed previously here and based on some code from /u/JonnyLatte (thx!), I have just deployed a smart contract which accepts GNT tokens and issues GNTW tokens in return. GNTW are fully ERC20-compliant, so it will be possible to trade them on Etherdelta (should /u/frenchhoudini decide to list it). It lives at 0x936f78b9852d12f5cb93177c1f84fb8513d06263 . At any point GNTW can be exchanged back into GNT.

You can find the verified source code on Etherscan: https://etherscan.io/address/0x936f78b9852d12f5cb93177c1f84fb8513d06263#code

I might develop a UI for it as well, if there is interest and I'll find them time. In the meantime you can use it directly from Ethereum Wallet if you are comfortable with that. Here is how:

* Go to Contracts > Watch Token and input the token address as 0x936f78b9852d12f5cb93177c1f84fb8513d06263 - the details (name, symbol and decimal places) should automatically appear
* Go to Contracts > Watch Contract and start watching the wrapper contract. Enter GNTW as a name and 0x936f78b9852d12f5cb93177c1f84fb8513d06263 for the contract address. Then copy the JSON interface description from Etherscan - you can find it as the section ""Contract ABI"" on the source code page ( https://etherscan.io/address/0x936f78b9852d12f5cb93177c1f84fb8513d06263#code ).
* **Important**: You can not just send GNT to the wrapper contract. It won't know where the GNT came from and can't credit it. So again: do not just send GNT directly to the wrapper!
* Instead, you first need to request your personal deposit address: Go to the newly watched contract and on the right hand side you see a section 'Select function' and from the drop-down menu select 'Create Personal Deposit Address'. Click on the button 'Execute' (no need to send ether along) to invoke the function. This will cause the wrapper contract to assign you a unique deposit address.
* To find out what your deposit address is, take a look at the left column and find the section 'Get personal deposit address'. Paste here the address of your account (the one you have used to invoke the contract just now). After you paste it, the field below titled 'Deposit address' will switch to show your personal deposit address.
* You can now deposit GNT. Simply transfer GNT to your personal deposit address. Start with a small amount to test things out.
* After your transfer completes, you have to poke the wrapper contract again. From the list of functions in the right column select 'Process Deposit' and invoke it by pressing the button 'Execute'.
* You should now receive as much GNTW as you have deposited GNT.
* To turn GNTW back into GNT you only need to transfer GNTW back to the wrapper contract. So perform a simple token transfer and send GNTW to the address of the wrapper contract ( 0x936f78b9852d12f5cb93177c1f84fb8513d06263 ). It will detect the transfer and return GNT to you.

I tested the smart contract on testnet. As always though, there might be bugs that I have missed. Maybe I can ask /u/JonnyLatte and /u/frenchhoudini to take a look? It would be much appreciated! Any other feedback and comments are of course welcome as well!",44.0,2016-11-13 21:06:41,0.89
"A few clarifications on Viper, Serpent and HLLs","After yesterday's post on [Viper](http://github.com/ethereum/viper), I wanted to make a few clarifications on the language and it's role in the ethereum HLL ecosystem.

* Just to reiterate, Viper is pre-alpha. Use with extreme caution at this point.
* Viper is technically not ""total functional"", it's ""total"" or ""decidable"" (see [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decidability) for entry to the relevant rabbit hole). So it doesn't do functions without side effects. That said, I certainly could forbid permanent variable changes or outside calls that could lead to such changes in constant functions - in fact, I'll probably do that in the next release, which *will* make the language at least more functional-friendly.
* **Viper is NOT meant to be one-language-to-rule-them-all and is not meant to replace Serpent, Solidity and LLL**. Releasing Viper should NOT be taken as a statement that I believe that Viper is superior to existing languages in all situations, or that it solves problems that modifications to existing languages cannot solve. **Solidity developers are also working on overflow checking and other safety features; this is great work and I support it**. The reasoning behind starting fresh was to provide greater freedom for initial experimentation without stepping on anyone's toes, to provide different properties and tradeoffs compared to existing languages, and to increase choice. See also: [Bamboo](https://github.com/pirapira/bamboo), another experimental HLL-under-development.
* Why did I make viper instead of continuing working on Serpent? First of all, **Viper is strictly less powerful than Serpent in certain _intended_ ways, such as being decidable and thus not having dynamic-length loops**. Another example is that Viper only supports 128 bit integers, addresses, bytes32s and decimal fixed point values, whereas Serpent supports larger integers. Serpent also adds the ability to directly call the EVM, which Viper does not have. Developers working on Serpent may not be ready to accept all of these restrictions. Second, the Serpent compiler's C++ codebase honestly is hard to work with and hard for both myself and new developers to get their hands on. The choice to write the compiler in C++ was made originally because we had thought it would be directly available from inside Geth, Mist, etc; now this consideration doesn't exist and python is clearly easier to read and develop on.
* What will the future of Serpent be? This honestly depends on what the Serpent community (Augur, btcrelay, looking at you!) want it to be. I personally have little time to keep developing Serpent myself, especially given that the codebase is at least in my opinion not in a state that's very friendly to continued expansion, and so far I have not been very successful in getting outside community participation. That said, Serpent users are welcome to make their voices heard; **options include (i) keeping the language itself fairly static and doing ongoing maintenance to keep up with EVM changes (eg. EIP 86, sharding), (ii) expanding Viper and providing a pathway for all Serpent code to get (mostly) automatically converted into Viper code**, and (iii) some team taking on Serpent and pursuing a much more active and independent development path.",84.0,2016-11-13 12:17:05,0.95
Ethereum doesn't need better PR. Ethereum needs better clients/wallets,"If I want to send or receive value, any of the top Bitcoin wallets (Electrum, MultiBit HD, Bitcoin Core, Bitcoin Wallet, CoPay) provide a much more secure, private and convenient experience than existing Ethereum wallets.

The work down by Ethereum client/wallet developers is greatly appreciated, so this is not a slight against them. Without their work, Ethereum would be much further behind. This simply acknowledging where Ethereum falls short relative to other cryptocurrency offerings, and what is the biggest limiting factor in adoption. 

There's no point in doing PR if the current state of the ecosystem is not ready for non-technical users.

Is Rootstock a threat to Ethereum?,"Just some thoughts, let me know what you think.

**Does Rootstock currently pose a threat to Ethereum?**

This depends. If smart contracts start to play a bigger and bigger role in powering decentralised applications, we might find that it will be unacceptable to host a smart contract on Rootstock.

This is because Rootstock is currently a federated sidechain (read: centralised) and relies on merge mining, a poor choice for security.

If smart contracts never move past the toy phase and are only being used to handle small amounts of money, etc.. it's likely Rootstock will be competitive to Ethereum.

As I believe that smart contracts, autonomous code, etc... will become a defining feature of the next technological movement, Ethereum will be far more attractive for deployment than Rootstock.

**Is there any real threat then?**

Yes! If someone figures out a way to:

1. Have a sidechain on Bitcoin that doesn't have the merge mining requirement.
2. And is still secure, with no chance of funds being stolen, (read: doesn't require mining.)
3. And is decentralised.

Ethereum may have a real problem.

**Conclusion**

At the moment the nature of the setup for Rootstock poses Ethereum no real threat.

However, a breakthrough with sidechains most certainly could cause a problem.

**Solution**

Ethereum should starting aiming to become Bitcoin faster than Bitcoin becomes Ethereum.

I know many of you have heard that line before, what does it mean and how do we get there?

Complete these projects:

1. Sharding.
2. Raiden.
3. PoS

But most importantly, to really unleash the above 3, we need to:

*Accept that ETH is also able to be used a digital currency that can directly compete with Bitcoin.*

I understand that is very controversial, however I believe that it's acceptance is important for Ethereum.",24.0,2016-11-13 03:37:55,0.78
In Response to Recent Criticism of Ethereum Foundation and PR,"Hey all! Hope you're having an excellent weekend.

I was writing a response to [this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/5cluyl/should_the_ethereum_foundation_devote_more/) in a comment to the post, but decided to make it a poet instead since it's a bit long. The thread was super helpful. It is always good to hear feedback from the community. Here are my responses to the post and comments.

1. Our previous external relations/PR person George Hallam (/u/thehighfiveghost) has taken leave from the Ethereum Foundation to pursue education in programming/computer science. We all wish him the best.

2. I have taken over many if his tasks and it is honestly taken me some time to get used to it. There are a lot of channels of communication, as there should be with any successful organization, and I am still getting used to all of them.

3. I am not responsible for hiring, but I strongly feel that as we grow we will hire more people to solve inefficiencies and changes that naturally occur with growth.

4. I will make a personal effort to do a better job of handling social media and other communication channels. I admit that I have not done a great job of that lately, and the complications around the Devcon videos only exacerbated that. Every presenter from Devcon2 deserves a tweet and accompanying Reddit thread so people can be aware of all the awesomeness that occurred in Shanghai.

5. Community organization needs to improve. Before I was working for the foundation, I had a number of initiatives that I started that grew into experience and relationships in the Ethereum community. I encourage anyone that feels passionate about Ethereum to take on similar efforts. It's the best way to give back and you learn a lot in the process.

6. Keep me and others in the Ethereum community accountable. If I'm doing a shitty job, PM me with constructive criticism or concerns. I'd love to hear it, unless it is mean or disrespectful, in which case I will ignore you. Ain't nobody got time for that.

7. This would be a good time to remind everyone that the Ethereum Foundation funds a number of education, development, and research initiatives, but in no way is the official mouthpiece of Ethereum. This software project and community is decentralized and it should remain that way. Any announcement the Foundation makes is not an edict and there are many other groups (ether.camp, Consensys, Parity) who have thought leaders in the community who help make decisions that are passed along by the Foundation through the Ethereum blog and Ethereum social media channels.

8. This subreddit is very popular and we frequently have dozens of items in the moderstion queue daily. In order to  help us keep up with it we are in the process of adding more moderators. We will release an announcement soon about that with details.

As always I welcome feedback and thank everyone for the encouragement and concerns they have.",111.0,2016-11-13 00:18:18,0.97

PSA for everyone who cant keep full node/mist,"If running full node is big no for you (sync issues, old & slow HDD, limited disk space, limited bandwidth ect), then there is lightweight solution that allows using nearly all Ethereum Dapps including official wallet.ethereum.org

- Download Google Chrome browser
- Go to chrome web store and download MetaMask plugin
https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/metamask/nkbihfbeogaeaoehlefnkodbefgpgknn
- Set up password, write down seed phrase and keep it in some safe place
- Load metamask with some ETH

Thats it. Metamask modifies functionality of google chome, to fully resemble mist browser. You can go to wallet.ethereum.org and add it to your bookmarks, it will work just as if you accesed it with Mist.

You can also use Metamask to send and recieve funds directly - it does not however display custom tokens by itself - you need to use dapp that is able to recognize them (like wallet.ethereum.org or etherdelta.github.io)",30.0,2016-11-12 15:03:25,0.88

"Viper: a new (total functional, strongly typed, bounds/overflow-checking, fixed-point-decimal) python syntax-based HLL","The following represents a *very* rough pre-alpha, encompassing the work I have done on this over the last week. So feel free to test it out, but do not yet use this to make contracts that store any money. Gas estimation is still not reliable.

The language's syntax is python-based, and in fact unlike Serpent, which includes a parser built from scratch, Viper relies on python3's ast module directly. The goal of the language is to have a syntax fairly similar in spirit to python and serpent, but there are very substantial differences. In general the features in Viper are:

* Types. Serpent had not types, and you could even do things like `seq(x = array(5), y = array(5), z=x + y)` and get out a completely random memory location that could theoretically point to anything. Viper prevents you from doing something that silly, and only allows you to add things that are numbers, doesn't allow you to array-access things that are not arrays, etc. Types can be either inferred, or can be declared via the `x = type` syntax.
* There are five major types supported: num, decimal, address, bytes32, bool. Num are 128-bit signed numbers (this makes overflow checking easier), decimals are fixed point numbers where the integral component is 128-bit signed and the fractional component is base-10 with ten decimal places. Decimal fixed point is considered to be a very good choice in finance due to its ability to exactly store base-10 fractional values (eg. $15.2857) and is even mandated in some applications for this reason. Addresses, bytes32 and booleans are self-explanatory.
* Total functional. There are no `while` loops; the only looping construct that exists is a `for i in range(n): do_stuff` statement, where `n` MUST be a constant nonzero positive integer. This means that for _all_ valid Viper code it is possible to compute a precise upper-limit on gas consumption, resolving many classes of security issues.
* Same sorts of complex and composite data structures that you can find in Serpent
* ABI compatibility
* Bounds checking for array accesses
* Overflow and zero-division checking for arithmetic

Here is a code example:

    # Global variables
    funders = {num: [sender(address), value(num)]}
    nextFunderIndex = num
    beneficiary = address
    deadline = num
    goal = num
    refundIndex = num

    # Constructor
    def __init__(_beneficiary: address, _goal: num, _timelimit: num):
        self.beneficiary = _beneficiary
        self.deadline = block.timestamp + _timelimit
        self.goal = _goal

    # Participate in the crowdfund
    def participate():
        assert block.timestamp < self.deadline
        nfi = self.nextFunderIndex
        self.funders[nfi].sender = msg.sender
        self.funders[nfi].value = msg.value
        self.nextFunderIndex = nfi + 1

    # Is the crowdfund expired?
    def expired() -> bool(const):
        return block.timestamp >= self.deadline

    # Has the goal been reached?
    def reached() -> bool(const):
        return self.balance >= self.goal

    # Send money to beneficiary if sufficient
    def finalize():
        assert block.timestamp >= self.deadline and self.balance >= self.goal
        selfdestruct(self.beneficiary)

    # If balance insufficient, refund
    def refund():
        assert block.timestamp >= self.deadline and self.balance < self.goal
        # Refund everyone in a loop
        ind = self.refundIndex
        for i in range(30):
            if ind + i >= self.nextFunderIndex:
                self.refundIndex = self.nextFunderIndex
                return
            send(self.funders[ind + i].sender, self.funders[ind + i].value)
            self.funders[ind + i].sender = ""0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000""
            self.funders[ind + i].value = 0
        self.refundIndex = ind + 30

Compiler and tests are here: http://github.com/ethereum/viper

Note that Viper is based on **python3**. Hence, you'll need to use python3 to compile it, and compile pyethereum with python3 if you want to test it.

I don't think anyone ever said that it's going to work 100% when hundreds of people are hammering it at the same time. The key here isn't really the amount of people, it's the spike. Obviously this web wallet isn't able to handle a spike of perhaps several orders of magnitude in usage.

I really do not think it was ever designed or advertised that it could.

I've participated in a few ICO's now and one thing that I have learnt is that having a full node is vital for this type of transaction. The same thing applies everywhere, on Christmas day VISA can crash, chill out.

"NameGame: A purposefully low-stakes, easily-understandable, easily-teachable smart contract example.","I want to create a low-stakes, easily-teachable, interactive smart contract for use in a classroom situation. The focus is not on features, but on understandability and ease of explanation instead. The two primary focuses are (1) proper care of participant's ether, and (2) good 'social engineering', by which I mean trying to control each participant's behavior.

I'm not the world's most accomplished Solidity programmer (this is only my third or fourth effort), so I wondered if some more experienced Solidity experts could look this over to see if I am, indeed, taking good care of the ether.

The contract is purposefully low-stakes (no more than five participants), and I've tried to make it as simple to understand as possible (it will be used in a classroom environment). Any suggestions, improvements, security issues, would be appreciated.

Questions about the Foundation's resource allocation and planning,"I generally believe that an open source project like Ethereum is as valuable as the developer team behind it. I also remember /u/vbuterin stating that one of the most probable ways the whole endeavor could fail would be adoption outpacing development (forgive me if I remember this wrong but I am unable to locate the exact comment, feel free to correct me).

With that in mind, and this goes out to all and any developers and Foundation members:

**a) Do you believe that there is enough manpower (or brainpower) working on Ethereum?** Are there enough researchers on security/scalability topics as complicated as sharding/PoS or the refinement of tools the community will use to build functional dApps?

People sometimes answer this by saying that more money/work hours thrown on a project does not equal better results and that on a larger scale projects inevitably become more inefficient and hard to coordinate. So what makes you think that the current configuration is optimal / what are you doing to optimize it?

**b) What are you doing to prevent similar mistakes to the ones made by Bitcoin community** bringing discussions on scalability to a stalemate (be it because of actual differences in design approach or blatant conflict of interest)? Do you believe we would still be having DAO-related-fork discussions if we weren't under obvious hard-coded time pressure? Are tools like carbonvote enough to resolve future issues of political nature?

**c) Do you think that finances are handled in an adequately transparent manner and is that important to avoid corruption/backroom deals/conflict of interest?**  I have seen some informal updates in the past from time to time. What's the situation like now?

As a long time supporter, I appreciate the effort you've put in so far and really hope your vision materializes.

Solidity enums - breaking changes for anyone?,"For the next version of Solidity (in about 1-2 weeks) we plan to make some changes to the implementation of enums to make them safer. As the behaviour of enums was under-specified (sorry about that), we would like to introduce them in a non-breaking change release. I would like to get the opinion of the community if some of these cases were used by someone.

a. conversion between enum types

Explicit conversions between two enum types were possible, they are now disallowed. Reason: Conversion between enums and unsigned integers are generally accepted (though arguable), but conversions between two different enums will probably generate too much confusion about which enum value is mapped to which.

b. empty enums

An empty enum type was previously allowed, now it is disallowed (`enum X {}`). There is not much use for an empty enum type (we now have the empty tuple to better fulfill a void type) and removing it makes some implementations much easier.

c. exceptions for out of range values

If an enum receives a value that is outside its range, the new implementation generates a runtime exception (or a compile time error if detectable at compile time).

For enums, it is much harder to find a reasonable conversion for out-of-range numbers. It is more obvious for integers and anything that has a power of two as the number of its possible values. In general, we would like to throw exceptions on any overflow and since it was hard to find a suitable conversion, throwing an exception seemed like the best solution.

"""Put Your Money Where Your Contract Is"" - an automated bug bounty program for high stake contracts","[Read about it here](https://github.com/rmerom/PutYourMoneyWhereYourContractIs).

In short: We propose a way to automate bug bounties to high-stake contract before these contracts start to raise funds.
The idea is to provide a decentralized security audit by attracting white hat security experts to look at the contract code and try to break it before it is deployed, with absolute confidence they will get the bounty funds if they do.

This would also help users and investors build confidence in the said contract, knowing it has been up for grabs of a bounty of X ether for Y weeks.

Of course, this should not be seen as a silver bullet for contract security, but rather another tool in the toolkit of high-stake contract authors.

Velocity is shutting down,"Content from: http://blog.velocity.technology/velocity-is-shutting-down/

First of all, I want to start by thanking the Ethereum community and each and everyone who took time to read our whitepaper / use our demo / spend any mind time on us.  I would personally like to thank each of the team members (Daniel, Shayan, Moe, Jeff, Will) who contributed to Velocity. The past 9 months has been fun and we learned a lot working on Velocity. But, sadly velocity is coming to an end. Below I put together various reasons why we decided to pull down Velocity and lessons we learnt working on getting a DApp of the ground. 


We started working on Velocity on Feb 2016. We wanted to work on pure on-chain insurance product and ended up thinking derivatives is the correct starting point to that. We quickly started working on a white paper (http://velocity.technology/doc/velocity_whitepaper.pdf ), the starting point was just to design a traditional derivative contract on Ethereum. This worked well, but the problem we were trying to solve was changing. The difficult part was not modelling a derivatives contract on Ethereum but to build everything around it and we spent a lot of time and hit a number of roadblocks.
  
We wanted work towards getting real-time data integrated. We went on and built Pricegeth (https://github.com/VelocityMarket/pricegeth,), which would continuously post data from any feed onto the blockchain every block. This worked well with our demo (http://demo.velocity.technology/) (the code for options contract used in the demo can be found at: https://github.com/VelocityMarket/Options-Contract ). But we were still running several components on a central server. After spending quite a bit of time we concluded that real time data oracles are not plausible on Ethereum. Even if we attempt to decentralize this component, we will be prone to attacks and data will never be real time, there will be at least a delay of 10 seconds and this is a huge attack vector. The liquidity providers can get exploited, because the buyers of the derivative contract would know in advance the underlying price they are buying into. This problem cannot be solved without the platform evolving to the point where all data is native inside the Ethereum blockchain itself.


Liquidity providers


In the demo we were the counterparty in every trade. We hadn’t done much work to understand or create a model where it makes sense to be a liquidity provider. The economics of a liquidity provider and the design is necessary part of the product. Especially with the disadvantages the liquidity provider faces with respect to timing the trades, the trades always will win against the liquidity provider and it becomes an attack vector, that will force liquidity providers to flea. A clear design of the liquidity providers role, the risks one is exposed to and the potential for making money has to be designed to fix these problem.
 
Market for derivative contracts


We modelled collared options. Fully backed options, with a limits to how much both parties getting into the trade can make or lose. As far as the feedback we have received so far, when people look at an derivative they need something that looks similar to the traditional derivative. This is almost impossible to build, without having a method to do margin accounts.


I am happy to see how the community is evolving, I am very positive about the future of Ethereum, this has been a year for infrastructure. Financial derivatives are a little too early for the ecosystem.


I would once again personally thank everyone who contributed to Velocity. I will keep you updated on what’s next.

The Crowdsale Analyst: Golem - Final Thoughts,"Golem is a very interesting project for many reasons with an end goal of building a decentralized supercomputer and a software service marketplace for the next generation of the web (web 3.0, aka the decentralised web). It’s very ambitious, they have an open and inclusive approach and in the end I think they will contribute a lot back to the Ethereum community.  
  
A few weeks ago they released a [draft white paper](https://blog.golemproject.net/golem-crowdfunding-whitepaper-draft-release-f5b7b8a0cb06#.62qpvo1kq) for the upcoming ICO and asked for feedback. That's a great initiative in my opinion. No one knows (yet) the ultimate strategy and mechanics for crowdfundings that will give the right balance of information and expectations to participants as well as give the project the highest long term chance of success.  Being open to improve this process is a great step forward.  
  
The Golem team later published a [release candidate](https://blog.golemproject.net/golem-crowdfunding-whitepaper-release-candidate-c817ebd911b#.ugltkyk9p) of the white paper together with comments about the main points in my [preliminary analysis](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/57x1oh/the_crowdsale_analyst_golem_preliminary_thoughts/). Of course it makes me happy to see how they considered not only mine but also the other feedback they got during this process. Compared to the draft white paper the [final white paper](https://golem.network/doc/Golemwhitepaper.pdf) is vastly improved, it is easy to read and follow now and everyone slightly interested in Golem should read it from start to finish.  
  
What I must make very clear is that I do not believe that the community should control what the Golem team (or any other team out there) should or should not do, they should make their own strategy, decisions and plans. But, this is a diverse and inclusive community with so many talented and skilled people in various fields that I truly believe that listening to constructive feedback can improve the projects and change them in positive ways.  
  
I'm subjectively scoring each of the below categories from 0 to 5, where 3 should be neutral in the eyes of the crowdsale participant. Below 3 is bad for the investor and above 3 is good for the investor (and could be good for the project as well). At the end I'll add a conclusion where I rate the whole ICO based on the combined information I have as negative, neutral or positive.  
  
## Project: The Golem Project  
I earlier wrote that the easiest way to understand Golem is like a decentralised Amazon AWS service, well that was a bad description by me. Golem is something bigger and I see two main parts to it:  
1. A decentralised marketplace for computer resources. In the design this includes services like Amazon AWS that could sell excess capacity (or all capacity) on the Golem marketplace, together with and in direct competition with resources from other cloud services, data centers and all the way down to end users with spare capacity.  
2. A microservice platform and decentrlizaed software registry that will provide the computational resources needed for web 3.0 and other direct use cases.  
  
The current paradigm of Ethereum development (if we have one yet) is to build the complete decentralised application (smart contracts) on Ethereum and then use services like IPFS to add functionality that is not available on Ethereum. I share the future vision with Golem where Ethereum will handle only the parts needing consensus, immutability, transparency and accountability - in short the literal meaning of smart contracts. The other parts of the applications will be handled off-chain, by services such as Golem. Ethereum is not well suited for general software development (for efficiency, security and upgradability reasons). I can see how Golem could be an important piece of the puzzle that will give the smart contracts access to needed services and resources to scale out to fully decentralised platforms with possibility of almost unlimited capacity.    
  
#### Team/Founders 4/5  
**Do these guys have what it takes to succeed as entrepreneurs? Track record and previous projects? Experience and formal education?**  
  
The Golem team is already at 12 people (up from 10 since the draft white paper). This means they already have a critical mass of people and will be able to scale their operations efficiently if/when raising a lot of funds. They mention a goal of growing the team to 20 people which is absolutely doable given their current size.  
  
Since the release of the draft white paper they not only published a blog post about the founding team, but also added a very good section about them in the white paper for us that don't know the team and founders since before. What is most important is that we now know that the founders both have startup, operational and business experience from running a company, while also having a track record of delivering advanced technological solutions.    
  
The rest of the team they have gathered so far looks very competent, with great experience that already cover key parts of the technology stack and with people who's contributions are known to the Ethereum community.  
  
### Market Potential 4/5  
The cloud compute market is a multi billion market dominated by large IT companies (such as Amazon, Google, Microsoft and IBM). On the IAAS (infrastructure-as-a-service) side Golems key advantage will be the possibility to offer a completely transparent market for compute resources. Since large scale data centers will compete with excess home capacity (where the marginal cost is more or less electricity), costs should go down and that will drive adoption. The problem is the tight integration and ecosystems of the other platforms. Amazon AWS does not only provide compute, storage and transfer. They have so many services built around this to create full stacks with connected networking, DNS services, shared files systems etc. All of this will probably be possible to replicate on Golem, but it will take time and considerate effort, and the switching cost from Amazon to Golem will be high.  
  
For the SAAS (software-as-a-service) part of the service the key driver for the legacy cloudification market will be the openness of the software registry platform (and price of course). It is a very flexible system and it will be very interesting to see new payment and reimbursement models be built on top of the transaction framework.    
  
But, the software registry will also be a key piece of infrastructure for the decentralised web 3.0. If (when?) we see the decentralised web develop it will have profound implications for how we interact with the web we know today. This will create a completely new market where Golem will provide a key part of the infrastructure.  
  
Also, because the possibilities and the vision is so big they will have a lot of work over the coming years to showcase and build solutions and concepts that showcase these possibilities. Without knowing too much about the detailed plans and skills of the Golem team, for me it seems like the first applications that will be available are either computer resources (as a Amazon EC2 marketplace) and on the software repository side microservice like applications that will run independently and handle direct requests or by working on job queues. To get into highly parallel applications that do distributed supercomputing (which I guess is the end goal) a LOT of work is required and this is a research field in itself. Maybe we will see third parties develop this, but it will take time.  
  
My main concern is the lack of a direct monetization plan. The Golem team will have around four years to figure out a viable monetization strategy which I don't think will be a major concern. Building on their expertise with the platform I expect them to bring apps to the software registry themselves, and probably also find other income streams on the platform (such as escrow services, web 3.0 infrastructure services etc.). The ICO participants will get their tokens, and because there is no reissuance of tokens they should appreciate in value as usage of the Golem platform grows.  
  
### Product/Business/Operating Plan 4/5  
**Proof of concept available? How many iterations are done? MVP available? Is the product validated by outside users? 4/5**  
They have an alpha release available [github](https://github.com/imapp-pl/golem) with a working implementation of distributed Blender/LuxRender rendering, which will also be the first public use case.  
  
**What is the current operating plan and why do they need funding *now*? 4/5**  
Up until now the Golem project has been privately funded. From what I understand they have now reached the first proof of concept stage and to scale out and finance continued accelerated development they need additional funding. Also, because the Golem is built as a network a crowdsale in the proposed form is also a very good way to bootstrap the network of potential requestors, providers and software developers.  
  
**What is the go-to market strategy? 5/5**  
This is one of the sections that is vastly improved in the final white paper and is now by far the best in any ICO/white paper I've read. It's not too elaborate, but very much to the point. We are given an overall market strategy and for each of the four major milestones the main objectives and value proposition for that release and how this relates to each of the major stakeholders in the network (requestors, providers, software developers). Even if this was internally clear before I think it's hugely important to show to us as potential investors. At least to me this explains the purpose of each release and what we can expect in a much clearer way than the feature propositions.  
  
**Roadmap 4/5**  
This is another section that is so much improved. It is impossible to estimate and promise exactly what will be delivered several years from now in a project like this, but it gives us a much better understanding and helps us set the right expectations for the long term development of the project. So not only is it good for potential ICO participants, but also for the long term value of the token itself.    
  
Brass Golem - 6 months after crowdfund  
Clay Golem - 6-15 months (depending on scope and financing level reached)  
Stone Golem - 15-24 months  
Iron Golem - 24-48 months  
  
Depending on the level of financing reached the scope for each release will be adjusted, with extra features built in. I cannot say of this is realistic or not, but it seems they have made a considerate effort to realistically estimate each release. What is important for all potential investors to understand is that this is a multi year project, and with this roadmap this should be very clear.  
  
### Competition 3/5  
**Do they have a clear view of the competition? How do they plan to beat them? 3/5**  
  
Clearly they know about the other cloud PAAS and IAAS providers. Instead of addressing the competitors directly, they describe how Golem will be a more efficient and competitive market, the potential and benefits of the application repository and web 3.0 infrastructure. They don't address the competitors directly, which is why I score this section neutral (3).  
  
### Valuation 3/5  
**Is valuation sane? 3/5**  
They will be raising between 150 000 and 820 000 ether, with 6 % going to the founders and an additional 12 % to Golem Factory GmbH. This puts a maximum current value of Golem to 1 000 000 ether or roughly 12 million USD. This is a lot of money, but it includes the funds raised and a team of 10 people that I believe already have worked around a year on the project which is why I score it neutral.  
  
**Crowdsale and token structure 3/5**  
I think the crowdfund structure as described is neutral (not worse than the other recent successful ICOs, but not better either). There are still a couple of points that I would have liked to be be different from the eyes of an investor:  
* All money is available upfront, there is no safety mechanism if something happens in the project. I would have liked a yearly progress fund release schedule (or a third at a time), with the investors being able to halt the next payout in case of some grave mishandling  
* No vesting for the founders - at least it's not clear if the team and founders are vesting their tokens. I hope we will see a standard emerge where teams and investors always vest their tokens for at least 2 years, with a 6 month cliff (meaning no tokens at all for the first 6 months). In Golem they have a 6 month holding period (i.e. cliff) but no vesting after that  
* Unclear strategy to raise more funds if needed (there is a token upgrade option, but unclear how that will be used)  
  
The three points above are not unique to Golem, but very standard practice in the venture capital world and something the crypto world should adapt as soon as possible.  
  
### Legality 4/5  
**As an investor? 4/5**  
The short version is that the GNT token is used in much the same way as Ether (for gas) in the Ethereum ecosystem. Also, they use the same incorporation structure with a company based in Switzerland that controls the funds from the crowdsale and the holding company in turn employs various contractors for development and the completion of the project. If it works for the Ethereum foundation it will work for Golem as well.  
  
The longer version can be read in the 8 page [GNT Terms Document](https://golem.network/doc/GNTterms.pdf).  
  
Recently I've seen a lot of discussions around ICOs and their legality in relation to the US SEC (Securities and Exchange Commission) rules. Remember, Golem Factory is a European company controlled by European citizens, the SEC has no jurisdictions there and it's up to each participant to figure out if they are allowed to back this project or not.  
  
**Legality of the business 4/5**   
Should be the same as other cloud computing operators, so nothing special.  
  
### Security 4/5  
**Proof of external security evaluation? 3/5**  
Each major release will be audited by external auditors, and a significant amount of funds are set aside for this. In the [GNT terms document](https://golem.network/doc/GNTterms.pdf) they state the code is audited (I assume the GNT token contract code), but I have not seen a public report on it. But, all development of the Golem project is pushed to their public GitHub page, it has been publicly available for at least 10 months so no secrets there.  
  
**Special security needs for this project? 4/5**  
Throughout the text they describe the complexity of a project like Golem and many different security implementations they are planning, so all investors should be very well aware of this. That is really good. This is bleeding edge technology that is not developed yet, and making sure that we as outsiders really understand this is good. As I wrote earlier, I think the security needs of this project are as high or even higher than for the Ethereum project itself. We already see that there are many different security solutions being planned on different levels of the platform, and they have a cautious release plan that will hopefully discover and iron out lots of the security exploits and issues as the following releases are being developed.  
  
## Conclusion - Positive  
Golem is a very interesting project and in my opinion the white paper is the best ICO white paper released so far. The paper is well balanced and the project itself is fantastically ambitious that use blockchain technology not only to disrupt a huge (and growing) established market, but could also enable a key part of the needed infrastructure for the fully decentralised and autonomous web 3.0.  
  
What I also like and respect is the open and transparent approach they have used since the project start. We as outsiders should not control the project and the team should not act based on wishes from the community. But, they are open and ask for feedback, and when feedback is given they clearly consider it and act on it in order to improve. They have an active blog and from what I have seen so far I am very positive that they will contribute back to the Ethereum community outside of just the Golem project.  
  
Just one example that I personally think speaks very highly of their capacity is the blog post about writing the [GNT Crowdfunding Contract](https://blog.golemproject.net/gnt-crowdfunding-contract-in-pictures-d6b5a2e69150#.2idvuis3g). It's an easy read and this is the best 7 minute introduction to professional software development that I have seen. If you want to know the difference between bedroom hacking and software development this post is well worth a few minutes of your time.  
  
In my preliminary analysis I had some concluding points where I wanted to see improvement and more information. Let's review these points:  
* More and better team info - not only did they include team info, but also some very good rationale for their team selection, overall team background and achievements and they have also recruited since the draft white paper  
* Budget - the min and max cap size differ around 5 times. We now have a much better understanding for how they plan to spend the funds, and how different funding levels will affect the planned scope of the Golem project  
* A market strategy is needed - the go-to market strategy in integrated into the paper giving a much better understanding of the project and the rationale for each milestone. This was a huge improvement and something I hope other projects will learn from  
* I hope to see some external due diligence of code they have published so far - I still hope that someone better at software development than me will review the code (that is publicly available) and post something about the perceived quality level. The positive side is the blog post mentioned above and the planned security reviews  
* A much better roadmap is needed - we got it, and I think they really hit the sweet spot of detail in this as the future will be very uncertain  
* The crowdsale strategy could be improved - all funds are still available upfront and there is no vesting schedule for the team, founders and early investors (although there is a 6 month cliff)  
* More and deeper security discussions are needed, along with time tables - check on this. Everyone reading the white paper should understand it will take several years to deliver on the vision of the Iron Golem and the complexity of a project like this.  
  
So, point by point they made huge improvements (except for immediate release of all funds) and with the disposition and layout also much improved I think this project is now much easier to understand and to evaluate. I strongly encourage everyone interested in the crowdsale to read it and make up their own mind. I can only say I think it's the best handled ICO process so far and it has the best documentation I've seen, and as a project it's one of the most interesting we have seen in the crypto space.

"Paul Puey on the Blockchain show: Airbitz becomes a multicurrency wallet and mobile key manager, securing your identity on dApps","Airbitz had already integrated with Augur (see the ""login with Airbitz"" button at https://app.augur.net/?page=register ) 

In this [interview at the Blockchain show](http://www.theblockchainshow.com/24-paul-puey-from-airbitz/) he explains how Airbitz can be integrated with dApps  using the Airbitz SDK: https://airbitz.co/#sdk 

Users can safely hold their private keys and log in  into dApps using Edge login, by scanning a bar code: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73ISfWw_jNk

Topics deeper in the interview: 

* 10'20'' : difference with uPort: Airbitz concentrates on keeping the keys secure  across blockchains, and on encryption of data.  uPort concentrates on key revocation and restoring specifically for Ethereum. 
* 15'10'' : keyloggers and screen capture malware as two main risks for identity/credential theft 
* 22'20'' on blockchain use cases: Augur, p2p insurance, p2p trading
* 25' : Public/private key authentication via mobile as a generic way to authenticate to IOT devices
* 28' : using the Airbitz plugin system to port your dApp to Airbitz so your dApp can live within the Airbitz wallet and rely on the security of Airbitz to hold your Ether and different tokens.
* 30' : on the BTC blockchain debate, and ICOs as a use case for BTC even with expensive transaction fees.
* 33' : on the Airbitz crowdfund campaign (the first one under the JOBS act using BTC)
* 39' : on Arcade City.  Does not believe it's a scam, might have been badly executed so it becomes perceived as a scam (the interview was probably recorded before Paul Puey [joined the project as a keyholder](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWKzHlbq2jg) (of the funds multisig).
* 43' : says more announcements and cooperations with dApps will follow
* 53'20'' : Airbitz following the bitID standard and providing a generic way of creating an account just by scanning a barcode

RBS Article,"Strange the RBS article here posted 18 hrs ago seems to be gone for some reason.

"The Arcade City white paper is 17 pages long. Only 3 of these discuss how the underlying technology will actually work. The rest is about the ICO, business strategy, project history, and the dev team. This isn't what white papers are for.","Both the [bitcoin](https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf) and [ethereum](https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/White-Paper) white papers are prime examples of what a white paper should focus on: What is the value of the proposed technology, and how can it be built?

A white paper is a piece an interested person can read if they are considering investing their time and capital into a project. It's the opposite of an elevator pitch: assume the reader will pay good attention and give you all the time you need, then explain the tech from start to finish, leaving nothing out.

The [Arcade City white paper](https://arcade.city/AC-whitepaper.pdf) is a different story. Only three pages--at the end of the paper--discuss how the technology actually works. In those three pages, there is some detail given, but not nearly the amount that should be expected from a white paper. The fact that they detail the ICO before (and more fully than) the technology is particularly galling; it implies funding is more important than the structure of the product itself.

When you participate in an ICO, you're rewarded with tokens that grants you use of the technology. If the technology succeeds and provides value, your tokens will be valuable; if the technology fails your tokens will be worthless. So why dedicate a white paper to anything other than filling out all the details of the technology?",165.0,2016-11-04 14:52:34,0.95
The Crowdsale Analyst: Inchain - Where is the market?,"This will be a very short review of the [Inchain](https://ico.inchain.io/) project. There is a number of ICOs going on or that will shortly be started, so in this case I will highlight what stands out the most for me and then continue on and look at other projects.  
  
As far as I know the ICO started on October 27, and aims to go on until November 22. At the time of writing 6847 eth has been raised.  
  
I'm subjectively scoring each of the below categories from 0 to 5, where 3 should be neutral in the eyes of the investor. Below 3 is bad for the investor and above 3 is good for the investor (and could be good for the project as well). At the end I'll add a conclusion where I rate the whole ICO based on the combined information I have as negative, neutral or positive.  
  
## Project: Inchain  
Inchain is a decentralised insurance platform, that will be created to mitigate risks of crypto assets due to cyber attacks and hacks. What stands out to me when reading about the project is that no software has been built, and there is no demo, proof of concept or minimum viable product. So, basically they are marketing and selling a business idea with this ICO.  
  
#### Market Potential 0/5  
I will make this review short and only focus on the market potential for Inchain. The core vision they describe is decentralised insurance for crypto assets against cyber attacks and theft. The problem with this approach is that I don't see any market at all. Sure, there is a problem with hacks and thefts for crypto exchanges but creating a complicated platform and raising risk capital for this seems like the wrong approach. This problem will be dealt with in at least three ways over the coming months and years (all probably here before Inchain will be able to release a product):  
1. Next generation exchanges. There is rapid development going on for decentralised and relay type exchanges (such as [ShapeShift](https://shapeshift.io/#/coins) and [EtherDelta](https://etherdelta.github.io/#PLU-ETH)). These will not require you to hold any funds in the exchange, eliminating the risk of losing funds in a hack.  
2. Better security. Systems that increase transaction security and reduce risk of errors are coming. A prime example is [uPort](https://uport.me/).  
3. Prediction markets. [Augur](https://www.augur.net/) and [Gnosis](https://www.gnosis.pm/) will be launching within the next few months. I expect there will be prediction markets for the hack of your favourite exchange available, and just joining one of these will be the same service as Inchain plan to provide.  
  
## Conclusion - Negative  
Given the points above, even if Inchain does develop a working and secure product in reasonable time, I just I don't see how Inchain will be able to develop a sustainable business. Therefore I score the market potential to 0, and with no market I don't see a point in going on with the analysis. I will gladly consider feedback and continue on with the analysis if I'm given good arguments for why this service is needed and why it will be chosen instead of the prediction markets listed above.  
  
Edit/addition:  
Blockchain based insurance is very interesting and I would love to see a project (like this) go live and show us the possibilities. However, in this case even if I wanted I could not have completed my usual analysis of an ICO. As a reminder I go through the following sections:  
Team/Founders - presented on the website which is great  
Product/Business/Operating Plan - only product road map, no business plan and no budget  
Valuation - No min and no max cap which raises a huge warning flag  
Competition - not covered on website/white paper  
Legality - not covered on website/white paper  
Security - not covered on website/white paper  
  
With this little information available it would have been a very short review in any case, and to give some constructive feedback I hope the team can go back and update the website and release a white paper v 1.1 before the ICO ends, which would make it possible for potential ICO participants to seriously consider this project.

Golem crowdfunding starts on 11th November,"We are pleased to formally announce that Golem crowdfunding will start on 11th November, at approximately 3 pm GMT. 

It will last for three weeks, or until the maximum cap of 820,000 ETH is reached. The contract will be deployed to Ethereum mainnet and Its address will be announced a day before the crowdfunding opens.

Here is the most important information to know about the crowdfunding:

- The maximum financing is 820,000 ETH.
- The minimum financing is 150,000 ETH.
- 1 ETH creates 1,000 GNT.
- An 18% endowment is included (12% Golem Factory GmbH, 6% team).
- No new token creation will take place after the crowdfunding period.
- GNT will be transferable once the crowdfunding successfully completes.
- Endowment tokens will be locked for 6 months.

We also recommend the following for further reading:

4. [Final Golem Whitepaper](https://golem.network/doc/Golemwhitepaper.pdf)

5. [Crowdfunding Web page](https://golem.network/crowdfunding.html)

PARTICIPATION

To participate in the crowdfunding, you will need to send ETH to the crowdfunding address, from an address you fully control, not earlier than at the start block of the crowdfunding. You should use your own wallet, with a password-protected private key. We will provide detailed information on how to use wallets shortly.

Sending ETH to a crowdfunding address directly from an exchange will likely result in the loss of your ETH. Do not do that! We are not working with the exchanges on the integration of their services with the Golem crowdfunding contract. If such a service is offered, please be aware that it is provided by an exchange independently, and is not a part of our crowdfunding code. Proceed with caution.

THANKS

Both myself and the whole Golem team would like to thank all of our supporters and Golem  enthusiasts for being with us on this journey.

ETH Stolen,"I am not very technical and cannot validate my own claim. However, I am very careful in what I installed on my computer. Lately the only thing that I have done is installed the nheqminer and nheqminer_supernova to mine ZEC in the past 3 days. It went without any incident until this morning when Windows Defender indicated there is a malware found ""Win32/Bham.C!cl"". I checked my MIST wallet and saw my 1245.62 ETH was transferred out.

I hope some Developers read this. I just have some thoughts for ya if you don't get enough love when you need it. The prose is all I got. I can't code but I do make some damn good food if you ever wanna chat. I'm 30 minutes from the KC Airport.,"I love the transparency and willingness to communicate faults in the code with this dev team.  You are building something very special and large in purpose and none of it is easy or without discourse from other very intelligent people.  **To sticky a blog post about a known security flaw knowing that it's gonna cause some frustration only makes me more bullish than ever.**  


It seems as though very few contract types will be effected...like 1%...? But that 1% matters. They are contracts enabled by people we are talking about.  That 1% is someday going to be me, or my dad, or my brother that is affected and the dream of a contract system like Ethereum vastly depends on being right much more than 99.9% of the time.  It's going to happen.  This takes years to develop.  The truth is the hardest thing to prove in almost every context but math has the power to do it.  Remember, Ethereum wasn't just dropped on our lap by an unknown person.  These people on the dev team are working on their reputations, fighting off attacks, and building something every single day. Can you say that you spend your hours everyday at that level?  



It's so easy for people looking in to poke, prod, punch, and punk out errors and philosophies as it fits their narrative from a distance. It's another to actually go in and take on the bug bounties and contribute and risk your own reputation.  I'm in awe and the kool-aid tastes great.  I pour myself and my beliefs on video from time to time. I don't really offer more than opinion but it's something fun and I like to do it. I know 10 years from now I won't regret it because I speak from the heart and I'm quick to admit if I'm wrong. Humility isn't easy.  Apply yourself to the world wherever you think you can have the most impact.


I failed Freshman Algebra in High School and Statistics in college.  I've been in tears with math. I can't do it well. But I've always been a fan of science. Sadly, it wasn't my path.  

I'm yet another fish who knows not a thing about coding but all the vitriol against the dev team by others incredibly smarter than me has me believing even more in this project and I know all the hard work is going to pay off.  When the intelligent challenge the intelligent then motivation, inspiration, and a willingness to fight grow each day.  It will only make you better.  I finally passed my math classes because I was trying to make a newer, better version of myself.  


Keep being honest with your work, your abilities, your philosophies and the sleepless nights are going to get more restful eventually. **It's hard to see beautiful countryside when you are trying to look out through the walls of a tornado.** A fantastic tornado that will rip through the markets eventually and penetrate the backend work of a major business, institution, government, or even Grandma's grocery store inventory.  She's gonna love blockchain without even knowing it.



It's my ultimate dream and bucketlist goal to get some dev team members around my fire pit in KC so I can throwdown an interview and a meal with you all someday.  An outdoor fireside chat about the philosophies of ETH and really anything would be great. I'm great at cooking. I'm great at teaching little kids music. I'm great at DJing and entertaining. That's what (I feel) I'm great at. I'm also very honest and loyal. I see this attitude in the dev team.  

I see a bunch of people (brilliant really) using technology to communicate in ways undreamed 10 years ago to formulate an idea based on a technology that came to life 7 years ago and forge it into a working idea that started 2 years ago with a little guy from Canada and a couple of his friends.  



I see collaborations and people working together internationally for a belief that even the 1% at the top can't ignore.  



Keep crushin' these bugs and do great things in your own world.  I'll keep pickin' bugs out of my Kool-aid back here in Kansas and continue to read, learn, and inspire others to take a look.  

Big Hugs from Kansas.

We built AuctionHouse: a decentralized app on Ethereum for auctioning on-chain goods. Feedback requested,"My buddy /u/tangxiao57 and I spent some time over the last couple weeks building [AuctionHouse](http://auctionhouse.dappbench.com), an auction protocol and dapp for auctioning non-fungible, on-chain assets like virtual goods, domain names, real world assets represented by on chain tokens, and more. Read more about it in [this Medium post](https://medium.com/@petkanics/introducing-auctionhouse-an-ethereum-dapp-for-auctioning-on-chain-goods-c91244bde469#.hd80ooo45). 

It's currently in alpha, on the Morden Testnet, running at (http://auctionhouse.dappbench.com)

A walkthrough for how to use the UI is [available here](https://medium.com/@ericxtang/auctionhouse-walk-through-67f4ca5019cf#.dhjmq4h0k)

And the code and contracts are available [on Github](https://github.com/dob/auctionhouse).

It's definitely a work in progress, but we wanted to put it out in the open early to get some feedback from the community on some of the open questions. Namely:

* There's no standard yet for ownership and transfer of non-fungible assets, like there are for tokens with ERC20. How can we securely or socially verify that an asset's transfer of ownership conforms to spec so that we can securely transfer the asset to the winning bidder?
* Right now we have one economic incentive built into the protocol for stakeholders to promote and drive bids to auctions. The distribution cut. What other incentives would you like to see built into this to make it fully sustainable, yet decentralized?

Thanks, and we look forward to any feedback or security issues you see with [the contracts](https://github.com/dob/auctionhouse/tree/master/contracts).

PS - this was built using Truffle, web3, and tested with Metamask - all great tools from our experience.

WeTrust (dApp) Startup is looking for developers (competitive salary)!,"Hi all, 

My name is Patrick Long and I’m working on an blockchain/ Ethereum decentralized application (dApp) named WeTrust. WeTrust will be a blockchain driven and Ethereum powered platform promoting transparency and financial inclusion through non-profit and reciprocal aid organizations. 

Our initial product will be the ROSCA, but rather than using traditional means of organizing/ distributing funds, WeTrust aims to leverage the blockchain to reduce friction and management costs. Informal banking is a multi-billion dollar industry plagued with high fees and issues related to transparency that must be disrupted. In the future, we plan to expand the ROSCA concept to include more complex features such as: voting, insurance, P2P lending, etc. 

If this sounds interesting, please check out our pitch deck here (https://docsend.com/view/d8q5j64).

Update on Imminent Hard Fork [10/28/2016],"## Overview
Today core devs from every major client met to discuss the upcoming hard fork. Consensus was reached that the following EIPs will be implemented in the upcoming hard fork.

  - **[EIP 155 - Simple replay attack protection](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/155)**
  - **[EIP 160 - EXP cost increase](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/160)**
  - **[EIP 161 - State trie clearing (invariant-preserving alternative)](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/161)**

The hard fork block number will be decided on Monday based on analysis over the weekend of the time needed to write the code and write/perform tests.

## What do I need to do?

Users: Check frequently for updates to your Ethereum client. If you are using a third party to use Ethereum (web wallets, exchanges, etc.) the third parties will be responsible for upgrades on their backend systems and you shouldn't need to perform any actions.

Developers: Please review the specifications defined in the EIPs and the PRs from various clients that are implementing the hard fork.

"[rant] Status of Ethereum software, usability","Greetings,

I am a technical person, still I cannot manage my ethereum accounts easily. Over and over again I am getting problems and I feel I have to learn a lot until I even can transfer eth coins.

The website ethereum.org is really nice, the trouble starts when I click the link ""Download Ethereum wallet"". A page where I am told to upgrade to the latest version because of security issues, but all the versions are labeled ""beta"". 

I decided to install it anyway. Previously, I had 0.8.1, installed from a ZIP archive on linux 64 Bit, and I have two accounts and I am watching some contracts. Downloaded the newest version 0.8.7, linux 64 Bit .deb. Checked the checksum. Installed and started it. Now Ethereum Wallet starts downloading blocks, but when I click ""Launch Application"" all my accounts and contracts are gone. Worse, when I create a new account using this UI, it will not show up. 

When I start old version 0.8.1, it *does* show my accounts.

Duckduckgoing for the problem creates more questions. Some people are using different clients, like parity, or geth, although the latter seems to be part of my ethereum wallet, because it is running now and uses a lot of memory. 

When I click on ""backup"" / ""accounts"", my file manager is launched in directory ""~/.ethereum"" with no further explanation and that's it. (In the ""keystore"" folder three account files exist.) When I click on ""show logfile"", the exact same thing happens, in a different directory "".config/Ethereum Wallet"" where there are several files and directories, only one of them is an obvious logfile: ""node.log"". This does not help me with the above problem. Another thing raises my interest: There is a directory ""binaries"" and it contains ""geth""... and ""archive.tar"".... this looks like the Ethereum Wallet program downloads additional binaries at runtime? wtf? ok, this is not a usability issue; still this must give a cold shiver to any it admin.

Conclusion: From a simple user's perspective, the first impression of ethereum (.org) is nice. After the first click, you are partly lost.

PSA: The Golem ICO Tokens do NOT give you any percentage of revenue from the transactions on the network.,"Didn’t really see this mentioned publicly (at least not easily) after they removed fees from the system, so I wanted to give people a heads-up in-case they still thought they would get a percentage of the fees.

What does immutability really mean?,"So thinking a little about blockchain immutability - what does it really mean and is it black and white or are there shades of grey in there? I would suggest that EIP-150 was compliant from a ""don't mess with the chain"" immutability point of view.

To start I'd set down these basic rules about what hard-forks should comply to for at least a minimum grade of immutability:

- hard-forks should not alter the functional state of the system (i.e. all other things being equal, the outcome of a future transaction should stay exactly the same).
- hard-forks should not result in the removal of data from the pre-existing chain.

These two points are designed to address two separate kinds of ""messing with the chain"": In the first case, the idea of altering pre-existing state information (where it is still meaningful) as happened in the DAO hard-fork. In the second case it's the chain rollback situations where the chain-head is determined to be actually invalid and new blocks are mined in their position (presumably leaving out irksome transactions or under new rules).

EIP-150 was compliant under these rules even though it facilitates the alteration of the state trie in new ways (i.e. pinging an empty account with zero ether in order to ""garbage collect"" it from the state trie). This is because the state transition system can be demonstrated to imply a strict equivalence between empty and non-existent accounts.

There are those who would argue that EIP-150 was not entirely compliant with the notional ""immutability maxim"" since it still facilitated the alteration of the trie in new ways that can effect pre-existent state.

"Golem crowdfunding whitepaper: Release candidate, for community review","We are pleased to present today, the next version of our crowdfunding whitepaper. We have taken all community feedback into consideration, and we consider this version to be our release candidate. The refreshed whitepaper is available [here](https://golem.network/doc/ReleasecandidateGolemwhitepaper.pdf). But before diving in, please allow me first to describe what we have changed to address the critical feedback we’ve received, and why we stuck to some of our original ideas too.

I will first of all go through Daniel Zakrisson’s conclusions from [his great analysis](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/57x1oh/the_crowdsale_analyst_golem_preliminary_thoughts/) of our draft whitepaper (thank you Daniel once again for this great work).

>More and better team info - show us this is a killer team that can deliver the grand vision of the Golem. The team and their ability to execute will always be the most important part any startup project.

I truly believe that we are a great team -- and with the crowdfunding, we will be able to make it the best team that could deliver this project. We have expanded our team description in the whitepaper significantly, to give everyone more context on where we’ve come from, and who we are. This is complimented by the [this blog post](https://blog.golemproject.net/so-who-the-heck-are-we-anyway-27fc212c600e#.s27femm0e). 

>Budget - the min and max cap size differ around 5 times. From the description I don't see the ""Additional features"" offered in the max cap scenario being 5 times as complex as the min cap scenario. This leads to questions about how efficient funds in a max cap scenario will be used

This is indeed a really valid concern. From our point of view it is however, rather a question of if we are able to deliver everything we promise, if we do not reach the cap. We have redrafted the roadmap in this regard, with the most significant change being redesigned timeline and a clearer division of deliverables between milestones, in particular redefinition of the Iron and the removal of this release from the minimum cap scenario.

>A market strategy is needed

We have added a description of our plan here. In fact, we had originally spent quite a lot of time researching that, but the truth is that we had focused on technology in the draft whitepaper and skipped that almost completely. Now it is built into the roadmap section, as different releases will need different approaches.

We do not provide an analysis of “our competition” in the whitepaper, because we actually do believe that Golem is in fact not directly competing with anyone. If we consider other projects with goals which sound similar, it turns out that they either are not so similar after all, or they are completely dead -- just a webpage, with no developers or code behind the name. And, if we consider cloud providers and datacenters, the fact is that we do not want to compete with them. We want to give them an alternative (we believe much better) way of interacting with their customers. Whether they decide to use Golem or not is up to them, but I can say sincerely, that we have a lot of interest from small and medium-sized professional providers who consider Golem to be exactly the technology for them. So, though it may sound ironic on the surface, not “outcompeting” anyone will be critical. What will make Golem success is in fact to convince developers to integrate it, and for requestors to use it. And we now describe that in the go-to-market strategy in the whitepaper.     

>I hope to see some external due diligence of code they have published so far - from a security and ability point of view

and

>More and deeper security discussions are needed, along with time tables

We are doing through security checks of the crowdfunding contract, including an external audit by Zeppelin which will most likely be presented next week.

I am not sure if there is a serious point in doing a security audit of the Golem alpha right now, because even without it, we know very well that it is not secure, and we will be addressing all of these issues over the next couple of months. In fact, a significant improvement to Golem’s security is one of the most important things to still be done for the Brass release. And an external security audit is planned for Brass as well.

On top of it all, security audits are really, really costly -- this is by far the largest component of the “contractors” part of our budget. So, we do not see the point of financing an external audit right now, as we are not able to afford one pre-crowdfunding anyway. We are of course aware that security is critical though, hence we’ve added a section where we summarize how we want to attack the issues we know about. And as you know, we have Alex Leverington on board, who is obsessed with this topic, and rightly so.

>A much better roadmap is needed so that the investors can hold the developers accountable for the progress of the project


The problem is that, with this type of project, any commitment is a risk… Not because you are not willing to keep the promise, but because it is very hard to estimate the effort needed beforehand. Recall for example how we waited and waited for Frontier, and the planned release date was not announced. This is completely understandable: developers did not want to commit to dates they were not sure they will be able to meet. That is why we do not really have precise ETAs for Metropolis and Serenity, as far as I know. For Golem it is a similar case.

Even still, we have reviewed the roadmap in this regard, and have decided to present our general estimates for every release and piece of key functionality. We have used this number while working on the budget. I do hope that the community will understand why it is done this way. If anything is not clear, please ask.

>The crowdsale strategy could be improved in order to give the project, founders and investors better incentives to create a great project

I will just explain what we are doing, and why.

The crowdfunding will be conducted in the simplest manner possible. It will last three weeks, or until the cap is reached. The conversion rate will be flat during the whole crowdfunding - no discounts, no presales. Tokens will be transferable right after the crowdfunding ends. We do not work with exchanges to facilitate early token trading or the integration of crowdfunding contract into their services.

I am aware of ongoing discussions about how to make crowdfunding better, to ensure for example high distribution of the token (reduction of the purchases) or to maximize revenue (Dutch auction). However, we have a feeling, that we cannot be on every bleeding-edge technological frontier. :) Contracts might be short, but they are complicated too, and we do not want to take this risk right now. We have our own ideas about how this could be done, and perhaps we will work on that at some point (as imapp, not as Golem), but our key priority now is to finance the project. 

All crowdfunding money is upfront. This is somehow standard when crowdfunding projects with tokens. I do realize this is not a standard for VC style financing, but we would need to either add governance to the crowdfunding contract (which would, with some simplification, mean creating a DAO - and we are not ready for the risks involved, as probably are not potential participants) or we do that in rounds. This again brings its own risks, which can be summarized as non being able to finance the project without violating commitment to the first-round token holders, regardless of how successful the project is. 

The company and developers’ endowment will be locked for 6 months. Why 6 months only? Because we want to push our first major release in 6 months, and because the lock-up is not compliant with the migration feature of the token. As we are sure we will have to upgrade the token at some point, we do not want to risk a situation where we have to hold up Golem network progress, to wait for the end of lock-up period. Yet I want to declare, that if the company is to do anything with its 12% endowment before we are done with what we promise in the roadmap, it will be only to finance Golem’s further development.

The developers’ endowment is distributed among 23 people, with the majority (almost 90%) going to 11 people who we believe to be critical to the project’s success.  

We also had some comments (not from Daniel’s post) that the token design we propose is inferior to our our original (fee-based) ideas. We do not agree with that and I have described why in a [separate blog post](https://blog.golemproject.net/why-no-fee-45a9496b033e#.tsp2hkex6).

We put this updated whitepaper before you, with the hope that we are coming to the end of the beginning, and that we will be able to call it “final” after this weekend. With the presentation of the contract code scheduled for Monday, we are planning to announce our crowdfunding date next week. As with all we do within Golem, this will not be some ninja-stealth announcement; we will set the date at least a couple of days in advance. So the crowdfunding will start at the very end of October, or the first days of November, most likely.

Miners: please run with --targetgaslimit 2000000 (geth) or --gas-floor-target 2000000. There's no reason to lower it further than this level; for some reason many miners are still targeting either 1m or 500k.,"Gas limit currently at 1.2m; it's been decreasing by ~100k per 4 hours for the past day and a half. Uncle rates back during full DoS spam at 2m were at ~0.25-0.3, so lowering the limit to 1.2m is excessive.

Note that some client developers are considering a dynamic gas limit formula where the gas limit target would keep going up slowly, and then come back down every time they see a block that subjectively takes them more than 2 seconds to process. This would allow for an appropriate gas limit to be maintained to ensure network health without the need for manual intervention on the miners' part to change target gas limit flags; I support this proposal.

Note on incentives: some erroneously believe that miners may have the incentive to vote the uncle rate down further because they want to lower the uncle rate to preserve their revenues. However, miners' revenues **as a whole** do not at present go down when uncle rates go up (because the difficulty targeting algorithm targets blocks per minute and not blocks + uncles per minute), and targeting a lower gas limit does not affect you any differently from any other miners. **--targetgaslimit is a vote on global consensus parameters, not a private transaction policy setting**. If miners are concerned about their own personal uncle rate, then their existing strategy of raising gas prices during DoS attacks does that job quite well.",189.0,2016-10-21 13:25:26,0.93

Vitalik comment regarding the reality of these recent attacks and the subsequent hardforks.,"Thought this recent post by Vitalik really sums up well the reality of these attacks and the subsequent hardforks.

""I would not call what has been happening so far ""weekly whack-a-mole""; I would call it a progressive hardening of the geth and parity clients against DoS attacks, with the attacker each time having to resort to picking increasingly high-hanging fruit. The design of the system now satisfies stronger invariants than it did before. Changes like state change journaling and now the on-disk state cache are NOT band-aids, they are large architectural improvements that would have been eventually necessary anyway.""

Mist UX,"Windows Mist UX makes no sense.

1. It used to be distributed as a ZIP which was easy to manage. Users (like me) simply extracted it into Program Files directory. (This is where apps live on Windows).

2. Now, Mist is distributed as an EXE. You'd think this is an installer, right? Wrong. When I run this EXE it seems to provide a funny little animated gif, extracts Mist to the C:\Users\<Username>\AppData\Local\Mist\app-0.8.6 folder and runs it without asking.

3. Since when are application installed into the AppData folder? 

4. Since when do installers not provide users options to choose installation folder and simply determine themselves where to install?

5. After running this EXE, it just starts up a new node and starts syncing without considering if I wanted to install somewhere else, without considering what folder I wanted the data directory to be in, without considering if I already have a data-folder somewhere or an existing wallet that I want to keep using. Nope, it just assumes the ""easy case scenario"" of a fresh install on a single-drive machine with large space -- apparently, no need to consider alternative scenarios and no need to ask user anything at all. 

Okay, if you can stomach that, then:

A. ~~This pseudo-installer does not even create icons or shortcuts anywhere at all~~. So, after you close it, you can't re-open it. Since it doesn't tell you what folder it's installed to, how are users supposed to re-run it? The AppData folder is hidden in windows, so you can't even see it without enabling ""View Hidden Files"" (which 0.1% of machines have). The only way to re-run it is to open up Task Manager on the first run, track the location of process executable via task manager, and then add your own manual shortcut to the executable in the AppData folder. (BAD - just lost 99% users) 

~~B. Geth is no longer available as a separate executable which some windows users rely and depend on to run with custom command line arguments (since Mist itself will not propagate command line arguments to geth on Windows). Now, it seems geth is embedded in Mist?  Is this why the Mist executable is 84MB?~~

**UPDATE** geth is in roaming folder (should be in Program files)


How much QA goes into this stuff? Very disappointed. Am supposed to demo contract deployment to a meetup today but now I have to re-sync everything onto drive without the capacity? Literally blocked, can't fix. I'd run the prior version but cannot due to HF. Great work guys!

Can We Stop With The Hate?,"Despite the flaws in ether.camp's presale, Roman and his team are valuable members of the Ethereum community. I would hate to see them, or anyone else, driven away in any part due to the negativity and attacks that are popping up on this subreddit. If you don't believe in their project or presale, don't buy in - simple as that. The major flaws have already been outlined in explicit detail by multiple parties. If you'd like to expose more flaws or express a constructive opinion on the matter, please do so. But the petty, nonconstructive attacks are in no way productive for the community.

Update on HF 2 and client optimizations,"* Geth developers are working on an optimization that will store a direct on-disk table representing account storage, allowing accounts to be accessed in O(1) leveldb reads instead of O(log(n)) leveldb reads as is the case now. Preliminary tests suggest a 5x speedup in processing account reads if this is done. This is a fairly large change to the client (not quite but almost as complex as journaling) so don't expect it out tomorrow, but it will make a large difference.
* Simpler optimizations on the in-memory trie cache are achieving ~30% speedups.
* We're looking at simple forms of state tree pruning to allow nodes to reduce their storage size without having to delete the DB and fast sync from scratch. This should increase processing time indirectly.
* The main debate in the hard fork discussions is whether to implement [EIP 158](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/158) with section 2 or with (1c) (there is little value in doing both). The two carry different risks; section 2 is more complex from an in-EVM consensus standpoint, whereas (1c) requires more substantial re-architectures in other areas of geth to implement, as iterating through all accounts is not a use case that needed to be supported in all nodes before.
* We are considering adding replay protection, likely either [EIP 155](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/155) or a simpler trick involving using the upper bits of the tx nonce as a chain ID, but nothing is yet finalized.",187.0,2016-10-20 17:44:24,0.95

The Crowdsale Analyst: ether.camp - the altruistic hackathon platform?,"ether.camp is launching their crowdsale in just two days [hack.ether.camp/sale](https://hack.ether.camp/sale). This is one of the most loudly debated projects in recent weeks, mainly because of their 50 million USD cap on the crowdsale. 50 million? Yes, they have actually put a cap at 50 million on this thing. I don't know Roman Mandeleil and have never used any of the products ether.camp have developed, so I'm looking at this crowdsale purely based on the information given on the website, the white paper, the ether.camp blog and recent ether.camp Reddit discussions.

I'm very subjectively scoring each section on a scale of 1 to 5, where 3 should be neutral in the eyes of a potential investor.

##Project: ether.camp crowdfund
As described in the white paper:  
> ether.camp is a project aimed to create the ideal innovation environment for startups by utilising blockchain technology for the release of the Virtual Accelerator.  
  
ether.camp is a recurring hackathon event, with the second hackathon coming up shortly. According to a blog post they have 1700 hackers and fans (what does that mean?) signed up for the event. Before the event developers have been able to pitch ideas and form teams, and the goal during the five week event is to create products out of these ideas.  
  
###Team/Founders 1/5
**Do these guys have what it takes to succeed as entrepreneurs? Track record and previous projects? Experience and formal education? 1/5**  
This is tricky - because the only publicly known member of ether.camp is Roman Mandeleil. After a software dev career he join the Ethereum project and was the EthereumJ (Java client) lead developer in 2014, after which he left to start ether.camp. At ether.camp he has led several Ethereum based projects, such as Ethereum Studio, Ethereum Harmony, Ethereum Java Peer and live.ether.camp. To my knowledge none of these are commercial projects, so we have no real information about the teams ability to run a commercial platform. Roman has delivered on several projects and seems very well respected in the community (as seen by the judges they have attracted to the ether.camp hackathon). But, there is no mention and no information about the team in the white paper which is a huge miss. As I've said before - the team and their ability to execute on product, business and company formation is the absolutely most important part of any project.  
  
During the recent [Reddit AMA](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethtrader/comments/57xrve/ama_ethercamp_today_monday_17th_october_1700_gmt/) several red flags was raised from my perspective:  
* Roman said there is a dedicated team solely working on hack.ether.camp - but on the hack.ether.camp web site only two people are listed to work on hack.ether.camp (Mikhail Kalinin and Anton Maximov)  
* ether.camp governance, or lack thereof as stated by Roman in the AMA: 
> <ether.camp> is private company so we keep the inernal strucure private for now. I can be seen as a responsible for any project we do. 
Since the team is the most important success factor this lack of transparency is a huge issue for me.  
  
I'm sure Roman is a very competent person, but the answers given does not provide any assurance. This part of their proposal is downright bad.

###Market Potential 1/5
In the [AMA](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethtrader/comments/57xrve/ama_ethercamp_today_monday_17th_october_1700_gmt/d8w0ev8) the answer to monetization of the platform is very vague:  
> (Q) Thanks for your answers. As a follow up: Do you automatically expect the great user experience and startup ideas to turn into revenue and salaries for your team to go forward? Revenue is crucial for the sustainability of any business in the world - be it blockchain or normal.
  
> (A) I do agree that revenue is crucial for any buisness, but a startup can focus on the platform for some time and leave the monetization part for later. Google and Facebook are just 2 examples of such a story.
  
So no market vision in sight, which is another problem even if there surely are ways to monetise a successful platform. But, since this is not on the map currently we can at least be sure this is some (a long) time into the future.  
  
###Product/Business/Operating Plan 2/5
**Proof of concept available? How many iterations are done? MVP available? Is the product validated by outside users? 2/5**  
The first hackathon is already done, but I cannot find any information on the website that describes the outcome of this event. Did any of the projects or teams live on after the event?  
  
For the Virtual Accelerator platform itself it seems like some code is available [github](https://github.com/ether-camp/virtual-accelerator/tree/2529ffe5efd5294b44f1bc89dc9a4721a7b16409/contracts). But, the web site and white paper are still (2 days before the sale goes live) not complete and has only empty space where they are supposed to put code examples. But, since 50 % of all funds raised will go to platform development (from 0.5 to 25 million USD) this platform clearly has a lot of work left to do.

**What is the current operating plan and why do they need funding *now*? 1/5**  
They need funding in order to continue run the ether.camp hackathons, continue to expand their scope and finish development of the platform. But, very weak arguments are given for why they need money now and how much they really need. In the minimum funding scenario (still a wide span of 1-5 million USD) they say they will focus on platform development and move quickly to platform monetisation, which in my opinion sounds like a sound idea as it will show the viability of the platform as a commercial project sooner rather than later.  
  
Further, I have serious doubts about the ability the use funds efficiently given the very wide span they go for. Let's say they reach the max of 50 million USD, in this case 25 million USD goes to platform development. The website says they will spend this over three years before financing the platform with monetisation. 25 million USD equals a staff over 104 people (given a cost of $80 000 per employee per year) over the full three years on platform development alone - and this is for a platform without any public road map, vision or goals.
  
Another lacking point is that they have no plan or description of the team they are aiming to build. How many people are they going to recruit? In which positions? Who will the people leading this venture be?  
  

**What is the go-to market strategy? 0/5**  
None in the white paper, which needs addressing.

**Roadmap 2/5**  
A roadmap for the 2nd hackathon is given, but none for the platform development or other activities for which they raise money.  
  

###Competition 3/5
**Do they have a clear view of the competition? How do they plan to beat them? 3/5**    

They don't address the competition directly, but given the level of interest in the hack.ether.camp I would say this is the most well known hackathon in the Ethereum space. However, the ambition is clearly to reach outside of the Ethereum space and no clear strategy or who will be responsible for this is given.

###Valuation 1/5
**Is valuation sane? 1/5**  
For some reason I cannot understand they have chosen to set a maximum cap in the fundraise of 50 million USD. Five Zero Zero Zero Zero Zero Zero Zero dollars. They describe their project as doable with as little as 1 million USD, but have set the mega cap in order to avoid a crowdsale that ends in minutes, hours or days. Also, it's very important to note that the HKG token does not entitle to anything on the ether.camp platform [ether.camp blog](http://blog.ether.camp/post/151790264133/virtual-accelerator-past-present-and-future):  
> As it’s important for us to comply with US security regulations backers don’t have rights on any other part of the project - no IP, no revenue stream and no shared ownership.  
  
The only right given to holders of the HKG token is the possibility to participate in the first phase of crowdfunding for projects in ether.camp hackathons and vote on the use of funds in these projects.

As a token holder you can be an early adopter in hackathon projects, by exchanging HKG tokens for specific tokens released by the project (if I understand it correctly). This way the project gets HKG tokens that can be sold (for seed funding) and the token holder is now a first round investor in the project. This process is a 1:1 exchange between HKG tokens and project tokens. After the hackathon event the project can release 5 times as many tokens as released in the first round and these tokens will be available to the public for ether. Nothing is said about the pricing mechanism for this, or how the project will be able to mint and sell additional tokens at a later stage for further funding. Or does it stop there? This whole process seems a bit unpolished and not complete. Also, nothing says the project tokens will have any value at all.  
  
This means that the value of HKG tokens will come solely from what people are willing to pay for them in exchanges for the ability to participate as early adopters/backers in future hackathon events. This value will be balanced by the selling pressure from all hackathon projects selling  HKG tokens in exchange for ether/bitcoin in order to fund their projects.

**Crowdsale and token structure 1/5**
The crowdsale mechanism itself also have several of the usual issues we have seen in the space:  
* All money is available upfront
* No way of raising more funds through the HKG token, either if the project have difficulties or if it becomes a huge success
* Investor vesting is not even considered since there is no issuance of tokens to the ether.camp team - meaning there is a very low level of alignment of interest with the crowdsale backers.

If the max cap is only set because they want to give anyone interested the possibility to join, this could have been solved in so many other ways (e.g. pro-rata issuance, Dutch auction or something else) and instead they could have put a sane cap of 2-3 million USD which would still be a lot of money for a project like this.

###Legality 5/5
**As an investor? 4/5**  
As noted above they have taken care to avoid being considered an SEC security. However, this is not mentioned in the white paper or on the sale website, only in a blog post.

**Legality of the business 5/5**  
Nothing strange here


###Security 3/5
**Proof of external security evaluation? 2/5**  
To my knowledge one external security audit has been made, which was made public today (2 days before the sale starts) by Manuel Araoz [Zeppelin Medium](https://medium.com/zeppelin-blog/ethercamps-hacker-gold-hkg-public-code-audit-b7dd3a2fe43b#.7t9mr3yur). To me it looks a bit like the security audit published by Slockit on theDAO. They go through one of the contracts and give some general and some specific comments on the code. So far so good. What I don't like is that they start the audit by saying:  
> We’ve been asked by our friends at ether.camp to review the code for their soon-to-launch Hacker Gold (HKG) token, and to publish the results of our work.  

I would like security audits to be performed by hired, professional unrelated external auditors, not friends of the team. Further than that, what is interesting is not to only audit one specific contract, but how all contracts interrelate should also be audited.  
  
EDIT: The Zeppelin team contacted me and explained they were in fact hired to do the audit, it was just the blog post that had an misleading introduction.

**Special security needs for this project? 3/5**  
In general I would say no. But, given the extreme max cap on this projects it makes it another to big to fail project (if they raise the full amount). Can the community afford another security breakdown of this size?

##Conclusion 2/5
With the information available in these sources I have a very hard time understanding this project. They have a nice website and clearly ambitious plans, but they do not seem connected to reality. The tone I see in Romans AMA answers remind me of the tone Stephan Tual held before TheDAO debacle. I think a lot more openness, transparency and community engagement is needed. Roman also seem to be respected in the community, but this is not translated into any of the background info of the crowdsale.
  
I have several direct issues with the project:
* They don't give backgrounds of the team and only two people seems to be working on the project
* They don't give any information about the governance of the company that will be in control of all funds  
* Very vague rationale for how investors will get an ROI on their investment
* They have no strategy for how funds will be efficiently used in the wide range they are asking for  
* No company formation strategy, no market strategy described and no plan for an efficient team setup
* The only security audit so far is done by a friend of the project/team  
* The token issuance model could have been made much better in order to allocate funds to everyone interested  
* The white paper and the website are still unfinished and are missing content
  
On the other hand, a successful ether.camp could mean a lot to the Ethereum ecosystem. I just wish they could follow some of the best practices developed in the real world. Raise some seed money, build a first version, prove that the team can execute and then go from there.

Another important note, it seems like the HKG tokens and the project tokens they potentially can be exchanged into are never intended to carry any value - meaning that investing in ether.camp is not to be done if an ROI is expected on the investment.

The Crowdsale Analyst: Golem - Preliminary Thoughts,"Golem just announced a draft white paper for their upcoming crowdfunding [Golem blog](https://blog.golemproject.net/golem-crowdfunding-whitepaper-draft-release-f5b7b8a0cb06#.s1ubqo5zq). Since they are asking for community feedback I thought I would gather some of my preliminary thoughts here, based on my  approach to crowdfunding evaluations. 

I will not score each section, only highlight some key comments and questions in each category. Hopefully I'll be back with a full analysis once the final white paper is up.

###Project: The Golem Project
Golem aims to build the first decentralised supercomputer and together with that a market to price computer resources on this decentralised  computer. The easiest way to understand it is as a decentralised Amazon AWS service.

####Team/Founders 
**Do these guys have what it takes to succeed as entrepreneurs? Track record and previous projects? Experience and formal education?**  

The Golem team is already at 11 people, of which I think all work full time on the project. This means they already have a foundations for being able to scale their operations somewhat efficiently if/when raising a lot of funds. They mention a goal of growing the team to 20 people which is absolutely doable given their current size. 

The white paper lacks any real bios and backgrounds of the founding team and why they will be able to succeed in delivering this ambitious project - this is one of the most important points that must be addressed in the upcoming final white paper.


####Market Potential
The cloud compute market is a multi billion market dominated by large IT companies (such as Amazon, Google, Microsoft and IBM). Golems main advantage will be the possibility to offer lower cost compute resources based on more efficient usage of already purchased and not currently used  resources in homes and enterprises.

The main limitation will probably be to convince the market of the security and reliability of the platform. I’m missing a discussion of how to reach outside of the crypto market.


####Product/Business/Operating Plan
**Proof of concept available? How many iterations are done? MVP available? Is the product validated by outside users?**  
They have an alpha release available [github](https://github.com/imapp-pl/golem) with a working implementation of distributed Blender/LuxRender rendering.

**What is the current operating plan and why do they need funding *now*?**  
It is not clear what current funding they have, but clearly they need new funding in order to continue and ramp up development work in the project.


**What is the go-to market strategy?**  
None in the white paper, which clearly needs addressing.

**Roadmap**  
Brass Golem - 6 months after crowdfund
Clay Golem - no time frame
Stone Golem - no time frame
Iron Golem - no time frame

The milestones are very roughly drafted and no time frame is given except for the first alpha draft, I hope a lot more information is given 

####Competition  
**Do they have a clear view of the competition? How do they plan to beat them?**    

Clearly they know about the other cloud PAAS and IAAS providers. They mention more efficient markets, the application repository and web 3.0 infrastructure, but they don't address the competitors directly.

####Valuation 
**Is valuation sane?**  
They will be raising between 150 000 and 820 000 ether, with 6 % going to the founders and an additional 12 % to Golem Factory GmbH. This puts a maximum current value of Golem to 1 000 000 ether or roughly 12 million USD.

**Crowdsale and token structure**
I think the crowdfund structure as described is less than ideal for several reasons:  
* All money is available upfront  
* No vesting for the founders - should be at least over two years  
* No way of raising more funds through the GNT token, either if the project have difficulties or if it becomes a huge success  
* No token lockup period for investors  

It would like to see a discussion form the founders regarding these points.

####Legality 
**As an investor?**  
The GNT (for resource usage) is used in much the same way as Ether (for gas) in the Ethereum ecosystem, so it can probably be argued that they can piggyback on the Ethereum arguments in relation to SEC rules (and similar in other jurisdictions).

**Legality of the business**  
Should be the same as other cloud computing operators


####Security 
**Proof of external security evaluation?**  
Not available

**Special security needs for this project?**  
The security needs of the Golem projects I would say are the similar to that of the Ethereum project itself (=very complex). The projects have similar level of complexity, and as seen it will probably take a long time after the first live implementation to reach a stable and secure version. They address several attack vectors using a system of white lists and black lists, but the system is so complex so there will surely be unknown security holes.

###Conclusion 
Golem is a very interesting project, but I would like to see a much more comprehensive and accessible package of information before the crowdsale begins. My main areas where I would like to see improvements in the current white paper are:  
* More and better team info - show us this is a killer team that can deliver the grand vision of the Golem. The team and their ability to execute will always be the most important part any startup project.  
* Budget - the min and max cap size differ around 5 times. From the description I don't see the ""Additional features"" offered in the max cap scenario being 5 times as complex as the min cap scenario. This leads to questions about how efficient funds in a max cap scenario will be used  
* A market strategy is needed  
* I hope to see some external due diligence of code they have published so far - from a security and ability point of view  
* A much better roadmap is needed so that the investors can hold the developers accountable for the progress of the project  
* The crowdsale strategy could be improved in order to give the project, founders and investors better incentives to create a great project  
* More and deeper security discussions are needed, along with time tables  

It’s very refreshing that the Golem does provide this information beforehand, it shows they are serious about this. Hopefully they will continue to work with the community and be transparent as they progress with the crowdfunding plans.

48 hours til order is restored.,"What a roller coaster ride 2016 has been for the Ethereum community. We have experienced more in the last 5 months than bitcoin has in 5 years, and that has made us stronger. Each day I look forward to reading contributions from the devs and other smart minds on this thread. You guys really deserve a breather and for your sake I hope everything works out nicely over the next 48 hours and the network is back in full swing. So excited to see what the future of ETH brings!

A quick note on how the CALL gas cost increase will affect contracts.,"One of the features of EIP150 increases the gas cost of every type of call from 40 to 700. This gas cost is **in addition** to memory gas costs and the gas provided to the child; for example, if you currently call a contract with 300 gas, then the child gets 300 gas and the parent pays 340 gas (assuming no memory expansion), post fork the child would still get 300 gas but the parent would pay 1000 gas. So calls to contracts that provide less than 700 gas are not affected (unless the child itself consumes an opcode whose price has been greatly increased, but there are very few situations where this is the case).

Existing contracts often use `msg.gas - 40` to determine how much gas to send to call a child; because currently a call costs 40 gas, `msg.gas - 40` basically means ""send the child as much as we can"". However, with the patch, `msg.gas - 40 + 700 = msg.gas + 680` so these contracts would all be trying to send too much gas to the child. This is remedied by adding a rule that if a call tries to send the child too much gas, instead of failing the child is simply sent the maximum amount of gas that it can get. Hence, if your application relies on calling a contract with 50000 gas and you're used to sending transactions which (post base costs) have 50001 gas, and the cost now increases to 50680, then you can simply bump up the gas in your transactions slightly and it will again work.

### Aside: nonlinearity sucks

Some have asked why we need to up the gas costs linearly and why we can't either have a quadratic cost (pay N^2 for N calls) or just a hard limit on the number of calls and suicides per transaction. The answer is that this is a very bad idea that opens up new classes of attacks that contract developers now have to worry about. For example, there may be a parallel to the call stack depth limit attack (which BTW thanks to the 63/64 rule in EIP150 will no longer be a concern) where an attacker makes 99 calls, then makes the last call to the victim contract, and the victim contract fails in some unexpected way.

Memory already has a quadratic gas cost, and this has already annoyed us because it means that there is no way to budget a fixed amount of gas in order to expand memory by a fixed amount. So we're actually trying to move **away** from having a host of weird hard or nonlinear limits that make reasoning about contract development hard.",92.0,2016-10-16 00:28:52,0.93
"I've made a list of contracts which will be 100% broken after the hardfork. There is a balance in some of them, you can verify it yourself.","Some issues with proposed hard fork:

https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/57n2ql/why_i_believe_the_eip150_hardfork_may_break/ 

One of the responses of core developer:

> In the former case, the call will fail with out-of-gas immediately. In the latter case, no change will be made. The EIP will never send more gas than specified to the callee.

It means every contract which uses CALL with less than 700 gas will be broken. Now take this list:

http://pastebin.com/5swFBy6h

And look at disassembled code of any account, for example this one with 0.03 ether:

https://etherchain.org/account/0x08a0d8bf5c40e95065c83211bb6a6b1a4dea9246#codeDisasm

Now search for ""CALL"". If there is a ""PUSH"" just before look at a value - contract will be unusable if value is lower than 700 (0x2bc in hex). 

I've made this list by very simple static analysis, 30 minutes of work. Contracts are dynamic, gas can be pushed by other instruction like ADD, SUB etc. so amount of broken contracts is much bigger for sure, and because there are also other problems I linked to. 

Did developers take an effort to check it?",36.0,2016-10-15 23:31:29,0.68

Why I believe the EIP150 hardfork may break existing contracts,"It was a stressful week... Today I've had some time to review EIP150 proposition:

https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/150

Besides higher price of a few opcodes it changes a mechanism of a gas cost calculation for a call instruction:

>The EIP 90 gas mechanic is introduced because without it, all current contracts that make calls would stop working as they use an expression like msg.gas - 40 to determine how much gas to make a call with, relying on the gas cost of calls being 40.

I assume that it means in a new version of consensus every contract which calls other with not sufficient gas use all available gas instead. I saw a lot of topics about failing transactions because of ""out of gas"" error so I decided to research it a bit deeper. I do not code in go/rust so I took a yellow paper: 

http://gavwood.com/Paper.pdf

There are two essential parts about gas errors/refunds:

> Just as with contract creation, if the execution halts in an exceptional fashion (i.e. due to an exhausted gas supply, stack underflow, invalid jump destination or invalid instruction), then no gas is refunded to the caller and the state is reverted to the point immediately prior to balance transfer 

And

> This states that the execution is in an exceptional halting state if there is insufficient gas, if the instruction is invalid (and therefore its δ subscript is undefined), if there are insufficient stack items, if a JUMP/JUMPI destination is invalid or the new stack size would be larger then 1024.

So we have six cases when contract can fail consuming all available gas. I believe that a new gas calculation mechanism may cause problems because of the way how exception handling is implemented.

* Invalid jump destination - high risk issue

Solidity compiles throw to an invalid JUMP, so there are plenty of contracts which raise such exception, for example every capped crowdsale when a cap is reached use throw to not accept more ether.

What if contract calls a contract which raises an invalid jump exception? If all available gas was sent, then it stops execution. If after failed call there was a withdrawal logic, then it locks money forever.


* Exhausted gas supply - medium risk issue

According to EIP150 consensus rules CALL instruction costs 700 gas. Existing contract can execute this instruction with, for instance, 1000 gas. The called contract needs 500 gas to complete execution, but it won't because there is only 300 gas left (CALL consumed 700 from 1000). It can influence a logic of a calling contract and as a result lock funds in a worst case.


* Stack size, invalid instruction and the rest - low risk issue

I'm sure it is possible to create a contract which works now but won't work after the hardfork because of the stack size and other errors. Nonetheless don't believe there are such now on a blockchain. Even if, they deserve to be spoiled :)


I think there is a simple solution for the ""jump destination"" issue - this exception shouldn't consume all gas and ""throw"" in solidity should be replaced by something else, for example jumping to invalid instruction. 

I don't know what to do with a second one and I believe it can be quite serious too. Third one is a more theoretical issue.

I will support EIP150 with my small scale mining operation with some doubts I've written about, because there is no other proposition and network must be fixed. I don't agree that it must be fixed ASAP at any cost - there is a broad agreement in the community that it must be done quickly, but rushing is more controversial.  


To sum up - I don't think that a risk of ""Cannot access my ether"" topics flood is high, but from my point of view even one such reasonable topic is more damaging than some delay in hard forking a network. ",70.0,2016-10-15 17:25:16,0.82

We should create a set of guidance that defines a minimum viable standard for any ICO:,"I happened to be around in the early days of bitcoin. At that time the concept of a crowdsale (""IPO"") was rather novel. There were many of them. Highlights included coloured coin based bitcoin ""upgrades"", such as mastercoin and counterparty, but there were also mining operations and ASIC manufacturers.
 Tremendous tales of malfeasance and disappearing acts. Countless others that i now forget. For every legitimate idea, a whole bunch of scams. Eventually, we reached the point where the whole concept sort of fell apart in bitcoin-land. It just became impossible to trust anything.

One observation is that the difference between those bitcoin IPOs and ethereum's is that, for the latter, these are basically baked into the concept of the ecosystem - its raison d'etre, whereas in the former, the IPOs are always on the margins, separate from the core technology. This suggests to me that the future of decentralized, crowd-funded ethereum dApps ideas is brighter. But, we should learn the lessons from the early bitcoin days.

On the other hand, my concern is that the success or failure of ethereum is now becoming intimately tied to the future of these eth based dApps. The DAO is the obvious example. Without the promise of decentralized contracts bearing fruit, ethereum becomes just another alt-coin and with every failure people stop taking risks. To the extent possible, we want to encourage rational investment, and prevent irrational gambling..

Perusing any of those ICO countdown sites sets alarm bells ringing. 

What i think we need to do is set a minimum viable community standard. It needs to be made clear that in no way is this to judge either the potential of the idea itself, nor the likelihood of a profitable return, but instead just sets a bar at which such determinations are feasible, from the independent investors perspective. The minimum due diligence. 

It would be interesting to hear general thoughts on this. Possible parameters for inclusion into a specification include:

* A reasonable outline for the project.  
i) A minimum viable working product: core features.  
ii) Development milestones.  
iii) Presentations, FAQ's and question answer sessions.
* Verified information as to the principal architects and team.
* A clear structure for any initial offering  
i) Minimum and maximum funding limits  
ii) Detailed plans for how the monies, at both ends of the spectrum, are to be spent.  
iii) Company and shareholding structures.  
* ICO contract code, written, reviewed and audited, at least X weeks/months before any planned launch.  
* A wind-down plan: lets face it, some of these ICO simply won't work out, and if stated targets and goals are not met for X quarters: how remaining funds will be redistributed to shareholders.

I guess the medium term goal here is to set up some kind of community based ICO 'initial verification' committee.

Thoughts on our values as a community.,"This is something that's been on my mind for a while and I'm going to attempt to codify it in words.  Let's see how this goes.

Managing the culture of a community is difficult.  Being intentional about that culture requires indoctrinating new members to the values that the community holds and somehow convincing those people to subsequently assist in the indoctrination of those that join after them.  Top down enforcement *can* work in some cases but in general I've personally found that the strongest communities are those whose members voluntarily help enforce and spread cultural values.

When I talk about the Ethereum community I am really talking about a difficult to define group of people.  The best definition I've come up with is that these people are both building on the platform and take some part in the ongoing conversation about where it is going.  A better definition is that [I know it when I see it](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I_know_it_when_I_see_it).

So what is our culture and what do we value?  

> What follows is my best stab at defining something that is both inherently hard to define, and has not single *true* definition because we all clearly have different goals, backgrounds, communication styles, etc..  I will be using the sentence ""We ..."" a lot and I want to be sure everyone knows that I'm not trying to speak for *everyone* here, nor do I claim to have a monopoly on truth.  These are things that I've observed about the core of this community.

## Constructive Conversation

We value communication that fosters constructive discourse on whatever the topic may be.  This means we welcome talking about problems and controversial issues, but only if the conversation is constructive.  For me this means that when we talk about problems we are talking about them to either understand them better or find solutions to them.

One of the ways in which this is best demonstrated is that when engaging in a debate with someone, rather than jumping right into refuting your opponent's *wrongness* you first verify that you have indeed correctly understood their position.

One good litmus test for this is asking ""What information would you need to be shown to change your mind?"".  Inability to answer this question is a good indication that the person you are engaging with is not actually wanting to engage in a discussion.


## Minimal Rhetoric

We don't support communication that is heavy on rhetoric or other *low* methods of presenting an argument.  This means that when you have something to say you back it up with verifiable facts and sources rather than things like colorful speech, ad hominem attacks, or appeals to authority.


## No Negativity

We don't celebrate the failures of others.  [This clip from The Newsroom](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZmlizjYqcEQ) sums up my thoughts on this pretty clearly.  Other people's failures don't make us any better.  Similarly, the toxicity of other communities doesn't make our community any better.

This doesn't mean we can't talk about these things, but it does mean that when you do talk about them, you should have something more to say than merely pointing out the deficiencies you see elsewhere.


## Respec, Kindness and Level-headedness

We care about treating each other with respect and kindness.  We are slow to assume malice and give people the benefit of the doubt.  This means we don't engage in name-calling or really any aggressive or abusive behavior.  Phrases like ""You must be stupid if you don't think X"" are not welcome.

[Hanlon's Razor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanlon%27s_razor) is possibly my favorite encapsulation of this idea of assuming the best in people until real evidence to the contrary is found.


## Information Symmetry and Win-Win business relationships.

This one is particularly interesting in that it is not very common in the business world.  This community seems to have silently agreed that we strongly favor openness in our relationships so that neither party has privileged information that gives them an advantage over the other in their decision making.  Another way to put this is that we search for relationships where we have clearly aligned incentives.


## We are not at war

We are not trying to destroy anyone or anything.There's been some recent rhetoric about there being a ""war"" going on and in small ways they may be right, but ultimately we are builders and creators.  In the sense that we currently in the midst of a *battle* of sorts with some unknown party who is DOSing the network, so yes, there are battles, but we, the Ethereum community are not at *war* with anyone.


# Neat, but what are we supposed to do with this.....

If you agree with the sentiment expressed here there are a few things you can do to help continue to grow this community in this direction.


## 1. Don't engage

Be selective about who you engage with.  [XKCD 386](https://xkcd.com/386/) comes to mind.  It's tempting to argue with people.  Instead of just responding to something *wrong*, consider checking their comment history.  Check to see whether they have a history of engaging in productive discussions.


## 2. Use downvotes

Downvote comments and posts which don't conform to the standards you believe in.  This explicitely **DOES NOT** mean things you disagree with.

If something is especially bad, use the *report* button to flag it for moderation.


## 3. Get back to work

We're all working on what can be loosely identified as a revolution.  (My goals are for it to be the non-violent kind).  This isn't going to happen overnight, and it isn't going to happen on it's own.  Ask yourself whether you're actually contributing something of value to the collective discussion.  My personal litmus test is to ask myself *""What are you trying to accomplish with this comment/post""*.  Lots of the time I find I'm just trying to prove someone wrong and close the window and walk away.

Now go build something...

Golem - Draft Crowdfunding Whitepaper,"Today we are pleased to announce the draft release of the Golem crowdfunding whitepaper, available to download [here](http://golemproject.net/doc/DraftGolemProjectWhitepaper.pdf).

To those anticipating our position, yes we will have a cap for this crowdfunding — $10M USD — and we are all too aware of our responsibility to deliver value to the community, whether we reach it or not. Golem lives on the technological frontier, with not only vast R&D ahead of us, but unknown unknowns as well. In other words, we do not yet know all the risks, but we feel that this is a reasonable cap, given the state of the project, the plan ahead, and the current situation within the Ethereum community. We also echo Vitalik’s call to not create smart contracts holding more than $10M, not just on purely technological grounds (security), but also because of wider community considerations: We ourselves have no wish to take in anything more than we believe we can put to use, and we certainly don’t wish to exhaust the pool of ETH available to other important projects.

The good news is that Golem has already reached an advanced proof-of-concept stage, and we believe that we have sufficiently proven that it can be taken much further. Indeed, our vision is much broader than our PoC may suggest: “Airbnb for computers” is an accurate description, but it is also oversimplified. Golem will change how the Internet is organized by introducing a nearly-complete information market for computing power, combined with a market within which developers can monetize their code.

Golem is possible thanks to bleeding-edge technology, but its true potential derives from the impact it will have on economic processes running beneath the surface.

"Great job on Devcon2! But for Devcon3, lets go home!!🇨🇦","I would like to congratulate the Ethereum Foundation on a wonderfully planned and executed Devcon2. I built infrastructure projects in China and I can attest that doing business there is 'not for the faint of heart'. It's tough to execute in that country and Devcon2 went off very smoothly in spite of the attacks on the morning of the opening day and the Foundation Devs even managed to ship a patch from behind the Great Firewall on day 1! I think we all understand deeply that China is where the future of Blockchain will unfold and there is tremendous excitement regarding the potential for Ethereum in China, which was exemplified by the foresight to hold Devcon there. I would have liked to see Vitalik test his very solid Mandarin in front of the packed audience, but that's ok. This kind of leadership and execution is just one more example of why Ethereum is the clear winner in the public blockchain race.

HOWEVER, for next year...Lets go home!!! Ethereum is Canadian! It was created by Canadians IN Toronto and as a Canadian I would like us to recognize this, at least once. It's the most significant Canadian innovation in a generation (yes, that includes you Blackberry and Nortel) and I think it's relevant that we celebrate this fact both for the Ethereum community and for Canada. 

We could also make an argument that BTCMiami was the genesis moment and I will certainly never forget that event because of Ethereum (as well as the crazy fun had on that fateful weekend) so I would be fine going back there as a second option.

However....more arguments for Toronto:
ConsenSys has a BIG Canadian contingent and it would be easier for them since they make up ~20% of the participants. I wouldn't be surprised if Joe Lubin dropped nearly USD1 million to bring out his 100+ (very smart and talented) ConsenSys disciples to Shanghai and then off Bali. He does enough for this community so let's give him a break on that travel bill. 

Toronto is an awesome cosmopolitan city that is easy to get to and accessible/cheap for most European and American community members. I suspect we clear 3500 attendees if we go there.

If we can organize the event for Toronto, as my contribution I will sponsor an open-bar night on one of the nights for Devcon participants at Baro, which is Toronto's newest hotspot. I promise you won't regret it. Yes, that's free drinks on me all night. 

Also, next year the Ethereum Foundation should license the rights to sell swag to a competent, interested third party. I liked the unicorn t-shirts and all. But frankly speaking, there is a lot more that can be done with this brand.",63.0,2016-10-14 01:29:37,0.89
Why DwarfPool mines mostly empty blocks and only few ones with transactions,"On the one hand, as one of large pools we support etherum-network and always up-to-date if any problems occur. On the other hand, we are responsible for our miners.

1) We are in direct contact with ethcore developers, our pool tests the first critical patches, we find bugs, analyze network and protocol.
We have a large network of servers worldwide and can analyze issues from many points.

2) Current attack is very hard. This type of attack makes impossible to mine ""normal/usual"" blocks.
Blocks with spam-contracts are generated with delay, usually with 2-10 seconds delay behind the empty blocks.
In this situation found blocks will be uncle mostly, and transactions will be also lost.
Difference between uncle and full reward is more than 1.25ETH, so if we'd enable our whole hashpower to mine transactions, up to 100% blocks might be uncles (in reality ca.40-60%) and miners would lost up to 50% of their earnings.

We have a lot of servers (currently 42 nodes), both small and very big. During the problem with memory leak in parity, I configured the power servers to mine blocks with transactions, and small ones - without them.
Now, after the second wave of spam today, big servers mine that comes first, sometimes that is an empty block, or rarely - with transactions.
Majority of transaction in a queue belongs to attacker. he pays much more fee than users, to get included his transactions in blockchain, which destroy ethereum network.

3) In this sutuation only a quick HF is the solution to settle ethereum network. Actually normal transaction are unstable and are often kicked by both clients geth and parity.

As a temporary possible solution might be a client for miners only, that filters the spam-transactions before to include them into a new block.

On Gas Price Markets,"In response to the [set of gas price changes](http://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/150) proposed in EIP 150 to remedy recent denial-of-service issues, a number of commenters have asked: rather than tweaking gas prices manually, is there not some more general mechanism that could be introduced that could adjust gas prices automatically? EIP 150 is a response to the fact that hard drive access as a category is currently underpriced, but as technology inevitably changes it may well be the case that in the future other imbalances will emerge. What if, ten years from now, bandwidth improves by 50x but computing only improves by 5x? What if hard disk storage space ends up costing almost nothing? What if the virtual machine becomes highly optimized, but calling continues to be as inefficient as it is today?

There are several categories of solutions that have been considered, including:

* **Miner voting** - allow miners to vote on the price of each individual opcode
* **Market-based schemes** - allow transactions to specify what gas schedule they execute with, and allow miners to choose what gas schedules they accept
* **Timing games** - come up with an in-protocol challenge-response algorithm to encourage transaction senders to find transactions that take a long time to process, and use this information to determine which opcodes need to be made more expensive

These solutions have also been explored since at least 2014 in a different context - namely, automatically lowering gas prices for precompile contracts that all client implementations have optimized. In that case, all such approaches were ultimately abandoned, the primary argument being that the scheme would be too easy to exploit: a malicious actor could come up with a contract that could under normal circumstances be executed quickly, but which had a few ""worst-case inputs"" known only to the attacker where all optimizations are impossible. Coming up with such a contract and getting it accepted as a gas-discounted precompile would lead quickly to a denial-of-service opportunity. Another category of exploit is in creating a contract which an attacker could execute quickly, but all others could not; this was the Achilles' heel of all timing-based approaches. Hence, the present status quo, where new precompiles can only be added via hardfork, was the only feasible option.

In the context of opcodes, many of those arguments do not apply. No one has the ability to ""create their own"" opcode; all that we have are the opcodes that are included as part of the protocol, and so it seems much less likely that an attacker could discover some hidden edge case or trapdoor for them. Thus, a dynamic gas pricing scheme is in fact much more likely to be successful. However, even still a number of additional concerns remain.

* **Secondary purposes of a gas limit** - many gas pricing proposals have in mind a notion that the gas limit is only about limiting block processing time. However, the gas schedule also serves other important purposes; a particularly important one is limiting the growth of the state size, and in the future limiting the size of the Merkle proof needed to show validity of a block. Allowing miners full freedom in choosing the gas schedule would lead to such concerns being neglected since individual miners have no incentive to pay attention to them due to the [tragedy-of-the-commons problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tragedy_of_the_commons).
* **The global block gas limit** - there is a global block gas limit, and it is an intention of this limit that it actually places a hard cap on the total quantity of computational and other resources that need to be consumed in the process of verifying the block. However, if miners can somehow accept gas schedules where _every_ opcode is much cheaper, then this creates an opportunity to circumvent this limit.
* **Loss of guarantees** - it is considered desirable to try to avoid adjusting gas costs _upwards_ if at all possible, as such an action could break any calls that are made with a static amount of gas. Fortunately, today almost all calls simply pass all the gas to the callee, but in the future (eg. if total-functional high-level languages become popular) this may change.

However, there is one ""partial path"" that can get us quite far: segregate gas costs by category. That is, instead of having a single gas cost that covers everything, we can have several categories of gas cost, representing:

* Computation time
* Size of the Merkle proof for the block
* Bytes added to history
* Bytes added to state
* Polluting the bloom filter
* Transaction data / bandwidth

There have already [been](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/35) [proposals](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/87) for separating out storage costs with a ""storage rent"" scheme. But we can theoretically go further. One other very cleanly divisible change that could follow is a separate gas cost schedule for computation and for transaction data, so users would specify a gas price per execution-time gas and a gas price per byte. Transaction data is paid for only at the top level of execution, and miners have just as much of a disincentive to create data-heavy blocks as they do computation-heavy blocks, so none of the above objections would apply.

It could be possible to create a gas schedule for opcodes that enforces a minimum gas price to pay for history, state and Merkle proof bloat, and allow a dynamic scheme to handle the execution time component. In essence, we would rely on the uncle rate disincentive (the fact that computation or data-heavy blocks are more likely to become uncles, and so miners themselves have an incentive to avoid including too much of either) to guide gas costs for computation and data, and have other stricter formulas to limit the other dimensions of resource consumption that miners have no private incentive to control.

Coming up with such models is still a research topic; it's not reasonable to expect something like this to be researched and reviewed in time for the EIP150 hard fork, and so in the short term ""Starcraft-style rebalancing"" is the only realistic way forward. In the longer term, there certainly are ways that the gas schedule can be made much more flexible.",166.0,2016-10-12 05:44:13,0.89

GRAVITY: A Decentralized Competitive Software Development Platform on Solidity.,"GRAVITY: Decentralized competitive software development platform on solidity.
(Decentralized Topcoder.com + Codecademy for Solidity)
The major purpose of this document is to give you all a clear picture of the idea and get your valuable feedback .

Who am I ?

I am Madangopal Kaveripakkam, graduated as a mechanical engineer. I have spent most of my career in start-ups.My skills include sales, marketing , operations and product management. In 2012, I founded 3rdDhaba.com a start-up that delivers from restaurants in the city to suburbs, smaller towns, and residential campuses. I sold it off in 2014 and moved to Canada, to explore and venture into blockchain and cryptocurrency.

Why am I doing this and why I believe it's important?

I am doing this for three reasons, firstly, on the ethereum platform, most players are hackers who have spent significant time in the crypto space. While there's is currently no platform that could help newbies like me to make the transition to Start coding and writing smart contracts on solidity. I want to make learning this technology an easier process for everyone. I wish there were a codecademy and topcoder for solidity.
Secondly, As a go-to market guy, I want to push the boundaries of decentralized software development, where D-Apps themselves can be developed and launched in a decentralized way.
Thirdly, I missed my shot at the internet revolution, it's my chance to be a part of the crypto revolution.

The Problem
The gap that exists in Solidity knowledge and implementation?

I want to learn to build Dapps , I haven’t coded before I want to learn and practice where do I start?

The gap that exists for product creators to execute dapp ideas

I have this really cool dapp idea but where can find developers?

The gap in communication between client and developer?

“I say one thing the developer delivers something else”

The gap that exists in paying the right amount for development work
Client: How do I trust a freelancer with his price?
 Developer: How can I get paid the right price from my client?

The gap that exists in sharing company stock and revenue with early stakeholders

“I want to code for as many startups and get a few early bird shares”

How the community can encourage new members and give them an equal opportunity.
“Let’s build as many apps for the people of our cause, let’s not worry about money here, let’s learn, build, provide more opportunities and create more companies from ideas”

Solidity our digital language of the future.

With ethereum, we are looking at a future were kids , lawyers, doctors or every third person will need to understand and speak solidity.

Gravity is a completely crowdsourced dapp development platform through competitions on ethereum.It aims to encourage users to learn solidity ,code for D-Apps,and get hired. would be an I integration of Codecademy+ top coder+ HackerRank.

How does it work?

It's pretty simple, a dapp company or an individual post the requirements of their dapp idea and the deliverables. The dapp would pledge a certain percentage of their tokens to the community and the platform will hold X% of tokens pledged .

Initially,The platform will distribute the idea to different key members of the community who would break down the problem for Gravity tokens, and create the architecture for software development, then further different members would break down these into smaller problems that users would code in a system generated competition.

Once the platform has reached a critical mass of users, it would automatically hold competitions for architecture, algorithm, development design, testing and for various other elements of the software development process and eventually eliminate the need for key members.

The platform will automatically process the fastest programs and combine different parts to deliver the final product to the client.

Eg:  The overall solution is combination of 4 problems A,B,C,D
The software will put together the fastest solution of A,B,C,D and put it together or organize another competition to assemble the parts.

What the ethereum virtual machine will do?

Each problem in a competition has a set value assigned to it in Gravity tokens, so every time a participant solves a problem he would receive the value assigned to it through a smart contract.
 
Participants can earn tokens by also challenging other participants’ solution and earn twice the bet, or lose the bet. Hence transfer of value from one participant to another

Also, the division of tokens can be easily divided among the developers involved in a project.

The various smart contracts will be between the following:

 Companies and Gravity: To share a % of their dapp tokens with Gravity and its stakeholders

Players and Gravity : Gravity will reward its token for early participants based on their contribution to the community.

Company and players : Various startups will share their tokens among winners of different competitions and reward coders  who provide great pieces of a code irrespective of their final victory in a competition.

A contract between players for team events: In certain competitions where members need to form teams Gravity tokens can be shared among team members.

Smart contract between Gravity and other Dapps: When the community grows larger the companies can hire talent and instantly share revenue with Gravity 

How do the competitions work?

The idea is very similar to top coder.com, the major difference is top coder doesn’t share how much their Fortune 1000 clientele pays them for solving their problems but gets the code done almost free through competitions, and we want to decentralize that completely. Here we want to create the same community of coders like topcoder.com, while making use of the ethereum ecosystem to share revenue among different players ,at the same time we would want coders to get the high of developing new ideas for the community without actually being tied to a particular idea.

Step1:The idea person will submit the complete idea requirements final design, wireframes etc.
Step 2 :Members  would break down the complex problem and submit smaller problems for the competition.
Step 3:The competition dates are announced and participants fight and the best codes for each problem is put together and tested.

PRACTICE ROOMS (codecademy)

This would be the most crucial aspect of Gravity , this is the place where people will learn and hone their skills. This is where newbies get tested and rated for their skills and get ready for higher challenges in the competition. The practice will be gamified and make learning code extremely fun.

Revenue Model

There are two major sources of revenue streams, first from companies sponsoring various competitions or posting problems, the secondly is from companies hiring key talent. Gravity expects to create more new startups in the sector and will hold certain minimum percentages of the startups.

Hirers

Gravity hopes to sell its plugin to various companies, who wish to recruit solidity developers. Candidates can take placement tests directly from the company website. Hirers can customize the difficulty levels of tests according to their requirements.

Investors

Investors will majorly include members who invest in Gravity, invest in competitions for certain competitions thereby increasing the prize money, all investors will get a certain share of Gravity tokens based on the exchange rate.

I hope this gives you all an overall picture of what I want to create. Looking forward to your feedback and suggestions. I apologize for my not so great English. If you find my idea interesting and want to be a part of it feel free to mail me at madangopal.kaveripakkam@gmail.com

"Coins on-top of Ethereum have a role to play, but they should not be center stage for the platform and may be a dirty stain against us","I've noticed that a lot of projects are now raising money in the form of ICO's and sometimes these projects really do not need to be using their own economic token.

*I will not name any names or projects as I prefer to keep this discussion on a conceptual level so that we can argue the fundamentals.*

Here are my thoughts on the issue, feel free to discuss and disagree. I welcome any discourse.

* **I am not saying that all projects do not need an ICO, some actually need their own token.**
* Does the project really need an economic token? What is it's purpose?
* I've heard some people apart of these projects actually say that is the purpose of Ethereum, to run tokens as the main economic transaction. I do not agree.
* Any economic token automatically has hundreds of times if not thousands of times less acceptance than Ether. This means that by using your own coin/token **when you do not need** to automatically reduces the chances of your projects success.
* **when you do not need** -> Can the project actually exist and work with Ether alone? The uncomfortable truth is that I believe so.
* However instead of a bunch of nerds and investors discussing a *just world* let's focus on the cold hard reality, **Market forces**.
* **Market forces** -> If a project can be run on top of Ether direct, with it's much larger acceptance and continued growth as a crypto currency posed to take on Bitcoin, then a clone removing the economic token will persist.
* Of course ***how do the project creators make their money?*** I believe that the answer to this is something closer to kick-starter than an ICO.
* The good news is that kick starter type projects can raise money on the blockchain using Ether without ever needing to make another token/coin.
* I propose that projects that want/need money raise it in stages via kick starter like fund raisers.
* Imagine a stage one fund raiser. The projects asks for X ETH and once they get it they release part of the project. If they don't get it they do not release the project.
* To build another part of the project they can make a second fund raiser etc..... the community can even choose to build the next part of the project themselves or use another team, then the project forks into two competing systems that both use Ether. Even better if the projects are making a protocol for a task, then everyone wins. The original team get their payout via a fund raiser and there are no tokens laying around driving the project into the ground.
* Because we do need to reward people for their DAPPS, but at the same time they may not need a special token that in the end will just fail.
* **No one will buy hundreds of different tokens** for the web 3.0.
* The Ethereum community can get behind Ether being the liquid currency for all web 3.0 applications and make it as strong as the USD, the de facto currency for the web, or we can fragment the project into a stupid number of currencies for every project.
* One of the beautiful things about this is that no matter what I say, no matter what you say, and no matter what these projects say, if the market favors a web 3.0 built around Ether and not hundreds of tokens, it's just going to happen. Of course it requires raising awareness of other ways to raise money so that we can **still attract developers* to Ethereum.
* The issue here isn't always about the money being raised, because for ***some*** projects they are going to need funds and a reward to develop Ether tech (as I am calling it) but the issue is that tying some part of the project down to it's own token actually retards the projects and limits its appeal. See (1) and (2):
* **(1)** Instead of being available the whole Ethereum community that is growing rapidly, the project is only usable by a small minority using an unnecessary token **OR**
* **(2)** The project is available some way to the Ethereum community using Ether but it's a little more expensive as it's powered by it's own token in an unnecessary way, this also limits it's potential growth.
* On the topic of a dirty stain, let's face it a lot of ICO's are all pumping and dumping or just being greedy especially when you can easily see ways to achieve their results without their own tokens. That means that Ethereum is being associated with lots of pump and dumps and not really trying to change the world.
* One issue that a lot of people point out is that Ether (ETH) is not a store of value, it's just for gas. See below:
* Without Ether being a store of value, good luck securing the network with PoS. I believe the Ethereum foundation is doing a complete 180 with this. On one hand they are saying that Ether is not to be an asset or store of value whilst on the other hand saying that it's:
* (A) powering the new web 3.0.
* (B) will be using as security for PoS.
* (C) if Ether is really just gas, make it gas then not Ether.
* (D) the Ethereum developers including Vitalik have advised and invested in various ICO's where the primary transfer of value for the ICO is **Ether**. Funny that the foundation says Ether is not for holding value yet the very Foundation members are using it as a store of value.
* Therefore I argue that let's once and for all put an **end** to this argument that Ether is only for gas. That is rubbish. It ismost certainly a liquid store of value and I believe that within the next 5 years I will be able to buy a coffee at my local coffee shop using Ether. We can either **embrace** this and grow or run away from it and let the next Ethereum competitor actually get it's act together, compete with Bitcoin and push Ethereum into an early grave.

We really need to be better prepared in order to keep out these low quality ICOs.

Decentralized Capital’s Membership Sale: Alternative to the ICOverload (comment inside for your chance at a free membership),"https://medium.com/@alexwearn/decentralized-capitals-membership-sale-alternative-to-the-icoverload-2df7bd5bad41#.vexq81p7x

**TL;DR:** DC is excited to announce the sale of DC memberships. The DC membership (DVIP) is an ERC20 token that entitles the holder to discounts on DC services. These tokens act as a pre-paid membership, providing benefits, such as ZERO transaction fees on all on-chain transfers, from the time they are purchased through the beginning of 2020. 2000 memberships will go on sale to the general public on Oct 24th at a price of $300 per membership.

**Membership Giveaway:** We'll be giving away 5 DVIP to the reddit community. To enter you must reply to the [comment below](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/56rwup/decentralized_capitals_membership_sale/d8lt56c) in this thread with your Ethereum address (please don't put your address elsewhere, we'd like for actual discussion to rise to the top). Five winners will be selected at random after 24 hours. Accounts must be more than one week old to be eligible.

**Early buy in:** To ensure that our loyal customers have a chance to purchase, we are allowing interested parties to buy one membership prior to the general sale. Please message our reddit account, u/decentralizedcapital, for more details. All customer accounts must have existed prior to the announcement of the sale, and have some post/comment history in the Ethereum subreddits.

**Generating Liquidity:** DC Assets have a huge network effect component; a large portion of the value of the service is derived from the fact that others are also using it, and no one wants to be the first guy to the party. We’ve talked with multiple exchanges who are interested in listing DC Assets, however they need to see demonstrative evidence that there is sufficient demand and liquidity.

In order to overcome this problem, one sixth of the revenue (100K) will be dedicated to market making on exchanges, helping seed the order book with DC Assets. Using BTC to facilitate these transactions will allow us to build up volume very quickly. Assuming a 1% round-trip cost for fees, these efforts will generate up to $10M in DC Asset liquidity (the 1% fee is analogous to the reserve requirement in the [money multiplier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Money_multiplier) formula).

**Contracts:** All of our contracts are [opensource](https://github.com/decentralizedcapital/dcasset), including DVIP, if you'd like to take a closer look at how we're implementing this from a technical perspective.

**Questions**: Please put your questions/comments below, or join our slack (link at the footer of our [homepage](https://www.decentralizedcapital.com)) for more info.",20.0,2016-10-10 13:19:41,0.83
I built a new Dapp. Ethereum + Quora + Reddit + Steemit. Introducing WEIWARDit. A blockchain based social platform that rewards you Ether for your answers.,"Hi all,

I would like to put forward to the community a new Dapp that I have been working on. Essentially, it is Quora + Reddit, with Ethereum built right into it.

The name of the platform is WEIWARDit. The name is a play on the words WEI (the smallest unit of Ether) and 'reward/reddit'.

http://www.weiwardit.com

The platform allows users to ask questions, and the community to reward answers with tips in units of Ether. 

The platform can be used as a way to find answers. It can be used as a form of income for others. The smallest tip amount is 1 WEI + gas. There is no maximum tip amount.

Answers to questions can be rewarded an Ether tip. This allows people to respond to questions posed on the platform and be paid Ether for their response.

The basic idea of the platform, is that sometimes it can be hard to find the answer to a question through the typical channels online. Perhaps you need the answer quickly, perhaps you need an answer pertaining to a very particular subject. Perhaps the only way to get a (good) answer is to incentivize it. 

WEIWARDit enables the people asking questions (and community at large) to reward answers in the form of Ether units. It also allows the people that are answering the questions to immediately withdraw the Ether tips they have received for answering questions.

Currently, the platform only exists on Morden testnet. There is no real Ether being exchanged. This is a pre-alpha release and as such, there is still a lot of work to do. 

What I did want to do was just announce WEIWARDit to the community, and to begin a feedback loop on what you think of the platform, what features you would like to see added etc and so-forth.

I also need to just disclaim that this project is not entirely an exercise in decentralization. The core of the platform runs off mySQL DB (posts, comments). The financial layer of the platform is running entirely on the Ethereum protocol via a simple smart-contract.

I have been in talks with various members of the Ethereum developer community, in regards to safety of the smart contract and I have only had good feedback so far. A lot of lessons have been learnt since the DAO.

I would also like to mention, that you are free to join now on the testnet version at http://weiwardit.com but please, be aware that this is only a pre-alpha release and as such any accounts that you create may not make it to the alpha release. This release is in no way meant to be a complete platform, and in fact is only a MVP.

I would hope to hear feedback from the community here at r/ethereum. Good or bad, all is welcome and will be taken on board for the alpha release and eventual ICO (details to be confirmed).

You can follow the progress on [twitter](http://www.twitter.com/weiwardit) or PM me your email and/or comment below to show your interest in receiving future updates.

Also, only registered users can ask a question, reply, upvote. However, anybody can tip any answer, a user just needs to be synced to Morden in order to send a tip, as per the 'About' page.

I also just want to re-iterate that this is only a pre-alpha release version running on Morden testnet only. No real Ether is at stake. Feel free to use the platform to ask for testnet Ether as a test etc etc. Please also try to break it. There are a few issues which I am familar with, which are still work in progress. Tagging of posts is also yet to be added.

I want to stress, this is all a work in progress, but progress towards hopefully what can be a useful tool, built on top of the Ethereum protocol.

"SingularDTV, Augur and the rest coming....","I would like to share some of my personal experience and observation from the past days/weeks.

Crypto in general and Ethereum in particular are entering a new fase on the path of growth and maturity.

In a short term, might look like a dark coulds are gathering, yet if you could zoom out and try see the long term, grand picture, we might notice something quite remarkable happening...

We are witnessing a tremendous shift.

The arrival of the very first wave of real world applications based and deeply nested in this, in my opinion, paradigm shifting technology (Blockchain, decentralised economy) like SingularDTV, Augur and soon others to follow.

Even from the perspective of managing ones own assets, one could already (me personal experinece) hedge in tokens of projects (after a good research) based on Ethereum.

But much more important, to witness one of the most profound shifts in our life times occuring, right here, right now in front of our eyes.
Also I personally feel priviledged to take even a tiny part of this...even if only in rejoicing in this marvelous happening!

In my eyes this is simply incredible and in a way very humbling experience.

So glad to be having a seat on the front row witnessing this shift occuring.

Simply mind blowing!

[Comment reply](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/56qs2y/what_is_the_consensus_on_the_legality_of_doing_an/d8lphu3?context=3), which really causes more questions than it answers. I outright reject the notion that there's two versions being developed, one [on github](https://github.com/ether-camp/virtual-accelerator/) which contains a smattering of small changes, and one in private which will need to be rebased to contain these changes. It's not mentioned anywhere that development is happening in private, at least as far as I can see. Is <10 days *really* enough lead time for this to be audited before it receives money?

"Why The DAO was actually a good idea (if capped), and would be a great way to fund ICOs on a smaller scale.","Because proposals needed a breakdown of where the funds would go, and the control of the funds was in the investors hands. There was more due diligence being done, and there was room for negotiation if we did not like a proposal. There was no FOMO because startups needed to prove to the community that they were a good investment first. 

It would be great to see the Ethereum community hold itself to a higher standard by rejecting startups that want to capitalize on unlimited funds by going uncapped (or setting a ridiculously high cap) and trying to capitalize on the FOMO. 

One way to achieve this would be to make using a DAO standard for any ICO and rejecting as a community those that did not, unless they had a really good reason for not doing so. 

Of course the problem is that nobody trust a DAO anymore, but at the very least we should try to adopt the same principles by coming together as a community and outright rejecting ICOs that are uncapped, have a ridiculously high cap, and do not have a clear financial breakdown.

 ""The website www.bitcoinat.co.uk caught my attention as they claim to exchange bitcoin/eth/ltc to paypal or skrill instantly. Their ""exchange prices"" on their website, even though they do change a little bit, is certainly ""attractive"" from an exchange point of view - they are 5-10% above the market (with the exception of the UK Pounds prices). Company is registered in the UK, no accounts filed, sole director Miel Ge has correspondence address at the same address as the firm (a red flag). No KYC to send cash to Paypal - another red flag. No payment processing licence in the UK - another red flag. Not listed with the FCA.

Now here is the main concern: If you type in the amount you want to exchange, select paypal and enter your email address, a BTC address pops up with the address to send the BTC to. The address is the same each time - regardless of the email address, amount or anything. In other words there would be no way for bitcoinat.co.uk to differentiate between deposits, if two persons fill in the deposit form, and only one of the two actually sends the 1 BTC, the company has no way to see who of the two who actually sent the BTC. Their BTC address - https://blockchain.info/address/135yzkufEp3KkYdubkdnCEP6KFswyYnSfr fortunately only has a very small deposit on it, so hopefully people are aware of the scam. The LTC and ETH addresses so far has no deposits, but this firm only started advertising on Reddit a few days ago. I would hate for newbies to loose interest in Cyber crypto after being scammed by these people.

Needless to say if the staff at bitcoinat.co.uk can prove otherwise, and that they only have made a very clumsy deposit system (which are doomed to fail) then please go ahead and prove it.

This smells classic fraud a long way if you ask me.""

Today's Blockchain Issues and Parity Fix,"Today, we've seen an sudden increase in the uncle-rates, and a corresponding drop in difficulty, indicating latency or connectivity-problems between nodes. 

The reason this is happening is that the attacker has found an issue with how Parity relays transactions; as it by default does not validate transactions before relaying. 

The attacker is submitting large transactions which are being passed around, even though they are (for the most part) never included into any blocks.

Example of a transaction which actually were included: https://etherscan.io/tx/0xb1d7fbdc4b28c0471ca92d290b4d46f6d2471ee0f7bd1ece2661e57d86cd51eb

Explaining EIP 150,"https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/150 is currently the leading candidate for a hard fork to rebalance gas costs to resolve remaining DoS issues. There are several proposed versions of the change: the most basic one increases the following gas costs:

* EXTCODESIZE to 700
* EXTCODECOPY to 700
* BALANCE to 400
* SLOAD to 200
* CALL, CALLDELEGATE, CALLCODE to 700
* SUICIDE to 5000

This covers all opcodes that access a piece of the state that has not already been accessed before (eg. CODECOPY copies the code  that is currently being called, but that code has already been loaded so it doesn't count). SLOAD gets a 5x cost increase, most other opcodes in the 10-20x range.

This accounts for the fact that IO operations were underpriced in the original gas cost table, with their gas cost not reflecting the high amount of time needed to access the opcodes. SUICIDE gets a uniquely high 5000 gas cost because SUICIDE isn't just a state-reading operation - it's a _state-chaging_ operation. This fork aims to preserve the invariant that all state changes consume at least 5000 gas.

An additional rule is added that if a call tries to ask for too much gas, instead of failing the child simply gets the maximum allowed gas. This is necessary because currently most calls are hardcoded to ask for `msg.gas - 40` gas, and any increase in the gas cost of a call would break every call; this solves that problem.

(1b) adds a rule that the child of a call cannot consume more than 63/64 of the gas of the parent. This has two purposes:

1. Supersede the ""hard limit"" max call stack depth with a softer limit, where creating a deep call tower would require an exponentially growing amount of gas. This completely removes call stack depth limit attacks as a category of issue that contract developers should have to worry about, as well as slightly reducing the risk of future consensus failures due to off-by-one errors.
2. Reduce the maximum de-facto call stack depth to ~300, somewhat alleviating any future clients that end up being vulnerable to quadratic attacks.

Now is arguably a very good time to do this, as both this 63/64 change and the CALL gas cost increase is something that incompatibly changes the experience for developers, and it is better to annoy developers once rather than twice.

(2) changes the gas costs further so that EXTCODESIZE, EXTCODECOPY, CALL, CALLDELEGATE, CALLCODE all cost 4000. However, you are refunded at the end for all gas minus 400 plus one per six bytes in the code. The purpose of this rule is to penalize accessing 18kb contracts even more than accessing small contracts (and in fact even be more lenient than (1) to users who are accessing contracts less than ~2kb in size), as full-sized contracts are an especially severe ddos vector.

With (1) only, DoS issues should be alleviated by ~15-30x. With (2) they may be alleviated by as much as 100x; however, (2) is more complex to code.",189.0,2016-10-08 03:09:22,0.94
Questions about the Ethereum Foundation,"I have a few questions about the Ethereum Foundation.

--------------

1) They do not list developers being paid under their page https://ethereum.org/foundation

I really think that it would be a good idea to show what development teams are being directed and paid by the Foundation.

By doing this it will show that Ethereum has a large development team almost like a professional software company.

I go to this page to get an idea about the scale of the Ethereum development team and I can only count two developers.

(The general public will not browse github for this information.)

--------------

2) How much money is left? I think that should be transparent. Maybe it is but I can't find it.

--------------

3) Raise more money when needed! Eventually the Foundation may need to transparently raise more money, I think that 6 monthly or annual fundraisers like Wikipedia does will be necessary.

I have no problems donating money to a Foundation that needs it. At the moment I can't even tell how much money is left.

--------------

4) The Foundation page is severely lacking in information.

Hard forks are a software upgrade,"Since the DAO there is immense political pressure emanating from Core bitcoin developers and their supporters to try and paint hard forking as an evil thing (spread the 'contentious meme!'). Hence the skulduggery after the previous ethereum hard fork to dredge up ETC. In the end the market chose to follow the developers and community - not really a surprise. It won't be a surprise to me if bitcoin forks in the next year or so, either.

The thing is that a hard fork is simply the network choosing to follow an upgrade path by the ethereum project developers. If you don't want to upgrade then don't. Personally I like technological improvements and I will be supporting any hard forks which improve the network. Be it purely technical upgrades or major changes such as sharding and a move to PoS, if it improves the scalability or resistance to attack then I will support it. 

Ethereum is whatever the community, devs, companies and users want to it to be. If a hard fork is followed then what the network becomes is ethereum. Right now the network is being hardened against attack courtesy of someone unknown. This is great for long term ethereum users and investors (and a short term pain in the neck for ethereum dev's). 

Gaming this out there may be some price volatility going into the next fork, but speculators expecting the rump chain (ETC^2!?) to hold value are going to be very disappointed. The likelihood is that (much like bitcoin) speculators will soon learn that a copy of a network without any users or community is worth 0. ETC will probably disappear under the waves with barely a ripple as this realisation permeates the hivemind (why bother holding etc1 or etc2 or etc3 when eth holds the true speculative value?!).

More interesting is that once ethereum does successfully hard fork again (i prefer ""consensus-based upgrade"") it sets the precedent which shows that value of the ethereum ledger will always follow the community and the developers as long as they are in agreement - putting pay to the idea that we must avoid hard forks at all cost. Pure common sense if you think about it - what the network decides the market should confirm, the essence of a free market - and exactly the opposite of what toxic people in the bitcoin space will sell you. This puts bitcoin in a very precarious position indeed as the clique of core dev's are playing a very different tune to the rest of the ecosystem (I wonder what will happen when bitcoin continues to lose market share and a choice is presented..on chain scaling or keep the network crippled forever..hmm).

"Parity completely destroyed gas price market, network at risk","As a miner and ICO participant I've been following current network problems very closely. During a REP madness network was flooded with many transactions with high gas price and gas limit (people usually set higher than necessary because change is returned). There was a long queue of high priority transactions but blocks contained also cheap ones, it looked like there is a problem with transaction selection. I have found what is responsible for this:

https://github.com/ethcore/parity/commit/c3741640f70aa9e2a1dd85a7db687c45942bf1de#diff-6c58828df7c5a6a2d1da22c859095013R199

Current parity uses the following code for sorting transactions (code commited a few days ago):

    // Then compare gas usage
    let a_gas = self.gas;
    let b_gas = b.gas;
    if a_gas != b_gas {
    	return a_gas.cmp(&b_gas);
    }
    
    // Then compare gas_prices
    let a_gas_price = self.gas_price;
    let b_gas_price = b.gas_price;
    if a_gas_price != b_gas_price {
    	return b_gas_price.cmp(&a_gas_price);
    }

Why the hell gas usage is compared? How it is relevant for a miner? There is no fee market with such ordering. Furthermore it introduces a new attack vector. Basically now it is possible to flood a network with very low gas limit transaction (minimum possible) and even if others pay 1000x more parity doesn't care. Attacker can fill all blocks with such transactions (cheapest possible) any time and nobody will be able to send any transaction.

Also it doesn't help at all:

Update on Geth 1.4.16,"We continue to work on getting the next release ready to go, with changes to resolve the recently identified DoS issues brought to our attention by an anonymous individual.

The DoS issue that began affecting the network yesterday morning has been remediated by adding state journalling to Geth. Journalling means that we no longer need to copy a transaction's state when a call is made; this is the root cause of many of the recently identified issues. Journalling, along with other recent improvements in response to other attacks, should also make Geth significantly faster at importing transactions.

Because this is a significant change to critical code, we're exercising even more than normal caution in getting it ready for release, and are writing additional tests to make absolutely certain it doesn't break anything. This is the main reason for the delay.

In addition, we've been made aware of a second DoS issue revolving around the way the JIT VM preprocesses code, and so the upcoming release will disable the JIT VM. Previously 10% of installations were randomly selected to use the new JIT VM.

"I am an IDIOT, but I've been saved! (a password recovery story)","Storytime - with a happy ending (not that kind of happy ending sicko)

So I started in on Ethereum a little after the pre-sale but just in time to get some coin in on Augur. I'm a designed by trade but not a friend of the command line. I bumbled through creating my first few accounts and when ethereum wallet showed up I imported the keys Augur sent me months and months ago.

I've since used a lot of ethereum, opened trading accounts, bought into the DAO, even got in on that quick af Digix sale, and generally felt pretty comfortable using the tools. I tucked my passwords down into some encrypted notes and have referred to them often without issue.

Then, finally, Augur is ready - I get the test emails and quickly check my account on etherscan, and since I had my password written down - I never bothered actually testing that... yes this is where I became an idiot. Augur REP launched for real and I tried to get it up in MEW... wrong password. I tried every thing I could think of, and every typo combination...wrong password. FUCK. I'm an idiot. I lost a LOT of money.

Then there was hope. I thought maybe I'd missed some configurations of the passphrase I thought it was - and I saw several posts recommending the python recovery tool [pyethrecover](https://github.com/ryepdx/pyethrecover). I'm still a command-line-troglodyte but with the help of a developer friend we tried for 2 hours to get it working. Hope was lost. Error after error the thing wasn't running properly.

Then I was SAVED! This GO tool [ethcracker](https://github.com/lexansoft/ethcracker) was so much easier and more powerful. I had my password in about 15 mins. Sooooooo Stoked.

Community input on new precompiled contract for Zcash Relay,"In an effort to bring the technologies and communities of Zcash and Ethereum together we are building a Zcash relay that will function much like BTCRelay, allowing verification of Zcash transactions on the Ethereum blockchain.

In order to make this system efficient enough for the EVM, we need to introduce a new precompiled contract to compute the BLAKE2b hash function, used in Zcash's proof of work.

There are a few design choices that need to be decided, and community input would be helpful, as in the end this will be implemented in a hard fork (likely the Metropolis upgrade), requiring full community support. 

You can view and comment on the EIP [here](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/129).

One plan is to implement only the most computationally intensive core part of the hash function, allowing other contracts to implement other features like incremental hashing, tree hashing, keyed hashing, etc. In addition to the increased efficiency of a Zcash relay, this would provide several useful features, like the ones mentioned above, to other contracts which do not currently have access to these more sophisticated hashing features.

Let's run on-chain decentralized exchanges the way we run prediction markets,"Alongside some of the other [recent paradigms](http://block.auction/) for decentralized exchanges that we have seen emerge, I thought that I would offer a third alternative. This borrows some ideas from [Nick Johnson's proposal here](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/54l32y/euler_the_simplest_exchange_and_currency/), albeit with many simplifications, and is also very similar to how prediction markets like those in gnosis and augur operate already. 

The main challenge that I see with the MKR market, etherdelta and other markets right now is the high spreads, often 10% or even higher. A large part of this is that market making is very expensive, as creating an order and removing an order both take gas fees, even if the orders are never ""finalized"". State channel-based solutions could theoretically resolve this, but are far from being implemented. My proposed solution is to use the style of ""on-chain automated market maker"" used in prediction markets in a decentralized exchange context.

The mechanism would look something like this. The market contains an internal state, `PRICE`, which is the current market price. It would also have two parameters, `FEE`, and `DEPTH`. If a user wants to buy `ORDER_AMOUNT` coins, they would raise the price to `PRICE + ORDER_AMOUNT / DEPTH`, and pay `ORDER_AMOUNT * (PRICE + ORDER_AMOUNT / DEPTH / 2) * (1 + FEE)`. Essentially, this constitutes buying an infinitesimal number of coins at every price point between the old price and the new price.

Note that this is not risk-free to set up: it requires an initial deposit of both coins and ETH, and if the price jumps around too quickly it could get exploited. One way to reduce the risk is to put orders into a queue for X blocks and while an order is in the queue other users could ""snap up"" the order, offering to pay a more favorable rate than the original offeror; however, this has complexities of its own and could be left to a later version.

Users have the ability to ""invest"" in the market. Investing and divesting are proportional: for example, if the market currently contains 2000 ETH and 400 tokens, then an investor would need to provide 2000 * p ETH and 400 * p tokens, which would increase `DEPTH` by a factor of 1 + p and give the investor a `1 / (1 + p)` ""share of the market"". When the investor wants to divest, they are entitled to take out a `1 / (1 + p)` share of whatever ETH and tokens are in the market out at that time (perhaps with a few-hour delay to prevent divesting itself from being subject to front-running during crashes). The theory is that in most cases, the fees collected will be larger than any losses from front-running attacks against the market maker, and the specific mathematical structure of the market maker ensures that risk of loss, while present, is strictly bounded, and in any case investors are the party that will bear the risk.

One concern of the above scheme as given is that the market would have to have a ""maximum price"" after which it runs out of tokens to sell. One solution is that at some point (eg. when `PRICE` is more than half the maximum price) instead of increasing `DEPTH`, the market simply keeps the depth the same and holds the tokens so as to increase the maximum price that the market can sell at. The market may even choose to _decrease_ depth automatically. One stronger solution is to make depth itself proportional to `1 / PRICE`, and change the formulas accordingly, but this leads to the opposite problem if the price goes too low; hence, some kind of dynamic balancing is going to be necessary in any case.

The advantage of this scheme from an efficiency perspective is that it offers very low spreads, but at the same time only requires a blockchain transaction for actual trades, not placing or cancelling orders. The design is also relatively simple to understand and implement.

**Edit**: for those looking at this thread in the future, I thought I would add a simplification suggested by Martin Koppelmann. The mechanism would be a smart contract that holds A tokens of type T1, and B tokens of type T2, and maintains the invariant that A * B = k for some constant k (in the version where people can invest, k can change, but only during investment/withdrawal transactions, NOT trades). Anyone can buy or sell by selecting a new point on the xy=k curve, and supplying the missing A tokens and in exchange receiving the extra B tokens (or vice versa). The ""marginal price"" is simply the implicit derivative of the curve xy=k, or y/x.",240.0,2016-10-03 04:04:05,0.98

How slow transactions influence mining profitability - long term consequences,"Currently mining distribution is very healthy:

One block which takes about 1s with parity (best option now) costs an attacker about 0.03 eth what is 1,5% of mining reward. One second spend on a computation is a 6,6% of a 15s blocktime. Isn't it better for a miner to not include any transactions at all?

I'm not sure I fully understand uncle reward mechanism. Uncle rate is growing too, but bigger miners has less of them. Are smaller miners compensated enough to not be out of a game after a few days of such attack?

"Ethereum Blockhashes and Commitment mechanism as a on-chain provably fair, tamper-resistant, no limit stake, R.N.G. for P.o.W. and P.o.S.",">Anyone who considers arithmetical methods of producing random digits is, of course, in a state of
sin.
John Von Neumann, 1951.

>God, grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change, Courage to change the things I
can, And wisdom to know the difference.
Reinhold Niebuhr, 1934

I describe here what may be a solution to the pseudo R.N.G. problem for public blockchains
such as Ethereum. I construct a source of pseudo R.N.G. that can provide a result at each
block of the chain and which does not rely on any (oracle-based) external source of R.N.G..

The result of the pseudo R.N.G. relies on a **future blockhash mixed with a commit/reveal
mechanism of a seed from a trusted peer**. This scheme makes any miner cheating moot since
**the impact of any change to the blockhash is not known at the time the miner computes the
block on which the R.N.G. relies.** 

This results holds no matter the stake on the R.N.G. result and is thus valid for Proof of Work and Proof of Stake blockchains. Finally, I consider the fact that the seed provider is the only potential source of tampering if he has a significant mining power. But the (trusted) seed provider can be monitored via statistical analysis and also constrained to the use a specific mechanism of seed/secret production based on a BIP39 HD key pair generation. The master seed can be revealed after each period to confirm that the seed generation process is sound.

Most importantly, **the seed provider can be anyone, even one of the stakers, and a multi-seed mechanism can be built as an enhancement of the proposed solution.**

**The process and pseudo R.N.G**

• Step 1 : **A trusted peer commits an encrypted seed** to a smart contract I propose to use
sha3(bytes32 seed, bytes32 secret)

• Step 2 : **A stake (or bet) is committed** by a third party on the pseudo R.N.G.

• Step 3 : The block which includes the step 2 transaction is **validated/mined**
 A **blockhash is now available** for this stake or bet. (note that this blockhash was not known at step 2.)

• Step 4 : Once the step 3 blockhash has been committed by the miners/validators, **the trusted peer reveals the seed and the secret** in clear form to the smart contract. The smart contract computes the pseudo R.N.G. result and solves the bet placed at step 2 by using :

> uint( sha3(blockhash, seed) ) % (odds+1)

To  the  best  of  my  knowledge  this  pseudo  R.N.G.  mechanism  provides  the first  **fully  on  chain
provably  fair  R.N.G.  that  allows  an  unlimited  stake  size  and  does  not  rely  on  any  third  party
oracle.**  It is also very fast since it is theoretically able to provide a different result at each block
(scaling with block time).  
With this respect it provides a faster and more secure solution than the clever RANDAO solutions that requires at least 6 blocks.  Also it is more gas effective and requires no additional stake of R.N.G. providers.  This solution has the merit of not making the different applications of the blockchain interdependent can rely on different seeds.  **Finally, since
the incentive problem is solved, the proposed R.N.G. is most likely fully transposable to any Proof of Stake framework.**

The Crowdsale Analyst: SingularDTV - Three Projects In One?,"The Crowdsale Analyst: SingularDTV - Three Projects In One?
 
Back again with another crowdsale evaluation. I'll do my best during the coming weeks to work through the currently announced ones (Gnosis, Golem etc) and please add information and question my info and conclusions so we can make good and rational evaluations of these crowdsales.

As usual I will score each of the below categories from 0 to 5, with 3 being neutral in the eyes of the investor. Below 3 is bad for the investor and above 3 is good for the investor (and could be good for the project as well).

DISCLAIMER: I am a holder of several different cryptocoins, and I have invested in several crypto related projects. This following is my own opinion, while trying to be as neutral as I can.

Past evaluations:  
[The Crowdsale Analyst: Kibo ICO — Where is thy team?](https://medium.com/@danielzakrisson/ethereum-evaluation-kibo-ico-fd5f9a3fcd73#.9e7xqgafc)

#Project: Singular DTV
Singulars tagline is 'A Blockchain Entertainment Studio, Smart Contract Rights Management Platform and Video On-Demand Portal' - phew, that's a lot of info in one sentence.

##Team/Founders  4/5
**Do these guys have what it takes to succeed as entrepreneurs? Track record and previous projects? Experience and formal education?**  

First of all, Singular is a ConsenSys backed project with Joseph Lubin (former Ethereum COO) listed as it's CTO. Consensys (founded by Lubin) is a software/startup studio based in Brooklyn, mainly focused on Ethereum projects.  

Zach LeBeau, the CEO has both business experience and has experience from the entertainment industry - having produced music and written, produced and directed several tv and movie projects in the past.

Kim Jackson [imdb](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1669333/), Chief Creative Officer has produced several top tier movies.

From the looks of this team, they seem to have gathered a top team with the right experience and drive to fulfill the vision of this project. 

However, Joseph Lubin will clearly not work fulltime on the project (because of many other commitments) and there are no other technical persons listed in the founding team. Despite this they have a great team, and a great backing from ConsenSys to be able to find the resources they need along the way.


##Market Potential 4/5
Singular have chosen to go for three different markets with some synergy effects between them. They will be a TV/movie production company, a digital rights management platform and a TV on demand platform.

The TV/movie industry is a clear hit and miss industry. They give clear goals for the number of views for the proposed TV series and documentaries and how these convert to revenue. They give examples of block buster TV shows (like 9 million views for a finale of Game of Thrones) and put their goal to 2 million views over 24-36 months. If they reach their goal they will have an return on investment for the TV series of 140 % which seems like a great number. However this number must be very uncertain, it could just as well be 500k views or 8 million views over the given time frame. 

In the long run, building a highly profitable content creation studio could be very lucrative for investors - but that all depends on the quality and reach of the produced content.

Second, the TV on demand platform is not given any numbers in the summary overview. This is a very interesting technological project but hard to value since it is also a hit and miss market. You either get the traction needed to grow and establish yourself in the marketplace or vain away.

Third, the digital rights management platform is the technological project given the largest development budget ($2 million). This could make sense. I would assume it's easier to establish yourself in this nascent market, if its a good platform there will be many independent film and music producers willing to use the service and this service is not dependent on the network effect in the same way as the TVOD platform.

In summary, they are shooting for three potentially very large markets (I'll leave it at that) which should give them a chance to pivot the business model and focus on one of these if needed in the future.


##Product/Business/Operating Plan 3/5
**Proof of concept available? How many iterations are done? MVP available? Is the product validated by outside users? 2/5**  
They have a running website, the scripts for the TV and movie projects seems to be done. They have released some video explanations of what they are trying to achieve.

For the technological platforms I little information or timeline for the development. Ujo Music (the potential partner for Digial Rights Management) does not have any demo what I can see. In fact, their latest blog post indicates that they are still exploring the space [Ujo Blog](https://blog.ujomusic.com/welcome-back-1addcc06bcc6#.sg7jdk4ps).

**What is the current operating plan and why do they need funding *now*?  4/5**  
They have a clear time table for releasing the Singular tv-series, first documentary film and the short documentary series. These projects require the funds asked for to become reality.

**What is the go-to market strategy? 2/5**  
They spend around 8 lines of text in the summary paper discussing the need for a robust and creative marketing campaign (that is very short).  

Since they are a video production company I can only assume they will be able to produce very high level content when reaching out. My only concern is that they mention they will do it with thought-provoking content and some very niche keywords (blockchain, transhumanism etc.), I hope this will not make them too specialised but that they will still appeal to the general sci-fi and tech interested audience as well.

**Roadmap 3/5**  
This is the roadmap from the published summary paper:
>SEPTEMBER 2016, LAUNCH	of	‘The	SingularDTV	CODE’ tokenized ecosystem  
OCTOBER 2016, Production begins	for	‘Singular the	TV	series  
DECEMBER 2016, Release	of S-DTV’s	first	Documentary film into the	marketplace  
FEBRUARY 2017, Release of short form documentary series	Episode	1,	with release schedule of 1 per week	for	8 weeks  
JUNE 2017, The premiere and worldwide release of “Singular”, Season	1  

This roadmap seems reasonable with clear timings for each project, downside is that they don't mention the digital rights manegement system. We need a deadline for that as well.

##Competition 3/5 
**Do they have a clear view of the competition? How do they plan to beat them?**    

They are clearly aware of the competition in the space for all three projects, but there is no discussion about the competition.

##Valuation 2/5 
**Is valuation sane? 2/5**  
As a refreshing change from many other crowdsales they have set a clear goal with their fundraising, $7.5 million in order to fund their project pipeline. To raise this they are releasing 1 billion SNGLS. 500 million goes to the fundraising participants, 400 million to the project, and 100 million to a set of core investors.

All future revenue coming into the system from the above projects will go through a mechanism where they are splitted to the above three groups (in those proportions). The holders of the 400 millions (the founders) have pledged to never collect this revenue for themselves but to reinvest this in the ecosystem. 

Is the fundraising sane? Well, hard to say. The founders are keeping 50 % of the project for themselves which seems like a very big part.

I would have prefered structure where the project automatically receive a share of the revenues (40 % with no tokens attached), the founders are given a part of the tokens (say 20 %) that they will vest over the time proposed to complete these projects.

**What is the exit potential and exit options? 2/5**  
Nothing is said about exit strategies, but it can be assumed the tokens will be traded on exchanges.   

However, there is no mechanism for an investor to get out of the investment before the tokens are listed and tradeable which is a minus.

The only exit mechanism mentioned in the paper is that if anyone of the founders exit the project, they will recieve their part of the 400 million SNGLS and the revenue that comes with these. 

##Legality 4/5
**As an investor? 4/5**  
The current summary paper clearly state that this is not an investment offer. Later in the paper they clearly describe the revenue sharing propeties of the SNGLs. Since this is not a final fundraising paper I assume they will add to the disclaimers and make it clear it's not an investment in the eyes of the SEC.

**Legality of the business 5/5**  
Singular will produce their own content which they will own 100 %. In the platforms they will work directly with other content owners to list and sell their content. I see no legal risks in that business model.


##Security 3/5
**How long has an operational proof of concept been live on the testnet (Morden)? 3/5**  
They have a blog post describing security testing, token distribution testing and payment API testing posted in August 2016.

**Proof of external security evaluation? 3/5**  
Not available

**Special security needs for this project? 3/5**  
Nothing more than in any other big, complex Ethereum project. 

#Conclusion 4/5
At first I was sceptical about this project. But reading through the available summary paper and looking up the founders team they seem to have a great team and a well prepared business plan. They have interesting synergies to bootstrap their tv on demand and digital rights management platforms with quality content. They are prepared and have a clear need for the funds now, and they have a realistic budget for project costs.   

My biggest concern is the system they created where the founders keep 40 % of the tokens created, which they are seemingly free to use as they wish if they leave the project. Why not give the platform a share of the revenues directly? I would really like to see someone from SingularDTV come forward and explain the rationale and mechanisms behind this in further detail.  

Second negative is if they are trying to do too much at once? They will be a content production company while at the same time building two different digital platforms. Will they be able to focus on each part enough? And do they have enough technical leadership to handle both of these projects?  

Third point is if the tv and film projects will be interesting enough for a big enough audience? If this was a regular production company and you were given the opportunity to invest, would you do it?  

Another negative that could indicate a current focus on form and good looks over technical quality is the website they have created. Without any complex content it still uses up a ton of system resources and makes computers run HOT — if this is the system resource usage they are happy with for a simple things as a website, the front- and backends of their content delivery system they will surely have issues down the road.  

All in all, I think SingularDTV is a quality project and I hope they will succeed.

It’s Time to Get Real: Stop Relying on Third Parties to Protect You & Your Funds. You are responsible for your security.,"# [An updated version can be found here](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/6fr2lx/updated_its_time_to_get_real_stop_relying_on/)

### The Problem

Over the past few months we have seen a huge increase in phishing emails & phishing sites via Google/Bing ads. Along with your easy-to-detect scam sites, these phishing sites have taken the funds of **too many damn users**. This is truly basic stuff, team. Banks, PayPal, email providers, and more have been fighting the good fight against phishers since before Y2K was a thing. If my mom can manage to not to click a suspicious link in an email and *especially* not to then enter her SSN on that link, so should you.

It’s truly impressive that today, with a community comprised mostly of developers and computer-savvy folks, phishers are still managing to steal yo’ shit. 

So. 

It’s time to get real.

You **cannot** rely on a third party to protect you from these. I know from first hand experience. Every single morning and every single night for 62 days now I have sent phishing reports, DMCA takedowns, contacted people on twitter, re-written legal takedown forms in Russian, and so much more in order to attempt to have these sites take down. Google, GoDaddy, Digital Ocean, Microsoft/Bing, Bluehost, CloudFlare, Reg.ru, and *so many more* simply do not take action or do not take action in time. 5-7 days and 10-14 reports later, *sometimes* a site gets taken down. And then the phisher registers a new URL and is up and running in 20 minutes. And the process begins again. I’m sick and tired of this. I’m sick of watching people lose their hard-earned money. 

### The Solution

Here’s what you need to do to protect your own ass. Because, frankly, these multi-million dollar companies don’t care about you, your cyber-money, or your safety. They are in the business of making money and will continue to focus on making money, which includes not changing their fonts to differentiate between I l 1 0 O, not changing their policies regarding taking down phishing sites, not refraining from doing business in the future with a known scammer, and not dealing with the thousands of takedown and abuse reports they get. 

0. **Get yourself a Ledger or Trezor** https://www.ledgerwallet.com & https://shop.trezor.io/

1. **Bookmark your crypto sites** and use those bookmarks. That includes things like: https://www.kraken.com/ https://www.poloniex.com/ https://shapeshift.io/ 

2. **Install an adblocker that actually turns off Google/Bing Ads.** I recommend going with [uBlock Orgin](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ublock-origin/cjpalhdlnbpafiamejdnhcphjbkeiagm?hl=en). If you are already using Adblock Plus, it **does not** hide Google Ads from you. If you are the type of person who literally cannot tell the difference between the ad and the Google result, then you need to go into your Adblock Plus settings and uncheck the box that says “Allow some non-intrusive advertising”. If you have sites you do want to support (ie: reddit.com) then you need to then go and whitelist that specific domain. 

3. **Don’t click on advertisements!!!** With or without an adblocker, you should never, ever click on advertisements. Especially when you just googled myetherwallet.com to find the site, but instead manage to end up on myetherswallet.

4. **Always check the domain when the page is done loading. Then check it again immediately before entering any information.** This includes, but is not limited to, usernames, passwords, email addresses, private keys, and any other personal information. Most of these phishers get SSL certs today so it is not enough to check the SSL cert. You must check the URL itself. 

5. **Don’t click any link regarding anything crypto, money, banking, or a common service like Dropbox / Google Drive / Gmail in any email ever.** And if the scammy clickbait was simply too irresistible for you, don’t freaking enter any information on the page. FYI, MyEtherWallet doesn't have a login. We don't have your email address. We will literally never email you except in direct response to your own email. You have a new file in your Dropbox/Drive/Kraken? Why not click your bookmark instead of the link from the email? Or, at the very least, click the link in the email and if it asks for your username/password close the fuck out of it and go to your bookmark.

6. **If you have accidentally visited or typed a phishing site, clean out your recent history and autocomplete.** This will prevent you from typing `kra…` and having it autocomplete to the malicious `krakken.com`. 

7. **No one is giving you free or discounted ETH. Even for completing a survey.** This is a common one on Twitter these days. Why? Because people freaking fall for it and the phishing scamsters get your money. It doesn’t help that Twitter uses a font that makes all 1 l I 0 O look identical.

8. **Turn on two factor for EVERYTHING.** Go do it. Right now. Quit your excuses. Stop thinking you are too good for 2FA. **Stop being a lazy asshole begging to have their funds and personal information stolen.** While you are at it, if you are using the same password across multiple platforms, CHANGE THEM ALL. Email. Slack. Dropbox. Google. Twitter. Github. Kraken. Poloniex. Coinbase. LastPass. Eveything you log into needs to be on 2fa. Specifics below, especially for Kraken because the amount of failure surrounding people properly securing their Kraken account is unbelievable. 



(More awesome recommendations from the comments! Thank you all!!)

9. **Do NOT keep your funds on an exchange**: There truly aren't any excuses for keeping your funds on an exchange after Mt Gox. Yet nearly 4 years later we are still watching exchanges lose customer funds due to compromised wallets, insecure systems, internal ""bad seed"" employees, and on and on. In 2016 alone we've seen ShapeShift (no customer funds lost thankfully), GateCoin, Bitfinex, Cryptsy, and every single one of their customers suffer. The only funds you should have on an exchange are funds you are actively trading, and no more than you are willing to lose. By the time you learn about a hack, your funds are already gone. Don't be lazy. (Shameless plug: check out the [MEW help page](https://www.myetherwallet.com/#help). It'll walk you thru step-by-step) (thanks /u/Zillacoin).

10. **If you have 2FA on everything, get yourself a password manager**: ...and actually use it. I have one in my browser for non-so-sensitive logins. I personally choose not to store any private keys, ssh, pgp, or primary accounts like Google in there but it's great for ensuring you don't reuse passwords and generating secure passwords. Check out [LastPass](https://lastpass.com/), [Keepass](http://keepass.info/), [Dashlane](https://www.dashlane.com/), and others. Do NOT forget to turn 2FA on your password manager as well!!!!! (thanks /u/cjudge).

11. **Use different browsers, or at least different profiles:** I won't copy and paste the entire thing but [read this comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/556frk/its_time_to_get_real_stop_relying_on_third/d881drv) by /u/mhswende, especially if you are one of those people who already do everything else on this list. You can *always* been more safe.

### 2FA your fraking Kraken

Kraken is a fun one with 2FA and is one of the sites getting hit hardest with phishers right now. So, together, let’s do it correctly. [More info](https://support.kraken.com/hc/en-us/articles/201396837-What-can-I-do-to-make-my-Kraken-account-secure-).

- Login to your Kraken account. 

- In the upper right click on your name. Then click “Security”.

- Change your password right now for the fuck of it. In case you were unaware, it’s a good practice to occasionally change your passwords. Oh, and don’t use the same password across multiple sites. Seriously.

- Once password is up to date, click on “Two-Factor Authentication”. 

- Find “Account Login” and click “Setup”. I prefer Google Authenticator TOTP. [Learn more about TOTP/HOTP here](http://blogs.forgerock.org/petermajor/2014/02/one-time-passwords-hotp-and-totp/).

- Go to your Google Auth app. Add a new code -> “scan a barcode”. Scan the QR code that’s displayed on the Kraken site. This will add a line to your app with a name, some numbers, and a little timer that counts down. Enter the numbers into the field on Kraken and the click “Setup”.

- Now each time you login to Kraken you will need to open the app on your phone and type in the numbers displayed. This also prevents a phisher, even one with your username and password, from ever getting into your account.

- Go back to the Two-Factor page. Setup a method for “Funding”. This requires you to use your 2FA to do any withdrawals or deposits. So even if someone gets into your account, they cannot withdraw or deposit. Note! You need to have a master key password/2fa and your global settings lock TURNED ON in order for the 2fa to do its job!

- Go back and add a master key password -or- edit your existing one. Here is what Kraken told me a while back the Master Key is for: *”Also I noticed that you have a master key set on your account. This is a good idea, but actually you'll need to enable the global settings lock in order for the master key to do it's job. If you check your account regularly, a short time lock, such as 2 or 3 days, should be long enough. Please note that the global settings lock prevents even the Kraken support team from changing your account settings, so be careful. Also, don't set a global settings lock without a master key-- you can always use the master to unlock settings so you can do things like add or delete withdrawal/deposit addresses, etc.”*

- So, the biggest issue with this key is that it is what you will use to lock / unlock your settings and do things like add a new withdrawal address. If it is the same as your Kraken password, the phishers can turn off 2fa and other things. So create one or update the existing one to be DIFFERENT than your standard Kraken password. Seriously. You can also do another Google Authenticator for this, which is recommended.

- Now click on your name again and click account settings. At the very bottom, turn the Global Settings Lock “ON”. The longer the time, the safer your account is. I use 3 days as I'm always within feet of my computer. Next time you are on vacation or going to be away from trading for any extended period of time, update the time again to the amount of time you are going to be away for so you don’t have to worry about it. 




### Other 2FA Information

- **Get the Google Authenticator App -or- the Authy app** 

    - [Authy App](https://www.authy.com/app/) - does both Google Authenticator and has a advanced mode for Coinbase, Gemini and maybe others. (recommended by /u/cjudge)

    - [Google Authenticator for iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/google-authenticator/id388497605)

    - [Google Authenticator for Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.authenticator2)

Evaluation: Kibo ICO,"


There have been a recent flurry of ICO announcements with huge amounts of funds and money being thrown around. In some cases for good use and in some cases directly to fund pump & dump schemes or worse, to fund very shady and potentially illegal get rich schemes for the founders.  

There is a growing awareness that also Ethereum ICOs/investments/crowdsales needs to be evaluated sanely and to do my part I will start a series of posts that goes through the currently announced projects and evaluates then from my viewpoint. This could of course be done much more diligently, but I will try to keep it short and informative enough to highlight the main points of each question.

I will score each of the below categories from 0 to 5, with 3 being neutral in the eyes of the investor. Below 3 is bad for the investor and above 3 is good for the investor (and could be good for the project as well).

##Project: Kibo Lottery
Kibo aims to be a global lottery platform, available on a number of platforms and in a number of languages. A key part of the platform will be affiliate marketing by Kibo platform members.

###Team/Founders  0/5
**Do these guys have what it takes to succeed as entrepreneurs? Track record and previous projects? Experience and formal education?**  

Neither on the web site or in the white paper there is any information about the team or the team size. This is very unfortunate and a serious warning flag as the team is the single most important factor for a successful product.


###Market Potential 4/5
Obviously huge. They state that over 30 % of the worlds online gambling market ($85 billion) is in lotteries and I have no reason to believe this isn't in the right ballpark. The follow up question is of course how many of current global online gambling participants are savvy enough to handle an Ethereum based system? Not so many but the numbers will grow.  

  
This is also a great showcase market for smart contracts and Ethereum technology.

###Product/Business/Operating Plan 1/5
**Proof of concept available? How many iterations are done? MVP available? Is the product validated by outside users? 1/5**  
This is not clear. The lotto product is clearly not developed yet, but they mention user tests with the marketing tool.

**What is the current operating plan and why do they need funding *now*?  1/5**  
According to information on the website, they already have funding of 94538 ETH [etherscan](http://etherscan.io/address/0x38355ab2667eD167CaDcD132603bc6236c8295de). At current eth prices this is around 1.2 million USD. The only clear motivation given for the ICO is to get funds for marketing (45 %), Development and Operating Expenses (40 %) and Contingencies (15 %).

From the Kibo website:  
>Funds received from the token sale will be used primarily for marketing purposes, including the formation of the prize fund that will be drawn within the series of free draws, which will be launched when the KIBO LOTTO platform starts. Also for further platform development – including the upcoming update, development and design of new user interfaces, technical implementation, testing and contract optimization.  
.
 
>
The funds will also be directed at expanding the team and for remuneration of Kibo employees, administrative and logistics costs, legal fees and operating expenses for current and future challenges aimed at the effective development of the KIBO LOTTO platform

They give no motivation for why the ICO money is needed at this stage other that to give away in free prizes, which is very bad. The current cash reserves of 1.2 million USD should be able to take them very far in terms of providing a Proof of Concept product, MVP and then the final product to launch.

**What is the go-to market strategy? 4/5**  
They have a well thought out strategy for viral and affiliate marketing, giving economic incentives for participants to recruit new particpants in a giant pyramid a la Tupperware.

**Roadmap 1/5**  
This is the roadmap from the published white paper:
>The launch of the KIBO platform will take place in the following stages:
1. BTC: Launch of the lottery on Bitcoin, Presale.  
2. Start: Implementation of work on Ethereum franchisee account contracts,  
two lotteries. Start of token sales.
3. Go: Start of two additional lotteries  
4. Work: System market launch, fixing of contracts.  
5. GUI: Decentralization of lottery user interface (Mist)  

This is a very vague roadmap and does not give any expectations on when the platform is ready for launch. They are also planning to launch without providing Proof of Concepts, MVPs and a launch of the platform on the testnet.

The website has another roadmap that states 
>KIBOLOTTO Platform Launch Winter 2016


###Competition 1/5 
**Do they have a clear view of the competition? How do they plan to beat them?**    

There is no mention of competition on the website or in the whitepaper which is very bad. Even if they are in a god spot within the crypto space as the first lotto, they will still have to deal and compete with the old world lottos.

###Valuation 1/5 
**Is valuation sane? 0/5**  
100 000 000 Kibo tokens will be distributed in an ICO sale. The cost of each token is set to:  
First 5 days 50 KIBIT/1ETH  
Next 5 days 40 KIBIT/1ETH  
Next 10 days 35 KIBIT/1ETH  
Next 10 days 30 KIBIT/1ETH  
Next 10 days 25 KIBIT/1ETH  
At 50 Kibit per ETH, at current prices, they've valued the ICO to at least ~$26,000,000.

Any unsold tokens will be gifted to the founding team. No matter how much is raised the project will launch [reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethtrader/comments/54wbto/after_much_pressure_kibo_finally_release_their/)

This kind of valuation for a non existing product seems totally crazy, even if there is a huge market potential.

**What is the exit potential and exit options? 2/5**  
Nothing is said about exit strategies, but it can be assumed the tokens will be traded on exchanges.   

However, there is no mechanism for an investor to get out of the investment before the tokens are listed and tradeable which is a huge minus.

###Legality 0/5
**As an investor? 0/5**  
This is clearly mark as an ICO and the KIBIT token is named as an investment in the white paper, which will with all probability qualify this as an security by the SEC in the US. This in turn means that US investors should be very careful with investing as it potentially can give them future legal problems in the US.   
  
The founders also put a legal risk in the US on themselves if they ever would like to go or visit there.

**Legality of the business 0/5**  
This is a special case for Kibo. Online gambling is regulated in most parts of the world. In the US it is mostly prohibited and in the EU it is regulated and you need a valid license in at least one of the member states.  
  
Promoting and marketing an online gambling product in one of these places without proper license does not only put a large risk on the founders of the company, but also on each individual token holder that participate in any kind of marketing or promotion.

**THIS IS A HUGE RISK AND SHOULD BE SERIOUSLY CONSIDERED BY ANYONE INTERESTED IN THIS ICO**

###Security 0/5
**How long has an operational proof of concept been live on the testnet (Morden)? 0/5**  
Not available

**Proof of external security evaluation? 0/5**  
Not available

**Special security needs for this project? 0/5**  
In any gambling related project the random number generator used is of the utmost importance. They have published code snippets in the white paper, but I have not seen anyone reputable discussing or approving this method for random number generation.

As been shown by virtually all large Ethereum projects so far, Ethereum security is very hard. You have to get it right the first time, and without previous work to fall back on and working prototypes on the test net there is no guarantee what so ever that the development team can produce secure code.

##Conclusion
There you have it, a long post but one that I hope highlight some important points. Personally I would never go near this project. Totally failing the singe most important point (the founding team), handing over a huge legal risk to its participants and providing no Ethereum specific security confidence makes is the main points for me.

I have taken ETH for granted,"I have truly started my blockchain adventure with Ethereum. I have been following Bitcoin and the rest from the very start but I have been on the sidelines until early this year. I primarily mine ETH, but, I took a side bar and mined Monero to see what is was like.  Everything from a miners perspective seemed to be the same (to be honest a lot more primitive. Genoil and everyone else did a fantastic job).  I also bought other alts on exchanges.  Then I wanted to consolidate everything to simplify my holdings and invest.  Well was I ever disappointed.  I moved all my Eth in seconds.  I have been waiting for hours Bitcoin, Monero and other alts to confirm (I ran out of beer).  To be perfectly honest I am fine with the 14 seconds or less confirmations.  If ETH gets the 3-5 second target it will be like the Juggernaut; unstoppable. 

Keep up the fantastic work.

Let us not forget our *collective power* in building up our grandest dreams for the blockchain & beyond...,"Ever since theDao exploit/hard fork, and in regards to dreaming grand dreams of the amazing potential for the Ethereum blockchain to change the world, I feel like the community head has collectively crept back underneath its shell - very much clinging to focus on crowdsales/trading/security/etc. 

While these events are certainly sobering reminders that we should not get too swept away or act hastily (and that securing the foundations of the blockchain/code are essential), we should also not forget the kind of awe-inspiring ideas and experimentation that got us here in the first place.

IMO, what is worse than the hack/hard fork is for the community to stop dreaming those big dreams about the Ethereum blockchain's awesome potential.  

I was a part of many TheDAO conversations and idea-building on consider.it/dao forums -  and I have to say we were really *catching fire*.  We were all clawing at some pretty darn futuristic ideas, and they didnt feel too far out of reach mainly because the *hive mind* was buzzing away on them as one unit.  We really need to get back to this collective intelligent organization and idea-growing, IMO.  We need to seek out platforms to harnass and organize the great power of our *collective intelligence*.  *We cannot rely on The Foundation forever.*  Everyone here (in our consensus) is the true foundation of Ethereum.  

So, please, lets get back to dreaming those grand dreams, sharing them, and collectively/actively working on them together.  Lets send Ethereum to Mars, together!

What platforms are available right now to harness this collective power?  
Please discuss...
THANKS!

"ICO contract idea: gradual release of ETH to developers, and tokens redeemable for share of ETH left","There's been some discussion about how app ICOs could be done in a way that is fair, incentivises the developers properly and protects the investors from pump n' dumps and outright scams. See for example [this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/54iyz4/thoughts_on_the_first_blood_crowdsale_and_how_to/) for some good discussion.

What I haven't seen others suggest yet is gradual release of the ETH to the developers to be able to sell. For example, in the case of FirstBlood, the contract could have made 5% (maybe with a maximum of 25,000) of the ETH instantly available. Then it could have gradually released 50% during the first year after the sale, and the rest during the second year.

Of course, that alone would just delay the inevitable. To be useful, the contract would need to allow investors to redeem their app tokens for their share of the ETH left in the contract. In the above example, if the average exchange rate for ICO tokens / ETH would ~~be~~ have been 170 tokens / 1 ETH during crowdsale, then you could return any number of tokens to the contract and get back 0.95 ETH per 170 tokens right after the crowdsale, or 0.45 ETH per 170 after a year. After 2 years all the ETH would be in the hands of the developers, and investors could no longer get anything back from the contract. The returned tokens could either be burned or locked for something like 3 years starting from the ICO sale before the developers can sell them.

I admit that adds some complexity to the ICO contracts, but it's still much more simple and more predictable than e.g. letting the token holders vote on any use of the crowdsale ETH. On the other hand, it would be a huge improvement over the current standard way the ICOs are done in terms of keeping the developers motivated and protecting investors from pump n' dumps and scams. In addition, there would be no need to prevent trading of the tokens on exchanges.

There still remains the questions of locking the token stashes that the developers keep for themselves. The only point of such a stash is additional incentive for the devs to make the project succeed. Therefore, it might be reasonable to lock them for at least 2 years after the ICO sale.

Please let me know if I'm making any mistakes above. If there are no flaws in my reasoning, and if this kind of contract would be reasonably simple to implement, I don't see why this type of contract wouldn't be the least we can expect from an app ICO. Of course a more complex contract offering even more protection and power for the investors could be even better, but they might need to be researched more first (to not repeat TheDAO).",20.0,2016-09-27 09:55:35,0.92

Euler: The simplest exchange and currency,"Here's an idea I've been kicking around since DevCon. Feedback welcome, of course.

To be clear, I'm not likely to build this: I suspect it would be rich with opportunities for conflicts of interest with my work at the foundation. But I really hope someone does - so if you find this interesting, consider it an idea free for the taking.

# Euler: The simplest exchange and token currency

Euler is an idea for a decentralized token exchange that removes much of the complexity of traditional market-making token exchange, while simultaneously providing its own token, whose value is determined by the basket of token currencies it is backed by.

## Basic operation

Euler has a list of approved token currencies, and holds balances of each. These tokens are owned by the exchange, and are sold to it by users in return for Euler tokens. At any time, anyone with Euler can trade it in for any of the underlying token currencies, and vice-versa.

The quantity of Euler a user gets for selling a token to the exchange depends on the number of tokens the exchange already holds of that type. The cost of the nth Euler (counting from zero) is `e^n` - so the first Euler issued costs 1 token, the second e tokens, the third e^2, and so forth.

Users can exchange one external token for another by first buying Euler with the token they want to sell, then buying the desired currency with the Euler. The contract should offer this option as a single atomic trade to reduce price risk.

Though it may seem very strange to assign all tokens equal initial value, the result is that with multiple tokens in the exchange, a price equlibrium is reached when the relative prices of different tokens reflects their market value - or equivalently, when the exchange owns equal values of all available token types.

Since this is a zero-sum system, the total of all outstanding Euler is always the amount required to purchase from the exchange all of its assets. Thus, we should expect the market capitalization of Euler to be equal to the sum of all the tokens held by the exchange; since the total value of each token is equal, this provides effective insulation against variation in the price of any individual token.

## Adding tokens

One problem arises when new tokens are being added to the system. Because of the asymptotic nature of the value of each token, a massive advantage is available to first movers, who may be rewarded disproportionately for their contribution of the new token type.

This can be eliminated if, instead of starting trading on the new token with an initial balance of 0, we first run an auction phase, allowing users to offer tokens to the exchange in return for Euler. One proposed mechanism is as follows:

 1. A new token is added, with a 1 week auction period.
 2. During the auction period, users submit bids, consisting of some quantity of the new token, along with a commitment to the minimum value in Euler they are willing to sell each token for.
 3. Once the auction ends, a reveal phase begins, where users are required to reveal the prices of their bids. Bids are sorted first by bid price, from lowest to highest, then by submission time, from earliest to latest.
 4. The exchange now determines the largest number of Euler that can be exchanged, by iterating through the list filling bids until the bid price is higher than the price in Euler of an additional token. This price becomes the initial price of the new token.
 5. All users whose bids are greater than the determined price now receive tokens at that price, and all users whose bids are less than that price receive refunds of their tokens.
 6. The market begins trading as normal.

 In this manner, a new market can be opened at or near equilibrium with existing markets, by relying on users to set bid prices that reflect the relative value of the new token against the already traded tokens.

## Other Considerations

### Launch

 One remaining issue regards the best manner in which to launch the market. The process detailed above cannot be used to introduce multiple initial currencies when there are not yet any on the exchange, as users have no information on which to base their bid prices, since they depend on the final volume of the market. One possible solution would be to list a single token at first, such as Ether, accepting all bids. The quantity added to the market in this way then provides a reference point for subsequently adding more tokens.

### Governance: Proposals to add tokens and to suspend trading

 Whoever has the ability to add new tokens to the market has significant power; a malicious actor could add a new token only they are able to obtain, allowing them to effectively issue themselves as many Euler as they wish. A governance system that permits Euler holders to propose, vote on, and approve new tokens may be considered, though the risk of hostile takeover is not insignificant.

 Should one of the tokens traded on Euler be compromised, the same issue with a flood of tokens being used to buy Euler and cash out in currencies that have not been exploited is present. A mechanism should be devised by which some party can quickly halt purchases to prevent this.

"First Blood, the ""Power Hour"" gate: why did First Blood have a partnership to circumvent their own (crazy) crowdsale rules?","Just found the announcement of the [partnership between FirstBlood and Yunbi](https://community.firstblood.io/t/firstblood-partners-with-yunbi-for-esports-token-crowdsale/76)

I find that part really puzzling

> One of the defining features of our crowdsale is the all-important Power Hour (the first hour of the crowdsale), when 1SŦ will be available at a 70% discount. Thanks to Yunbi, buying in during this important hour will be completely hassle-free.

So FirstBlood comes up with a ridiculously competitive, inconvenient, and constraining crowdsale system where everything is likely to get sorted within 1h in spite of the fact this kind of format is known to increase risk of major fuck up (see Decent's similar attempt with their limited quantity first tiers which led to their servers getting overloaded and forced them to change the format). And yet, although they state themselves that this completely biased system is ""all important"" (go figure why) and a ""defining feature"", they create a partnership with Yunbi that allows to completely circumvent their own constraints. 

And effectively, on D-Day Yunbi's orders turned out to get the good favors of large miners and have their transactions confirmed right away whereas pretty much everyone else got put in the backlog with all the spam (which had just resumed in another surprising coincidence) and had to wait many blocks to be picked by a miner.

What does that tell us? Why was the Power Hour ""all important"" and a ""defining feature"" if it was to be completely circumvented by First Blood's own initiative?

The only explanation that seems to make sense is that the Power Hour was designed to incentivize crowdsale participants to use Yunbi and was probably part of the deal with Yunbi. I don't see other reasons to create that much hassle and then make Yunbi the only hassle free option. 

But then why not simply have Yunbi run openly the crowdsale? Why the giant bait and switch of a ""smart contract based"" crowdsale that turns out to have been almost entirely sorted on a private exchange? Why piss off a large number of supporters among which most of the technically proficient folks who knew how to participate directly, didn't expect that kind of trick and therefore didn't see the need for having Yunbi hold their hands?

Thoughts on the First Blood Crowdsale and how to conduct future crowdsales,"I imagine a lot of the Yunbi-owned First Blood tokens will be flipped as soon as it's possible to do so.  If that's the case, then those owners don't care one iota about the long term future of the platform.  I had no interest in this crowdsale, but it is instructive for how to think about how future crowdsales could be structured to better align incentives between founders and token buyers.

The goal of founders, in a crowdsale, should be to align their own interests with those of people who truly want to see their platform succeed.  To that end, one possibility is a long lock-up, say one year, but maybe even two years, where tokens cannot be sold.  That way, most flippers would be eliminated as potential buyers and replaced by basically only people who have genuine interest in the long term success of the platform.

I hope there will be some thought and discussion about this in the community.",41.0,2016-09-26 04:26:43,0.87
DGX and the Synergy Prophecy,"Well - I missed the 1stBlood crowdsale today since my friend was getting married. Whoops. But then it got me thinking...all of these technologies are creating an incredible opportunity for a stable coin to become integrated into them.

1) To be successful these applications NEED (ok it would help at least) a stable token of value to transact with and push the speculative focus into the relevant application logic and not let the currency of choice be a distraction. 

2) IF DigixGlobal can deliver with their tech - DGX could be poised to become the defacto transaction standard within applications like Augur, Plutus, Firstblood, Golum...etc. This community desperately needs a true stable coin to anchor itself into. I think at this point a stable coin tying the gold bar to an Ethereum token is the best blend of past and future - melding the human desire to have something tangible and yet also have something transactable at the speed of the 21st century. Its like having your hand in two pots of honey at the same time. And being able to fling that honey all around the world at light speed.

3) DGX market cap is an interesting measure - since it IS a stable coin - it is not susceptible to large sell offs and crashes. If Satoshi sold off all his coins tomorrow then the price of BTC would tank. DGX is not susceptible to this. Market cap of DGX is a 1 to 1 mapping between token and physical supply and it should be highly accurate when measured. Sell offs like this should not change the price of DGX whatsoever. This is a very interesting property. Market means MARKET CAP. There is not actually 10 billion dollars of bitcoin in the world right now. Not even close. This will not be the case with DGX.

4) I truly believe that DGX is going to be a huge success and it will be nice to see a link between the physical world and the crypto economy headed by such a professional organization that seems to have the best ideals of blockchain technology in mind. The fact that the DevCon2 speech from Digix was related to security speaks volumes.

Coinbase is what Silicon Valley Bank should have been,"TL;DR - this is a bit of a rant from my poor experiences with Silicon Valley startups' favorite bank, and some praise for Coinbase and a hope they end up becoming the bank all SV startups use in the near future (assuming they want that).

I have contracted and worked for a few bay area startups, and they all use a bank called Silicon Valley Bank. That name probably conjures up an image of a super hi-tech bank running on all the latest technology... unfortunately that is the exact opposite of reality.

At one point this bank was holding up a payment owed me. When talking with my bank, they confirmed that Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) wasn't releasing the funds. They called to see what could be done, and my bank was told to **FAX** some documents to them, and only between their hours of operation which was **10AM to 3PM**. They also close for lunch. You should have seen the look on the face of my account rep at Chase.

Another incident involved setting up autopay on a corp credit card. There is no way to actually do that through their site (and they have 4 or so different options for signing in, which lead to different sites that do different things... so user friendly). After my company asked them about it, our rep said they would get it set up, and reported back later that it was done. When the next bill wasn't paid, it turned out that the credit card number entered for autopay had a typo and they had to fix it. That's right, they don't have an automated way of turning on autopay, they apparently have someone TYPING IN INFORMATION to do it... cause there is no other explanation for a typo and not having a way for us to just turn it on through our account login (like every other bank in existence).

So now you're wondering, ""why the hell are SVB used by all these bay area startups!?"" After asking around, I got some answers. It turns out that instead of putting their money and resources into solid tech, they pour it into a behemoth of a marketing force. If you are a startup in the bay area, SVB will send sales people to your office over and over again, even after you are using them (apparently they can't track who has finally signed up with them). They get this info in part from the VCs, whom they have cleverly cultivated close connections with. Good on SVB for their marketing strategy, but apparently they have never bothered to follow that up with actually delivering on something worthy of a name like ""Silicon Valley Bank"".

Coinbase, on the other hand, has support available essentially 24/7 over chat and email, monitors reddit for issues, has a crypto exchange and deals directly with the purchase and transfer of bitcoin and **ether**, and [uses modern scalable backend infrastructure on AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/solutions/case-studies/coinbase/) including lambda and container based microservices. While SVB has an app, it has been downloaded less than 10k times on Android and has a poor rating and vicious reviews, while the Coinbase app has over 500k downloads and a great rating and reviews. Even though Coinbase is focused on bitcoin and ether, you can hold USD with them and even get a debit card through them.

As far as I am concerned, Coinbase should be the bank the Silicon Valley startups use, not SVB. Coinbase is actually a hi-tech bank, worthy of a Silicon Valley title, while SVB should be considered a bit of an embarrassment. I honestly don't know if Coinbase is setup for doing business banking, but I encourage any new bay area startups to go bug Coinbase about being your bank, and to ignore SVB and their army of sales people they will send your way.

End rant.

Ethereum Wallet `geth` Client Not Syncing - Possible Problems With Bootnodes,"The bootnodes may be congested due to the many `geth` clients trying to get connections as the clients are being restarted due to the recent memory bug attack and spam / IO transaction attacks.

Please delay your crowdsales and contract deployment,"We have crowdsales planned from early next week but I'm concerned about the rush. We've put the dao behind us but I fear risks are being taken again. 

1) allow enough time for contracts to be examined. E.g. I like first blood but I've yet to meet anyone who has sufficiently examined their contract. If a non standard contract is used it needs multiple eyes and preferably a security audit from known eth professionals. 

2) ethereum is currently in a somewhat limited state and many users are unable to use it properly. Doing a crowdsale in these conditions is a bad idea and we have frustrated users. 

3) Much of the eth development community will be in transit/recoving or in bali (concensys!). They should have a chance to feedback on all the recent issues and check contracts. 

I'd urge people not to rush into things for the sake of a few weeks.

> **Sessions**

**Factom. Blockchain Technology tools for net gen asset systems**

Most of old asset records are paper based, difficult to update.
Databases are too easy to modify. Blockchain is a happy medium.

They have a way to do document tracking on Blockchain.

**Zcash**

Issue is privacy on the Blockchain. It is a giant shared database, everyone can see what you are transacting. Like trading securities.
Possible solutions: Private chain, restricted read access.

Could try to do it off chain and put hash on chain, but then the blockchain is just a timestamping service.
Encryption can hide the values, but not the people.
Ring encryption can hide the people.

Zero-knowledge security layer. Enables private transactions. Supports ""Selective disclosure"".

What the 2 parties see: Alice sells 1,0000 MSFT to Bob at USD 97.123

What the trade repository aggregator sees (selective disclosure): <blank> sells 1,0000 MSFT to <blank> at USD 97.123 

What everyone else sees: <blank> sells <blank>  to <blank> at <blank>

Internet has a security encryption layer (SSL).  Cryptography (SSL) was required to let the Internet grow.
Blockchain needs a security layer (ZK security layer)

Plans on releasing their zCash Blockchain on Oct 28

**Bloq**

http://bloq.com/
Bringing Enterprise to Blockchain.
Trying to be like Redhat for Blockchain. Enterprise support 24/7, security fixes, monthly subscription.

""Blockchain operating system"". On-premises software stack.

**Open Bazaar**

https://openbazaar.org/
Open distributed trade market. With no fees.
Ebay & Taobao are C2C (Consumer to Consumer) trade platforms.
Has an escrow style payment system. Buyer puts money into escrow, merchant sends, buyer releases from escrow.

Ebay is completely centralised. Every communication goes through Ebay and you pay them for the privilege.
Open Bazaar is distributed, you talk direct to each other.

Challenges of Building Decentralised markets: P2P software more complex than standard websites. Designing incentives to encourage users to act responsibly. Ensuring software is secure & reliable. Translate difficult tech into mainstream user experience.

Benefits of buying & selling on OpenBazaar: sell ANYTHING you want, anywhere (some things just aren't available for purchase in that country). No buyer or seller fees. No data collection by 3rd parties. No restrictions on how you operate your business. Market of moderators that compete to provide quality dispute resolution.

Can purchase weird things like hot sauce, and North Korean cigarettes.

Version 2.0, you can purchase digitital goods (music, videos) and get it delivered instantly. Great for sellers as they will get to keep all the revenue, and not lose the 30% cut that iTunes takes.

**Chronicaled**

A turnkey solution to securely connect physical goods to a Blockchain.
Blockchain benefits for IoT are incresingly recognized by developers and enterprise, and hundres of potential physical world use cases have been identitifed.
The lack of a turnkey solutoin to securely connect and engage with assets with assets on chain is a huge barrier to development.

Turnkey solution: Ethereum smart contracts. BLE & NFS microchip inventory. Custom, secure chip firmware. Registration & authentication SDK. Open registry explorer. Tamperproof form factors so people can't functionally remove the chip.
Device sends a challenge to the chip. Private key securely stored in the chip signs the challenge.
Signed challenge is compared to public key stored on Blockchain.
Has an open registry explorer (blockchain explorer)

Use cases: Authenticity & provenance. Handbags, fine art, wine, collectible sneakers, event ticketing.
Atomic financial transactions. New sharing economies. Micro & peer to peer insurance. Collateral & security. Physical world affiliate networks.
Machine to Machine interaction. Drone with a chip flies to a garage, it is recognised as being whitelisted, the garage door opens.

**Everledger**

Provenance means ""the history of something"". It's life story. Is very important for luxury items like artwork.
You may have the expensive thing, but may have misplaced the certificate of authenticity.
Digital global ledger to track items of value.
Currently tacking diamonds (write its unique dimensions, physical properties, faults, etc. gives it a unique ID).
Later if they are stolen and tried to be sold elsewhere, then can grab them.
Currently 98,000 diamonds tracked on their Blockchain.

Can track provenance to track origins of rough diamonds, through to polished stone. To ensure that they don't come from conflict areas.
Can have IoT enabled diamond analysis devices, that can auto get the properties and look up its authenticity in the Blockchain.

**Augur**

http://Augur.net
Prediction platform built on Ethereum.

Would be cool to ask Siri/Cortana a generic question like ""who will win the US presidential candidate will win the US presidency?"".
Predication market works by creating a market on a question. You purchase a share in the prediction, then if you predicted correctly, you get your share of the pool.
""wisdom of the crowd"". The average answer that comes out of a crowd is usually consistently better than an expert.

**Stellar**

International remittances of money transfers are expensive, with long delays. Legacy payment systems are expensive, complicated and slow.

Used to be unreliable to send email to each other, needed to manually specify routes. But SMTP made it a simple open protocol that anyone could use. Why hasn't this been adopted for payments?

Bitcoin allowed sending money as a single network.
They want Stellar to be the protocol to send money from any 2 points, through any payment network. Like Alice pays Bob, but it goes through Bitcoin network, through Dash, then pays Bob in Doge.",24.0,2016-09-24 14:38:22,0.94
Quick update from the ground re transaction spam mitigations,"* Go developers are actively working on client code changes to be able to process Wednesday's attack blocks quickly, see pull request [here](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/3028)

EXTCODECOPYing one byte instead of using EXTCODESIZE)

The current fee for the DoS tx seems to be settled now at 0.027 eth. If a tx is included in a block every 15 sec, this attack is costing 6.48 eth per hour or 155.52 eth per day.   At 2312624, the sum of the balances of the addresses calling the contract (see below) is 150 eth, so expect at least 24 hours of trouble.

**edit:** I guess due to the pools and miners adapting  their gaslimit and gasprice  **the tx fee of the attacker is now up to 0.03465** (+28%)

I had an absolutist mindset about the need of a decentralised source of entropy for gambling to be viable, and while I still have those concerns I accept a case can be made that people can and already do accept private/centralised randomness for such use cases.

> **Event update**

The buzz during the day was around the ""stick puzzle"" that Bok Khoo was giving out to people. It is just a stick, with a loop of string. He gets you to turn away, he uses ""the trick"" to put it onto your bag and then you try to get it off.

The WeChat channel was just filled with everyone asking where they can get it, and the screaming that they can't figure it out. Only about 5 people reported they were able to solve it (I haven't yet)

> **Sessions**

I'm biased, but I thought the announcement from Microsoft with the update of cryptlets was a big deal. The morning sessions covered a few different oracle systems, the afternoon had lots of IPFS sessions.

**Microsoft - A Lap around Cryptlets**

https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/cryptletsdd/
https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/templates/ethereum-consortium-blockchain-network/
https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/author/marleyg

Microsoft was a sponsor of Devcon1 & 2
Ethereum is a 1st class citizen
Support for community & partners - Bizspark, Meetups, Workshops

Announcing:
Bletchley v1
Distributed Ledger stack
V1 is a private Ethrerum consortium, that you can spin up for your own enterprise / group

http://imgur.com/olwwd36

Cryptlets are being developed to help with security, identity, etc.
How do you get trusted external data feeds injected into the Blockchain?
Doing things on a specific interval (every 15 mins)
When price of something hits a threshold (oil goes above $40/barrel)
Secure IP protected algorithms, but still share with blockchain network.
Use libraries for common platforms (.Net, Java, etc)

Cryptlets vs Oracle
Cryptlets will have a marketplace on Azure that will allow you to purchase and utilise

Use case: Trigger on an event
Wake up on 4pm, if market was open that day, then give me the price of gold for that day.Get signature of attested server, attested sender.

Use case: Control
Using smart contract like a traditional DB. Declare data you are keeping track of, and the functions/""stored proc"" to update that data.
Cryptlet runs off chain, and can be scaled up.

http://imgur.com/ysgL8S2

Utility cryptlet. Use an attribute in solidity contract with cryptlet details
Developer references at design time the cryptlet they want the contract to call
Contract cryptlet, deploy the cryptlet at same time as contract.

Why would you want Azure to do this?
SGX allows you to create ""secure enclaves"", can have complete isolation on the hardware chip where it is not modifable.
Provides a secure enclave at the CPU level. Can give full attestation right down to the silicon.
Will be provided as a enclave container on Azure.
Will be released for .NET core CLR first, then other languages.
Can create cryptlet libraries that you can scale and put into the Azure marketplace.
An ecosystem for developers & ISVs to consume and publish.

Bletchley v1 released today will let you spin up a private consortium.
Before today, it took a long time to try and deploy a private consortium (can take weeks to read doco,
Now takes 5 minutes to deploy!
Creates a private consortium, puts each member in its own separate subnet

http://imgur.com/w4yUsqE

Mist Vision and Demo
I was too busy sharing the release posts of Microsoft project bletchey v1, missed this talk.
It did look interesting, I will watch this one later.
Idea: Reward for bandwidth. Providing connection could replace mining as entrance point for desktop computers. Allow you to have a trickle so you can trigger smart contracts.
Standardised backends, so that you can swap out the underlying node between geth, blockapps, etc.

**Web3.js**

https://github.com/ethereum/web3.js
Etehereum JS API
Smart conracts are EVM opcodes,
Helps translates calls to JSON RPC calls. Helps do the ABI encoding when sending data from JS to EVM
It kept on growing, many different utility functions being thrown in. Is time to clean it up and be refactored.

They are now building a NEW web3.js
The communication will be socket based, will enable subscriptions. Everything will be based on promises to subscribe to events, like log events.
Bunch of other newer cleaner methods and ways to do things like deploying contracts.

**Smart contract security**

Was a very good postmorteum of The DAO and things that could be done to mitigate it in the future.

An issue with The DAO was trying to do a massive jump from centralisation all the way to full decentralisation. Meant no one could step up and make a decision on how to save it. We need to make smaller steps towards full decentralisation as we learn as a community how to do this.
Same security patterns as yesterday's talks: check invarients, beware 1024 call stack depth, reentry exploit (update state BEFORE executing calls), timestamps are manipulatable.
Updateable contracts. Who can update it? Community multisig?
We need better rools: formal verification, compiler warnings, improved IDEs, trusted libraries, excape hatches

Conclusion: It is still very early days in this space, be careful.

**A Provably Honest Oracle Model: Auditable Offchain Data Gathering & Computations**

Oracalize is the most widely used oracle (until everyone starts using Microsoft Azure cryptlets ;-) )
Contract calls Oracalize contract with the data they want, off chain they see this get the data, Oracalise then trigger their contract externally, which does a callback to your contract with the data.
Can use external notary servers.
Can get proof from multiple external services to get a higher level of confidence about data (e.g. stock price from a few feeds).
Off-chain (auditable_ computation)
AWS sandbox 2.0.
Put the execution package onto IPFS, AWS gets it and executes it, signs it.

**iEx.ec: Fully Distributed Cloud Thanks to the Ethereum Blockchain**

http://iex.ec/  
Provides blockchain based execution environments
Global market for computing resources.
Idea is to do what we did before with ""grid computing"" use the idle capacity of computers. But this time do a trickle of micropayments. Allows people to harness this global power to execute their tasks in a global ""distributed cloud"".

**The Final frontier: The company smart conract**

http://otonomos.com/
Helping companies to incorporate on the blockchain.

**Smart oracles**

https://github.com/smartoracles
Connecting to external resources is difficult. Hard to try and use external currencies (like a bank account / fiat money) to make transactions. Could hook in paypal, HSBC, wells fargo, etc.
Can provide your own payment services as an API to a smart oracle for smart contracts to consume.
Do off chain data storage by calling smart oracle API
Roadmap: more data sources & more payment methods

**IPFS & Ethereum: Updates**

https://Ipfs.io  
IPFS is AMAZING, seriously go watch the full 1 hour talks Juan has given in previous years.

Current web has current issues. Centralisation, etc.
IPFS is a new hypermedia transfer protocol
Content can be retrieved not from specific servers, but instead via it's hash so that it can come from anywhere in the network (maybe from the person next to you who has cached it).
It is highly modular, all of the transfer protocals, routing, naming, etc. are all swapable
Is available as GO-IPFS & now JS-IPFS
Means now you can run IPFS in the browser
IPFS was great for static content, but not so great for dynamic content. Low latency pub/sub protocol will help with dynamic data.
Created a distributed peer to peer chat app using this new dynamic content protocol.
IPLD a common link-tree hash format
Will be able to use IPFS to retrieve ethereum blockchain blocks DIRECTLY
Can use IPFS as a package manager to retrieve them in a distributed manner.

Many projects are using Ethereum & IPFS Uport, Digix, Infura, Ujo, Eris, Blockfreight.
Filecoin was created as a way to try and incentivize nodes to keep files longer time.
People rent out hdd space to earn filecoin. Exchange bitcoin/filecoin. Use filecoin to store files in network.
Filecoin is going to be built on top of the public Ethereum blockchain, as a virtual blockchain / token.

**IPFS Libp2p & Ethereum networking**

Network connectivity between any 2 nodes can be difficult. Censorship, bandwidth, network issues, etc.
Having to deal with different networking topologies and access.
Libp2p & Devp2p is different. Devp2p is for Ethereum. LIbp2p is modular, can swap out components to change network access, encryption methods, etc.
Can build up a MEGA mesh network, by utilising traditional wired internet, radio, bluetooth between some nodes.
Web browser using web socket, to a node, which routes across network, to zigbee to a IoT device.
Libp2p & Devp2p could merge and augment each other. Could create the libp2p components to replace the devp2p bits
Any 2 nodes that speak the same protocol can communicate and be a part of the network chain.
Experiment. They took the browser based version of EVM. Then used Libp2p to talk to the Ethereum network. Had a complete ethereum node running in a browser.

**Uport**

https://uport.me/
Universal identity platform
Current challenges: key management. Ux for average person. Dapps via mobile. Identity and data ownership.
How do you keep a consistent identity, even if you lose a key.
Have some multisig contracts that you can use to keep track.
Social recovery, use your friends to attest it is really you.
Keep private key on mobile, do transactions on the desktop, scan a QR code to sign the transaction on your phone and send it off.

**A Deep Dive into the Colony Foundation Protocol**

It is an open source governance protocol built on Ethereum
Problem with voting is how to prevent Sybil attacks.
Votes are weighted by a reputation score.
Reputation is non-transferable that can only be earned.
Total weighted voting helps mitigate this.

**Chain orchestration tooling & smart contract package management**

Eris is tooling for developers.
Package manager to build your own blockchain.
Can compose a chain, e.g. geth + tendermint consensus.
Init, install, do.
Can easily install on Mac/bew, linux/apt-get, Windows/choco

**The Golem Project: Ethereum-based market for computing power**

http://www.golemproject.net/
Anyone can make an offer to sell computing power. e.g. Distributed rendering
Want to create a standard framework that anyone can use to submit and process jobs.

**Status: Integrating Ethereum Into Our Daily Lives**

https://status.im
Want to get ethereum everywhere. ""Mist for Mobile""
Everyone is using their mobile phones for everything, but mostly using instant messaging.
What would Ethereum in a IM window look?
Created a IM mobile app that has a local geth node. tart up, it asks you to create a password, it generates a pub/private pair.
Then can send messages via whisper, and the messages are signed with your public key.
Can load Dapps up in the local webview and interact with them.
Allows you to create ""chat Dapps"", that you interact with via text. Like chatbots

**Maker Ecosystem Overview**

www.Makerdao.com
Dai: seeking stability on blockchain.
Stablecoin engine: smart contract that holds collateral reserves and controls the Dai lifecycle.
MKR: open source community managing risk of the system
In the last year, investing in a solid technical core. More slow and audit things. Moving into the next phase of stablecoin development.
Their latest project is the ""Simplecoin project""
Meeting Thereum community's need for stability. An independent platform for creating centrally administered simple stablecoins.
Issues create their own rule sets: Collateral types, participant whitelists, security parameters.
Example: Shrutebucks. The only people who own it are Dwight, Jim & Pam. They backed it with 1/3 ETH 1/3 DGX 1/3 DUSD.

**Orbit. A distributed peer to peer app on IPFS**

https://github.com/haadcode
Created a full distributed chat room, itself distributed through IPFS.
It is integrated with uPort for identification
Using uPort allows you to verify that you are talking to the correct person in the chat channel. All their messages are signed with their public keys
He also created a full distribited twitter clone, using uport for the identity as well.
Orbit-db key value store DB that stores its data on IPFS. Eventually consistent
Appends data to the DB, an event is sent to those subscribed on pub/sub so they can see the latest root hash. Based on CRDT
Ethereum + Pubsub + CRDTs + IPFS = super power primatives to build dynamic distributed apps

Development considerations with distributed apps.
Need to ensure that apps work offline.
No centralised servers.
No data silos.
Provide integration path.

Future work: could you use uPort for ACL like permissions?
Mobile use cases, how to make it work nicely on mobiles

**Building scalable React Dapp architecture**

https://github.com/SilentCicero/react-dapp-boilerplate
React + Ethereum
He has a configured boilerplate template.
Has contract scaffolding. Enforced contract Linting/testing. Wallet generation/identity. Preconfigured web3 instance.
UI: Mature react arhitecture ""react boilerplate"". Prices listed in USD with ETH/btc via kraken api. A basic multi-contract example Dapp. Offline first, dapp runs without internet.
Uses Redux. State models in UI & blockchains work well.
PostCSS, CSS Modules, sanitize.cs. Redux, immutableJS, reslect, redux-saga, i18n, redux-router.
Web3, ethdeploy, dapple, solium, eth-lightwallet, chaithereum, ethereumjs0-testrpc
Enforced contract testing in 2 languages.

**Ethereum for Enterprise (BlockApps Strato)**

Trying to make sure that Ethereum stays relevent to enterprise development.
Why do you need a blockchain WITHIN an org, shouldn't they trust each other? Well different departments may not, they may reconcile differently, and can help automate/orchestrate between them.
Blockchain is the ""killer app"" for cloud financial services. Legacy infrastructure, batch prossing, etc are all restricting fintech from progressing. Blockchain can happen in real time, can replace legacy.
Ethereum is very flexible and programmable, works well. There are others based on Bitcoin (like Hyperledger).
Ethereum + Blockapps = Extreme productivity + Proven Technology.
Blockapps is extending Ethereum for Enterprise.
Runs very well on Azure
Enterprises don't want all their data exposed on public chain. Blockapps helps solve data privacy and scaling with multichain fabrics.",73.0,2016-09-21 17:16:38,0.96
Vitalik: PoS is not suitable for gambling,"Update:
I no longer think this title is fair and I made a mistake. My sincere apologies. Please see https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/543loa/correction_vitalik_did_not_say_pos_is_not/
--------------------------------

I've been discussing proof of stake over on the research Gitter.

Basically, PoS has a fundamental problem - there is no external source of entropy. Entropy is what is required to get ""randomness"", and is incredibly important from a security perspective.

The best solution the developers have is a RANDAO, but it involves compromise.

The way RANDAO works is that validators must each decide on a random value. They then submit evidence that they have picked a random value without disclosing what it is.

When it is their turn to create a block they must provide the value and a proof to show they haven't manipulated it, otherwise they face a penalty. The value they provide will be used to generate randomness for that block (and determine the outcome of any gambling relying on randomness, such as a dice game or lottery).

This creates a problem. If you get a validator who has say 20% of the staking power in a shard (though the problem exists at any level of stake), then they will be responsible for creating approximately 1 in 5 blocks.

If any validator is allocated to a shard that contains gambling contracts, they will be able to see this and they will be able to place bets.

If it is their turn to create a block and they realise the random value they generated will lead to an unfavourable outcome for bets they have placed, they can skip their turn, take the penalty, and identify they have a better chance of winning money if somebody else creates the next block with a different random value.

This process would enable validators to gain an edge in ANY gambling contracts. The higher the stake the higher the edge, which is a centralising pressure in itself.

It would be possible to build algorithm that can identify gambling contracts when a validator is allocated to a shard, and to automatically generate and execute betting strategies that should give the validator an edge and return a profit.

Ultimately, a compromise of PoS, is that it is not suitable for gambling, or any use cases that rely strongly on randomness.

In the gitter discussion the attitude to this revelation was very laid back, Vitalik ""yes, so the casper randao is NOT suitable for high value gambling use cases"" and others “I don't see the problem, you could just not use RANDAO for these use cases”.

This means there will likely always be a rival blockchain, powered by PoW (which provides an external source of entropy) where all gambling activity takes place, since there is huge demand for such services.

The development team seem happy that gambling use cases will need to find another home than Ethereum. Will losing all gambling contracts to other blockchains prove an Achilles heel in adoption?",48.0,2016-09-21 11:08:17,0.72
I want to accept Ethereum on my online store. How can I do that?,I'm using BitPay for Bitcoin. I want similar clear simple solution. Which one is the best? Thanks.,46.0,2016-09-21 09:41:57,0.92

`

> **Sessions**

Lots of formal verification sessions in the morning. The afternoon was more dev tools. I was excited about Truffle

**Smart contract security**

Showed the 1 line mistake that caused The DAO re-entry attack.
Pro tip: tag your untrusted accounts in the contract. e.g. Name the variable something like _untrusted_account
https://github.com/Consensys/smart-contract-best-practices
https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/Safety

Prepare for failure. Be aware that unknown exploits can be found. Put in escape hatches / kill switches
Roll out carefully and test ""The strongest swords are forged by continuously putting them in the fire""
External calls to other contracts: Try to avoid calling untrusted contracts (one written by someone else). It only takes 1 mistake in an external contract to expose you. Either from a bug, or from your external contract then calling another malicious contract.
Use send(), avoid call.value()()
Handle errors in raw calls. Raw calls do not propogate exceptions.  e.g. if(!address.send())
An attacker could construct a call to max out the call stack, so that when your contract tries to make any calls they fail.
Favour PULL over PUSH for payments

**Visualising Security**

https://github.com/Raineorshine/solgraph
How can you spot smart contract vulnerabilities
Static analysis can help analyse the code without executing it (like checking for null, then using a variable anyway). Builds up an AST (Abstract Syntax Tree) which can be explored.
Created solgraph to do this
Dynamic analysis is done by running unit tests (e.g. you can use the Ruby test runner from yesterday's presentation)

**Ethereum Security Overview**

Can try to manage risk by reducing the likelihood or impact.
Security concerns include things like wallets, gaming the system, denial of service

End users wallets isolation: Can reduce your impact by using a hot wallet with a small amount in it. Cold wallets to hold more of it securely
There are some hardware based wallets can help secure your wallets
Then frozen wallets to keep them offline.
Ethereum valut by @Arachnid. Multi sig wallets can help reduce the likelihood

Contracts: When calling another contract, if they use randomness WHERE do they source it from? Can it be gamed? Can anyone access it before you?
Sybil attacks (attacker using multiple identities) to game against you
Can anyone rage quit and lock up the contract by not interacting with it any more

DAPPS: 
Use HTTPS, BUT DO NOT USE CDNs
Someone could inject malicious JS that will modify your DAAP and redirect payments to another address.
Have an upgrade path (for both code and data).
Check invariants, use escape hatches / emergency breaks
Many potential contract vulnerabilities (see previous talks)
Favour PULL over PUSH for payments

**Formal verification for Solidity**

Writing code correctly is hard.  It is easy to test for desired behaviour (the happy path). Hard to check absence of undesired behaviour.
Formal verification can help find undesired behaviour.
The specifications are usually compiled down to why3 or f*
Showed a Why3 GUI that shows your code and highlights lines that are not passing (e.g. because a line doesn't satisfy the conditions that it can't integer overflow.

Microsoft released a research paper allowing the conversion of Solidity & EVM code to f*.

**Parity's innovations**

Written in Rust (type safe. Memory safe).
Is modular, you can tweak it or use preset config files.  High transaction throughput. Low latency. Low footprint (suitable for IoT devices).
Unsafe APIs are disabled be default.
Advanced eafutures like state trie pruning (redued disk space) snapshotting, warp sync, private chains including PoA

Imandra Contracts: Formal Verification for Ethereum
Completely tuned out for this. It was very much like a sales pitch, just talking itself up.

**Ether.camp annual summary**

Released Ethereum Studio. Is available on Azure as an easily deployable Virtual Machine https://azure.microsoft.com/en-in/documentation/templates/ethereum-studio-docker-standalone-ubuntu/
Will help you write unit tests. Spin it up, execute, tear down.
A partnership with Santander. Ethereum Cash. You can tie an Ethereum account to a bank account. More info at http://www.coindesk.com/santander-vies-become-first-bank-issue-digital-cash-blockchain/ 
Created a virtual accelerator hack.ether.camp

**Metamask - Bridging ethereum to browsers**

Ease of adoption is their core goal
User flow. You download, generate a vault (with a deterministic keyphrase).
Enter phone number, credit card details, and you can get Ether directly into your metamask account.
Done 33 releaes. 12k users.
Extension currently runs on chrome. Is ready to be pushed to opera, firefox & Edge
RPC requests to a trusted node. Intercepts the RPC calls within the DAPP to redirect to Metamask
Feature Requests: Multiple account types (e.g. uPort, remote key stores), make the browser a light client

**Building the Light Client Ecosystem**

Quick sync (up to 0k headers/sec) 30 secs - 5mins for a full sync (dependant on CPU)
Low resource requirements (DB <100mb, RAM < 500mb)
RPC interface compatibile with full nodes. Mist already works with it
Because light clients rely on full nodes and put higher workload on them, there are some thoughts about having a basic throttled ""free"" service, and a paid priority system that will give more resources.
There are difficult future concerns around scalability. In a future sharded world, may need multiple full nodes to cover all the shards.
Future work: do complex operations on server side. Define a ""SuperCM"" that can answer any question about the chain. Generalised off chain computing for accessing data.

**Import Geth: Ethereum from Go and beyond**

Geth is one of the 3 origin clients. Evolved throughout the Ethereum prototyping. Needed to include everhtying to develop on top. Followed the Geth -> Mist -> Dapps architecture.
Using Geth as a library isn't a good option at the moment. has started to collect technical debt, from prototypes being rapidly iterated on.
Geth 1.5 is a concentrated effort to make Geth a library. Client side account management, Remote node APIs, native bindings to contracts, in-process ethereum client
Chain exploration, state querying and event subscription over IPC, HTTP or WebSocket.
Native contracts. Can generate a Ethereum ABI GO binding that GO code can use? Can create a solidity wrapper for go?
In process nodes lets you hose a node within your app. Saves you telling someone to ""please go and install an ethereum node"".
What about supporting this on iOS & Android? Geth 1.3 already ran on mobile platforms. Released an embeddable library in Dec 2015, but is really a proof of concept. Mobile in-process nodes. Easier to call API locally now.

**Developing Scalable Decentralized Applications for Swarm & Ethereum**

Web 2.0 has issues around scaling & centralised control.
When moving to Web 3.0 we need a general purpose distributed backend (swarm/bzz). Said there MAY be interoperability with IPFS. They hope that it will share a lot of the underlying principals with IPFS. I HOPE this happens! Well leverage network effects from IPFS.
Logic being pushed to clients (logic in JS in browser, in native mobile 

Swarm high level API.
URL begins with the collection root hash (like IPFS)  bzz://<crypto hash>/imgs/example.jpg
Can do root hash registration to a friendly name (like IPFS's IPNS) bzz://some.friendly.name/imgs/example.jpg
Put static and dynamic data within swarm. Put global state changes onto the blockchain. Local client side only state changes can be stored locally (and optionally backed up to blockchain/swarm)
Execute logic locally, but verify it on chain.

Example Dapp Distributed photo album. Webapp resources & data hosted in swarm. Current root hash of collections published to blockchain.
Optimised image, thumbnails, etc. are generated client side before uploading (just like facebook, etc. do)
Possibility to instead do delegated computation, put the files in swarm, get someone else to process it.

**Dapple Dev Workflow**

https://github.com/nexusdev/dapple
https://github.com/nexusdev/dappsys
Dapple looks like a critical thing to integrate into your development suite! If you are into devops, I definitely recommend watching this vid later to see how you could integrate testing flows.
http://Dapphub.io
EVM Dev Multitool for helping with Dapp developments. Has EVM extensions
Has a shared data model ""Dappfile"". Is a package/dapp descriptor format.
Shared global runtime environment blurs line between code packages & deployed code objects.
Can chain fork, to help you when testing contracts.
Can find dependencies. Custom linker
Test harness to use a contract to test other contracts
Use the chain forking in your tests. Take live chain, fork, insert your test contract, fork before you call each test method.
Deploy: Wallet side scripting. Hijacks call and create, and redirects to side chains. So you can do some dry runs.

**Solidity for Dummies**

Solidity is a higher level language. Looks like Javascript, but with types. Shame they didn't just use TypeScript ;-) Maybe Solidity 2.0 can migrate to using TypeScript.
Solidity is compiled to EVM. Once it is in the EVM it is isloated.
Public functions are callable by anybody. That is your contract public surface area / exposed APIs.
Contract standards are beginning to emerge e.g. ERC20 interface for tokens. Having a standard for token meant that the community can do cool things, like etherscan.io that lets you look up tokens in the block chain, or EtherEx that is a decentralised token exchange.
Lots of IDEs & tools you can use with solidity. Ethereum Studio, Visual Studio, Vim. Solgraph, truffle, dapple, embark.

Getting started guide https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/4ws9um/rethereum_rules_and_getting_started_guide/


**New and future features of Solidity**

Initial goals of solidity: statically typed. Easily readable. High level. Uses little gas.
What has happened in the last year? Build custom types. Internal library functions. Source mapping via AST, for solidity code to EVM, assists with debugging.
Future: Formal verification. Authenticated sources & binaries via swarm. Templates. Functions as 1st class citizen. New notation for parallel / async programs

**How to create advanced Dapps using embark**

Compatible with any build pipeline
Supports contracts TDD using Javascript
Manages deployed contracts, deploys only when needed (and dependent contracts)
Manages different chanes (e.g. testnet, pribate net, livenet)
Support for both Solidity and Serpent
Contract instances, like inheritence.
Embark 2 goals. Facilitate communication between contracts. A cool dashboard, shows which contracts have been deployed, available services (geth whisper, IPFS)
EmbarkJS futures: promises and named parameters. Automatic type conversion. Communication abstraction, allows you to plug in supported providers like whisper, etc. Storage abstraction provider (swarm, etc.)

**Truffle Development Ecosystem and Future of Ethereum Development Tools** 

http://truffleframework.com/
https://github.com/ConsenSys/truffle

Truffle is the most widely used Ethereum development framework. 17k+ downloads
In v1 Compiliation, deployment, bootstrapping, abstractions, unit testing, quick development. In v2 Network management, Migrations, Modularity, Documentation.
Going towards Truffle v3
Ethereumjs-testrpc allows instant mining, account creation, HD wallet support, deterministic. Allows you to fork from any available chain, for a new development chain (sounds like chain forking in Dapple). Take the live chain, fork it, then try developing against contracts in the live net on your dev fork.
Solidity unit testing
Npm integratoin ""npm install my-package"". Import sol contracts.
Webpack integration.
Ether-pudding allows you wo watch for events.
Futures: Solidity 0.4 support, better network management, more integrations, more boilerplate, more tutorials.

**ENS: Ethereum (Domain) Name System**

Why do we need ""yet another name service"". To allow you to name wallets, files, etc on top of Swarm & IPFS.
Existing name servies are ironically centralised within a single place or contract.

What makes a good name service? Separation of concerns, distributed authority, forward compatibility, efficient on-chain resolution.
Components: Registrars, ENS Registry, Resolvers.
ENS Registry maps the name (hack.eth, nick.hack.eth) to the resolver
Resolver is a simple contract that lets you set the address for a name, look up names, etc.
Registrars, let people be in charge of a TLD (.eth) and then allow people to register under them (automatically through a smart contract).
Initially an auction based registration. Only names under .eth are available.

**Making Smart Contracts Smarter: Oyente**

https://github.com/ethereum/oyente
Smart contracts == one-shot programs. Self executed, cannot patch. Solidity is similar but not the same as Javascript.
Original contract code is not always available (but the new solidity feature of putting onto swarm may fix this).
Too many smart contracts to manually decompile EVM and check them all.
Oyente is a new analyzer for smart contracts. Use cymbolic executions. Detects all popular bugs TOD (transaction ordering dependence), Timestamp dependence, re-entrancy, mishandling exceptions.
TOD: Observed state != execution state. The state may change between when you submit a transaction and it is executed. Someone can watch transactions being submitted looking for a critical execution, could quickly snipe and enter your own transaction into the transaction pool as well with a higher fee to try and get yours executed before the other person.
Timestamps: Can be manipulated by miners.
Oyente Symbolic execution. Can build a tree of every branch and possible execution and run over it.
Can detect bugs, test generation, and go over all possible paths.

**Beyond the Bubble**

Overcoming education and adoption challenges for the Blockchain industry.
He is a technical evangelist for blockchain. Last month went and spoke to US gov to advise FBI, CIA, etc.
Wants to help grow the blockchain beyond just us very early adopters.
Fintech is rapidly developing blockchain solutions.
IoT, energy & medical are looking towards adoption.
Longer term, governments & non profits.

Why do normal people care?
Internet still functions off 1970s tech: Our data is sent in plaintext, leaked by companies, our identities are stolen by hackers, our behaviour is mined and monetized by advertisers.
People are beginning to understand the need to have same privacy and security guarantees online as they do offline.
Things should be encrypted by default. ""Own your own data""

**Infura. Ethereum & IPFS infrastructure**

https://infura.io/
How do devs ensure that users have access to Ethereum & IPFS. How to make it easier for users to jump in.
Didn't show anything. Just talked (only had 10 mins). There was a services called Ferryman that can talk to the IPFS/Ethereum network.
Apparently being used by Metamask, uport, regis, truffle.

**Testing Ethereum Consensus**

There are HEAPS of ethereum clients (Geth, Parity, etc). How can we ensure that they all come to the same consensus?
By using a suite of tests. State tests, Blockchain tests,
http://ethdocs.org/en/latest/contracts-and-transactions/ethereum-tests/

**CarbonVote: A Gauge for Human Consensus**

http://Carbonvote.com
""Machines serves human. Carbon over silicion. Consensus from community"". (use people to make a decision, not computers). Machine consensus is just a tool for human consensus.

**Sikorka – Ethereum meets the Outdoors**

A system that facilities deploying smart contracts in real world locations.
Enables smart contracts to interface with environment.
Provide ""proof of presence"" that a user is indeed in correct location.
Potential uses: loyalty programs offering discounts to people visiting specific locations.
Proving attendance in a location for official purposes e.g. administrative, corporate, AR games.
Proof or Presence: using mobile phones and software - geolocation data (can be spoofed) use a challenge question (e.g. what is the last word on a monument's plaque). Scannable QR codes, RFID tags, beacons.
Sikorka works  by deploying contracts that follow a specific interface. Interaction with contract only happens after PoP.

**Remix and Other Ethereum Development Tools**

https://github.com/ethereum/remix
smart contract debugging
Is a NPM module. Looks very early stage. Says it can be integrated into other tools like Dapple, truffle, ethereum studio, Visual Studio, etc.).

**Mango: Git Completely Decentralized**

https://Github.com/axic/mango
Git on Ethereum, IPFS & Swarm
Harder to take down a central repo (e.g. Github)
Proof of existence for source coode. Ethereum is a decentralised system. Its source code should be available in a decentralised manner.
Using IPFS or Swarm, the files are chunked up and stored. So if you have a large file that only changes a few bytes, it can de-dupe and only store the chunks with differences.
Git is a merkle tree. IPFS/Swarm directly store as a merkle tree/dag
(There are some good talks by Juan Bennet from IPFS talking about how you can do this)

Naïve implementation, store everything in a contract on a blockchain, would cost 50M ether

Useful implementation, store objects in IPFS or Swarm to store the data off chain. Then map the IPFS identifies to git identifiers. Save those identifiers on the blockchain so you know what to look up.

Hook it up so that a git push updates the commit hash to contract, then pushes to IPFS. Reduces gas cost to 140,000 down from 5m
Every git repo has its own contract.
Future work could let you expose your git repo via ENS (Ethereum Name Service) e.g. solidity.ethereum.mango.eth
Future of Mango: store release notes within git. Store issues within git. Store pull requests. Create user friendly web frontends",62.0,2016-09-20 15:37:13,0.93
Confusion : should I download MIST or Ethereum Wallet from github?,and what is the difference anyway? https://github.com/ethereum/mist/releases/tag/0.8.3,29.0,2016-09-20 14:07:12,0.87
"Devcon2 In Brief: ""Cash Eth"" Just Announced!","Roman Mandeleil (ether.camp) took to the stage to announce ""Cash Eth""! This allows you to link an Ethereum address with your official Santander bank account. This is a world first as far as we're concerned. Huge step forward not just for Ethereum, but for cryptocurrency in general. Very bold move by Santander!

Cash Eth is currently running on Ethereum Morden (test) network. It's ""a working system on the test network"". They are ""going to take it live"" soon. In the mean time, there's a sandbox available on ether.camp where you can go and build your own products. 

Cash Eth was VERY well recieved by audience here. Lots of cheering!!!

Ledgerwatch's personal update from DEVCON2,"It has been a long day...
I wish I had a bigger breakfast, because I was starving by the time of the first coffee break.

Most of the things I saw were kind of things I read somewhere, apart of the following (I either missed them of they weren't known):

1. Swarm has 100+ node test network on Azure

2. Swarm is generalising the notion of Judge out of their SWindle litigation protocol

3. Vlad went ""back to basics"" and presented a provably safe way to achieve agreement on 1 bit (every Validator produces an estimate of single Boolean value) with Casper ""bets"". He also went ""back"" to FLP impossibility result, with their proof based on bivalent configurations, and applied similar thing to proving safety in Casper (if it is possible to prove that only an incorrect bet can change the estimate of a validator, given arbitrary adversary). Safety does not imply liveliness, therefore his work is still bound by FLP impossibility, but if you assume censorship resistance (essentially limiting the adversary), it can still work.

4. Transpiling EVM code into WebAssemply is a very cool idea, because one can then run EVM natively in most modern browsers. With far reaching consequences.

5. Raiden network generalised to support any ERC20 tokens, and presented a cool demo with an electricity meter, and switch controlled by a payment channel.

6. Zcash will launch on the 28th of October. I need to find out what is the mining like.

Perhaps I missed a few things, but this seems to cover new things for me.

P.S. if anyone wants to find me, I seem to be the only person wearing trouser braces (aka suspenders).

P.P.S. Technology-wise, everything just worked for me - my sim works in roaming, i've got WiFi in the room, Google and Gmail work too, as well as everything else I use.. without VPNs.",41.0,2016-09-19 22:38:05,0.86

Fahrt nach Hause
from Max_312 sent an hour ago

Hi was trying to comment on your post in the ""Ethermine Currently unter dos attack"" thread, but reddit wont let me, because I have just created my account. Could you post on my behalf?:
I am the one who send ""Fahrt nach Hause"". I am just playing around with Ethereum in preparation for my actual ethereum project. I dont believe that my transaction caused the crash and someone from Ethereum has confirmed this to me (thank god)
That the phrase fits so perfectly is just a weird coincidence. And actually the interpretation is not quite accurate. Yes, the text can mean ""go home"", but in this case I was referring to an actual journey home, as in ""a ride home"". Although the dark humor was just coincidence, feel free to tip me aswell, you all know my ethereum address already :-P
As soon as I get my geth client running again, I can proove that I have control over that account.
would be much appreciated.",20.0,2016-09-19 20:26:02,0.78

**WeChat update**

The WeChat groups were still forked (Devcon2 vs DEVCON2). However it now looks like everyone is adopting the longer DEVCON2 chain (272 vs 134). Recommendation: The groups are at capacity, so ask someone in person to just add you to the DEVCON2 group.

` 

> **VENUE & AMENITIES**

DEVCON2 is happening in Shanghai on the famous bund river. It looks beautiful at night http://imgur.com/i5SGbL4

There were people doing Taichi exercises in the lobby for show http://imgur.com/Q33eHka

All of the hotel conference helper staff were Chinese women that were wearing these lovely dresses http://imgur.com/z9QuPVT

The quality of the food during the breaks and lunch time was extremely high quality (was too busy eating to take photos) http://imgur.com/AeAU9uQ

The only negative was the hiccup in the morning for registration. There was a line form 8am, at 9am not even 1/2 the people had managed to be registered, so the conference start had to be pushed back 1/2 an hour http://imgur.com/AeAU9uQ

`

> **SESSIONS**

http://imgur.com/Z2b2Q3V

**Dapp regulations**

Speaker was from Coin Center
Talking about the potential risks of Dapps / cryptocurrencies being classified as ""securities"", which could get you into trouble with the US gov FCC.
Coin / token presales can get you into trouble as that can look like a security. There are ways to structure the technology and language to avoid to help keep you safer. Peter said you can contact him if you want to try and do a safer presale 
Peter(at)cooncebter.org

**Panel**

Generic talks of EVMs that were expanded on much more in later talks

**Directions in Smart Contract Research: A Selection**

From IC3
Hackers can try and exploit bugs to earn financial benefit
Try and mitigate with formal specification & verification. Lots of research going into this in the Ethereum world right now. Use escape hatches to try and protect your contact against unforeseen bugs. Bug bounties can help


**Incentive system for Swarm**

Peer to peer file sharing for Dapps. Has been upstreamed to develop branch 
Talked about different contracts (SWAP / SWEAR / SWINDLE) that get nodes to pay and be paid for file retrieval and long term storage.

I'm still unsure why we need swarm
Why aren't we just using IPFS for the storage/transfer, and just putting SWAP over the top for the incentive system. Then it would get wider network effects from the greater IPFS web.
Also saves reinventing the wheel. Seems like ""not invented here"" syndrome. 


**Making the EVM scream**

Made some tweaks to variable types, etc. to get some more performance. Showing benchmarks that it is faster. Same content as previous blog post
TL;DR it is faster and they want to make faster


**Raiden network**

They have a working prototype. Will be available ""soon"".
Should make transactions instant and lower the cost of transactions, and help with transaction privacy. 
Showed a demo of an IoT scenario. Consuming energy consumed tokens. Periodically during consumption it would record a transaction (was about once a second), which transferred the tokens instantly, keeping the energy flowing, until the tokens ran out
Goal is to create a general framework to build off chain Dapps


**Truebit: Trying to Fool a Blockchain**

Ethereum is awesome because it is Turing complete.
Means smart contracts could in theory analyse solidity code, improve itself, compile the new solidity contract, deploy new improved contracts, etc.
But too expensive to do computations on chain, so instead you can get things calculated off chain. But how to do it securely?
Created a proof of concept. Is secured by the ""verification game"", where someone submits result, someone can challenge. But the honest person will ALWAYS win.


**Towards Web3 infrastructure**

Swarm for peer to peer files.  Again it sounds like they are reinventing IPFS. They should just let IPFS worry about that infrastructure, and should instead focus on the incentive structure on top. 
Whisper is a cool messaging system. Could be used to do streaming video content


**Ethcore - building the distributed future** 

Showing off Parity client UI. It is a clean room implementation of the Ethereum client written in Rust.
Parity will host its client as a Web UI (http://localhost:5000)
Looks like a more fly featured version of local Mist wallet. The best feature is that using other tokens (e.g. DAO tokens, Gavcoin) are treated as 1st class citizen in the UI like ETH, makes it easier to interact and trade with
http://imgur.com/T0Iii0h http://imgur.com/KCINbR9 http://imgur.com/jq5KysS


**State channels. Making your application practical**

Very clean short explanation of state channels. Watch it if you don't understand how they work.  

**Ethereum loves Web assembly**

https://github.com/ewasm
EVM is the core of ethereum.
EVM has had some growing pains.
Want to rewrite it using Web assembly technology, can vastly improve execution due to the Web Assembly execution engine within browsers.
eWASM (ethereum web assembly).
Restricted subset of an web assembly VM.
Backwards compat with EVM 1.
Has a tool EVM2WASM to can transpile EVM code to very fast web assembly.
Allows extensibility, like putting metering off to the side of execution.
eWASM ethereum exexution interface definition.  Defines ~29 instructions.
eWASM contract Interface ECI. Defines structure of a contact. 


**Casper**

To move us from PoW to PoS.
Goal of consensus protocols is to make all nodes make the same decision if they follow the protocol.
Asynchronous consensus is REALLY difficult. 
Nodes that are behaving badly and not following protocol are Byzantine.
1/3 the talk was spent just defining terms like safety, estimates, approach motivation.
Rest of session he spoke too fast and kept clicking next to flick through slides (60 slides in 20 mins). Wasn't able to catch the information at all . 

**Ethereum on ruby**

EVM written in ruby
Wrote a testing framework called teth. Means the tests can be run in memory in ruby EVM
Let's you write tests with multiple actors to test complex interactions. 
Alice executes a contact. Bob does something else. Check the state. 

**Zcash loves ethereum**

https://ethereumfoundation.org/devcon/?session=zcash-private-transactions-on-a-public-blockchain
Bunch of cryptography researchers came up with some new insights. All became founders of zcash. Focused on privacy of transactions.
Zcash will be released as its own blockchain 
3 ways to combine privacy & programmability
	1. Add privacy to Ethereum. Baby ZoE (zcash on ethereum)
	2. Add progamability to the zcash blockchain
	3. Connect zcash & ethereum blockchain. Project alchemy
Project alchemy: verify zcash's PoW in solidity. 
Zrelay. 
Smart contacts to fulfil orders. 
do a trustless swaps of coins.
Would enable ethereum contacts to send & receive zcash. Means they could do transactions more privately.
Zcash launches Oct 28

**Types for tokens**

New kinds of typing disciplines that allow you to detect behavioural errors. 
Can help with formal verification systems, and drastically reduce the cost 
Talked about types as being pluggable components (sounds like interface based programming)
Rholang is a blockchain based social contacting language with behavioural typing mechanism. 
It can detect deadlocks and race conditions at compile time. If you convert The DAO contact into rolang you can see the race condition

**Ethereum for Resource-Limited Devices
**
Getting ethereum onto mobiles, wearables and resource constrained devices. 
Multiple threads of progress being made to reduce requirements. Runs on a Rpi model A

**Designs for the L4 Contract Programming Language Based on Deontic Modal Logic**

https://Legalese.com
Developing a DSL for lawyers to generate verified contacts.
Like SQL for writing contacts.
Will compile your contacts to English PDFs.


**The Mauve Revolution**

Ethereum is currently ""slow"", doesn't scale. Wastes lots of electricity woth PoW.
Rather than spend $1000 on physical mining hardware & electricity, instead do virtual mining.  Use the $1000 to virtual mine by staking.
Uses a Casper smart contract. You register yourself as a validator.

Devcon2 Impressions from the first day,"It is amazing how fast some guys are talking and therefore thinking on a stage (Vitalik included and actually leading the race)

Just in one day, we were introduced in depth how Ethereum is addressing the scalability problem. With actually three approaches, if I got it right. 

Vitalik and Vlad are working on two different versions of Casper. 

Then Heiko with Raiden is about to launch the off-chain way of doing things fast.

And then Swap, Swear, Swarn (presented by Viktor Thron) is a fast way to deliver the content from the network.

Alltogether it does look like there is a vision how to create the web 3.0 and the things are moving to this direction.

Finally, the part with incredible Dr, Greg Golvin was ... just .. I don't know, difficult to find the words. The man is indeed the most cool among all of them (ok, may be except Vitalik)",43.0,2016-09-19 14:51:40,0.93
Attack on Ethereum proof that your work is great !,"We follow Ethereum project since a good time now, and this network look more attacked than other (?), certainly cause it is new and all new project have things to correct, but also cause project is great! A useless project never be attacked so much cause they is nothing to take, nothing to destroy, no concurrency to eliminate, ...

Ethereum community always growing and project start to flowering, we are happy of this and hope your work do things better for all!

Have nice work at Devcon2!

Here are the latest geth stable releases bundled up into the latest Mist release. These were made outside of the usual Mist release workflow (i.e. overwrite the bundled node with the cross built geth and pack up), so keep this in mind. A new official release from the Mist team is also incoming that will feature the new Geth along with other fixes.

"Alpereum ETH Pool back online, after global 'Geth' client issue","Today at around 20:00 CET (Paris time) Sep. 18th 2016, the 'Geth' clients on our pool started failing / producing corrupt blockchain data, forcing our pool services to a halt.

&nbsp;

It was quickly determined that this was caused by a general problem with the 'Geth' client and the network, and Alpereum was quickly switched to global use of the 'Parity' client, but a speedy relaunch was prevented by the need for the Parity clients on our servers to fully syncronize.
Several descriptions and discussions on the geth problem are available at: https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum

&nbsp;

As of 04:25 CET, Sept 19th, the Alpereum 'Parity' nodes had syncronized, and the pool relaunched on the 'Parity' client, with full functionality, except payouts, which are disabled pending thorough tests on 'Parity', but balances will be updated and kept.

&nbsp;

Payouts are expected to be functioning as well within the next 12 hours, and no funds will be lost in the meantime.

&nbsp;

For the loss of service in the 8 hours Alpereum services were unavailable, and altough strictly not an Alpereum issue, all our clients with were with us prior to the Geth issue, are subject to a refund from us for the downtime suffered. 

&nbsp;

Send us a worker link at support@alpereum.zendesk.com, along with estimated ETH loss, and we'll verify and pay the loss-of-service refund directly to the mining wallets.

&nbsp;

On Aplereum.ch we'll keep uptating on the issue, until all test unanimously point to the issue being fully resoleved. 

&nbsp;

Thank you for your patience and understanding. We will continue to monitor the situation carefully.

Where can I donate ETH to the folks who helped avert this crisis/solve the exploit?,"First of all, I'd like to say thanks to everyone who went to work on fixing this today.  I'd love to donate some ETH to the Parity developers -- without their continued support on their less-popular client, today could have been a whole lot worse.  I looked on the ethcore website but couldn't find any donation address, so /u/rphmeier - where should I send my ETH to? I'm sure other folks would love to know as well. Decentralization at its finest!

I'd also like to throw a couple ETH toward the people who identified and patched the geth bug.  I'm grateful for your help as well!

A little preday round up. Lots of people started connecting and meeting and random places around Shanghai. A LOT of it was coordinated via the WeChat groups mentioned here https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/538j98/devcon2_last_state_of_need_to_know_info_that/

Unfortunately both WeChat groups are now at capactity, so you'll need to get someone at Devcon to scan the QR code on your phone to add you as a friend, and then invite you to the group.

There was the main fork which met up at Hyatt and moved upstairs to the Hyatt's Vue bar. The drinks were a little pricey at standard ""bar prices"", but it had an outdoors jacuzzi on the rooftop! https://imgur.com/a/Yn1Nf 
There were about 18 people 

Then there was the Devcon classic fork, being run by the ""French connection"" which met up at the at a restautant in another part of Shanghai. They ended up getting very food at a stick restautant https://imgur.com/a/Hjzjq

The main purpose of preday was just everyone catching up, meeting new people. I knew no one coming into this, and met a bunch of new people. It is going to be a great conference

"Poloniex is holding roughly $25,000 worth of my ETH, withdrawal shows ""Complete"", and Txid is non-existent.","UPDATE: Resolved, Tristan from support team resubmitted transactions and this time it went through. No explanation about what happened, but I assume some wallet issue.

-------------------

Yesterday there were withdrawal issues all day at Poloniex, and then some people started saying it was all good, but I have not received my ETH, even though the withdrawal screen has the two transactions as ""Complete"". The txid they have for the withdrawals are not even found on the block explorer.

I've sent two tickets to support, it's only been some hours, but the whole thing just seems shady, especially with the non-existent txid. I felt better when my withdrawals just wouldn't go through and I could cancel them. Once people started receiving the withdrawal emails, I thought it was ok to withdraw so I did, I also received the withdrawal emails, and the withdrawals say complete, but the funds are nowhere to be found.

I also think it's a bit disingenuous to still allow deposits for coins where withdrawals aren't working, and someone in the chat said the issue was only for bigger balances, and that the transactions were caught in a ""loop"" during a server outage, and that a dev would be needed to fix a bug in ethcore or something like that. He said that was just a rumor though.

I can post the screenshots, but I need to know if it's safe to do that with my public address and txid showing, I haven't kept up with that whole replay attack thing between ETH and ETC.

Tips & lessons learned in navigating Shanghai on the way to Devcon 2,"For those last minute travellers, here are some lessons learned from our trip thus far.  

1) Flight: We got into Pudang airport without issue.  No problems with customs.  Everything went great up to that point.  This seems straightforward.

2) Navigating the airport:

Salespeople: They will accost you.  You have no reason to chat with anyone once you are past customs unless you initiate the conversation.  They understand ""no, thanks."" and a shake of your head.  Keep walking.

ATMs: You need to get some Yuan.  ATMs at the airport will offer English - choose that, and get a few hundred to a few thousand yuan, depending on how you roll.  The taxi ride to the Hyatt (or your hotel, if near the Hyatt), will cost about 30 bucks.  Never give your credit card or atm card to anyone.  Just get cash at ATMs or, ideally, the bank of china.

Getting a phone sim: You can get a China telecom phone sim at the airport.  That will allow you to at least get a phone number that people can call you on, and some data.  There is a whole list of apps and stuff that are useful.  You probably won't be grabbing them while at the airport, so I'll cover those in an addendum.  With 1G data, this sim should run you about 50US or 300 yuan.

Using Uber:  We couldn't get Uber working, even though we had a T-mobile phone.  A T-mobile phone will still work and access google services (at least ours did).  To our knowledge, nothing else will, unless you added a VPN that you know works in China before you arrived.  Theoretically, it doesn't matter that Uber is in chinese if you can find things on the map.  Uber was super flaky for us and we couldn't find our hotel on the map.  That said, if you can use Uber, it's probably much nicer than the taxi service (again - theoretically).

Using Google Maps: Most locations of businesses are incorrect on google maps.  Streets are correct, though.  If you know the street and address, and you have a T-mobile device, you should be able to show the cross streets to a taxi driver (we did) or ask the taxi dispatcher at the airport to translate for you.  You can still use google maps, but you need to add locations yourself.

Ideally, you would have the chinese name of your hotel on paper to hand a taxi driver, along with the street address and cross street.

**DO NOT USE!!, these are directions to the wrong Hyatt!**
The Hyatts Chinese name, and taxi driver instructions, are here:
--https://shanghai.grand.hyatt.com/hyatt/images/hotels/shagh/SHAGHTaxiMap.pdf--
**DO NOT USE!!, these are directions to the wrong Hyatt!**


3) Once in the taxi: He should start the meter.  If not, ask him to.  Our cab driver veered WAY off course, slowed to about 2 miles an hour, and bumped into a pedestrian.  Then he stopped, conferred with the pedestrian, and yelled at us, asking for money.  Again, we used ""NO."" in consensus, and shook our heads.  The driver gave up after about a minute, shook hands with his friend who he ""hit"", and took us to where we originally asked.  Tipping is not expected in China.

4) Once in your hotel:  Ignore knocks on the door.  Or at least don't open it unless you verify who it is verbally first.  A whole lot of hotels, even good ones, are rife with unsavory characters.  Last thing you need.  

5) Getting from your hotel to the Hyatt (if your hotel is not the Hyatt):

Use the taxi card for the Hyatt or walk if you are within 10 blocks (see 2).  Sorry, but learning how to use public transit is out of scope, and I doubt the Uber app will be more reliable for you than for us.  Grab an umbrella from your hotel before you go.

Be careful of slippery ground when you walk around Shanghai, it's treacherous.

The Hyatt is one tower in a two-tower hotel, the other tower is evidently called Shim.  I don't think ""Shim"" likes the Hyatt, because the Hyatt signs are impossible to see from the street.

6) Stuff nearby the Hyatt: Starbucks one block over with good wifi (but no bathroom), with HSBC bank and a 7-11 in the same building.  Before 7AM, you won't find much of anything open in Shanghai.  Try to get to bed at about 10:30 and up at 6:30AM.

Addenda:

A) Security:

This was covered in another thread.  I think precautions are fun, so I brought burner laptops and cell phones and burner accounts on everything (inconvenient in a way, because I don't get to have cell phone apps).  Don't be fooled into believing that you are not a juicy target for crackers - a whole lot of ether and bitcoin can be gained by bugging us.  So don't let your laptop or cell out of your sight.

IMHO, the government could get the creds of a careful developer if they really wanted to - they can bug anything - reputably, they also have solder-in hardware mod labs in every city, use human intelligence regularly and pervasively.

But none of that makes sense in the case of developers here.  The average intelligence officer probably realizes that this is a group of developers with a chance to help China advance their society.  In reality, they will be protecting you from the more real threat of criminal crackers, laying the bitch hand down on crackers trying to steal from you, and changing their lives forever.  So don't worry too much about it (unless you like that kind of thing, then be very paranoid, like me :) ).

B) Apps that are awesome for Shanghai and their equivalents in the rest of the world:
(Again, I don't get to use these - but I hear they are awesome)

* Wechat - Facebook
* Ringy - Unique - volunteer translators
* Pleco - Google Translate
* ExpressVPN - just a VPN but it works in China - use the Hong Kong pop
* Bon App - Yelp
* City Weekend - Just tourist stuff
* Smart Shanghai - FunCheap (city events)

C) Communicating overseas: 
Tell people that the cheapest way to do things is just to use skype to skype.
When people want to reach you on your cell, they can use skype to cell.  Works great.

D) Things you will want to bring or buy:
Toilet Paper - carry it with you from the hotel - lots of places don't have TP, but do have a squat toilet or sit toilet.

OpenBazaar needs better name registration. Can the Ethereum community help us?,"Over at OpenBazaar we have a DNS-like system that maps human-readable handles to machine-readable GUIDs. For example, the `@duosearch` handle maps to `ad8a93b524ad02de23ddd7760e49a34bc55f9b19`. This system is based on [Blockstack Core](https://blockstack.org/articles/how-blockstack-works) and is overlaid by [OneName](https://onename.com/). The Blockstack Core network sits on Bitcoin.

The problem is that OpenBazaar vendors are having a hard time registering handles (their store handles stay marked as ""pending""). As I understand, OneName is paying a small mining fee on behalf of its users. With the current setup handle registrations can take days to confirm and sometimes never confirm. This UX has caused frustration for OpenBazaar vendors.

OpenBazaar 2.0 (the new version of OpenBazaar, rewritten from scratch) will likely launch in about 6 months. There is an opportunity to improve the name registration for OB2.0. Can the Ethereum community help? Do you have a practical name registration that is in production today and is well-tested?

**Edit** Muneeb Ali from Blockstack is diligently working with us to address the current issues faced, and is being very helpful.

Introducing greenYvest - community owned sustainable projects,"Dear Community,

We are excited to introduce the result of our work over the last several months.

The page is currently targeted toward our potential strategic partners, in Germany and Myanmar, so it doesn't show the complete vision to avoid overwhelming them. We are starting relatively small with the onsite pilot projects first, but we also have great vision how the power of the Ethereum can be used for disrupting the normally pretty centralised renewable energy business.

Essentially, our aim at this stage is to build a platform where the community can arrange itself and build solar panel installations all over the world - obviously self-selecting for the most efficient places with sufficient sun. Every single installation should belong to the community, with ownership being ruled by the digital tokens. When the sun is shining the panels are generating energy, which is then consumed and paid for, with the system automatically directing profits to the holders of the tokens. Every installation will get its own token and all of them will be tradable on the decentralised exchanges only.

I personally believe that renewable solar energy is one of the best investment opportunities in the ""real"" world right now. Normally you have no chance of getting direct ownership of a single solar panel installation, and we want to change that.

We are ready to run a ""proof-of-concept"" phase, and are looking for investors. For this we will need around 400-500k USD maximum, and maybe even less. In the next weeks we will be running a ""seed-round"" ICO (initial coin offering). We need this money to create a test company in Singapore (token holders essentially have shares as owners of the company). On the behalf of this company we will make one or two installations.

The installations will be in Myanmar, where I will be flying directly after the DevCon2 in order to meet with potential customers/consumers of the energy. The preliminary work has been done and, as it is typical for Asia, now we need to talk in person. If anyone wants to join me on this trip, I would be happy to share this special experience. The country is beautiful and much more politically stable than normally perceived in the western news media, as demonstrated by the recent removal of the imposed US sanctions by President Obama.

If everything runs well, we as a community will have a company in Singapore and also one to two solar panel installations in Myanmar. After we have it, we will start building the bridge between Ethereum Blockchain and the real world.

As visionaries and digital disruptors we respect your readiness to move revolutionary ideas into being, and are interested to hear your questions and feedback, as we prepare to launch the ICO.

"In celebration of the upcoming Devcon 2, I'd like to share a few words about why Ethereum sucks, why you all suck, and why you should worship at my feet. Prepare to be enlightened.","I've said this so many times, but somehow you all seem to be blind to my genius.  Ethereum and all these other altcoin disasters are an absolute disgrace to the Bitcoin community.  You all are trampling on Satoshi's grave by exploring non-bitcoin solutions to the world's problems.  How you don't see that is beyond me.  

And now you're going to have your little get-together in China and discuss ideas that weren't Satoshi's or mine, and it really gets my goat.

So, since you have such a hard time understanding that your efforts are worthless and your projects are all complete shit, I'm going to lay it out for you very simply and clearly in an analogy that even a comatose jellyfish could comprehend.

Let's compare blockchain technology to the  transportation industry.  In this scenario, Satoshi Nakomoto is like Henry Ford, and Bitcoin is like Ford motorcars. 

Ford Motors was established in 1903 when Henry Ford had a vision for mass produced cars, and he made it come true.   He got it right from the start, and his Model T is the gold standard for automobiles.

However, it wasn't long before fakers and scammers came out of the woodworks, trying to improve on the perfection that Henry had crafted.  Scamcar brands proliferated, each claiming to have some new innovation that was better than Ford.  I'm not going to even mention their brand names; they do not even merit a mention.   But they claimed to make improvement in areas such as ""engine efficiency,""  ""Aerodynamics,"" and ""comfort,"" bullshit made-up problems they invented so they could sell their own cars.

And the goddamn moron general public ate it up, because the scamcar dealers were such good marketers.  But it was all marketing hype; none of the altcars ever came to be anything successful.  

But the scammers didn't stop there.  They started building ""specialty"" cars for certain situations.  Some people claimed they wanted to dig in the ground with their cars, so a company named Caterpillar  (More like Scampterpillar) built some cars they claimed could dig in the ground and help with construction.   What the fuck was the point?  Get a goddamn shovel and stick some dirt in the back of your Model T; it can carry dirt better than anything around.  Again, the scammers were solving problems that simply didn't exist, and the hyper-gullible public took it hook, line, and sinker.  If they'd only listened to me.

And, what all the scamcar fans and engineers and everyone involved don't seem to understand is, that by creating transportation projects and research that is not based on the Model T, or onHenry Ford's ideas, or my ideas, YOU ALL ARE SPITTING ON HENRY FORD'S GRAVE!!  STOP IT YOU DISRESPECTFUL BASTARDS!

So why don't you print off this analogy and read it as the opening speech of your little China party, and then when you all see the light you can just cancel the rest and go home and watch some videos of me talking about myself.  You'll be much better off in the end.

Edit:  Fixed a typo.  Not that I made a mistake, but that the goddamned English language couldn't sufficiently express my ideas, so I had to improve it.",298.0,2016-09-15 19:58:53,0.86

Anyone else concerned about China hacking devices at DevCon2?,"Originally I thought people were just being paranoid, but recently I have seen reports (potentially hearsay) of hotel ""IT staff"" and airport security hacking devices. 

Anyone else concerned, especially since we are going to an international blockchain summit, seems like an easy target. 

What measures are you taking?

Friends are buying disposable laptops, I'm taking my laptop without hdd and some encrypted bootable media. Apparently, its not too infeasible to exploit firmware (but I consider this low risk).

Let's talk about the ticket industry,"It's not news that I'm a huge fan of Ethereum and its future but I'm also cautious when it comes to which industries need disruption from a decentralized application perspective.  It's best to focus early development effort on areas where users will see large benefits from cutting out the intermediaries.  

To me, one of the most ""ripe for change"" areas when it comes to this idea is the ticket industry.  Ticketmaster owns the primary market and Stubhub owns the secondary market.  Each of them can charge exuberant fees due to having the market completely cornered.

To me, blockchain (Ethereum) technology fits perfectly into this space.  Imagine bands issuing tickets to fans (or resellers) via dapps which house unique ticket ids traceable on the blockchain.  They essentially become tokens at this point and if a user decides they want to flip these tickets at any point, the ticket is instantly verifiable and all fraud is taken out of the equation for the secondary market buyer.

The ultimate challenge here is Ticketmaster is in with the venues via contracts and these venues force bands to release their tickets on Ticketmaster.  However bands and fans lose a huge portion of profits to Ticketmaster so if a dapp can prove a low cost and better customer protection, it could create a major disruption in the industry.

I know this isn't a novel idea but haven't seen many ""new"" ideas being floating around here recently so just wanted to heard feedback.",23.0,2016-09-14 21:59:26,0.79
PSA: Survival guide to Shanghai for new arrivals.,"OK.

Google doesn't work, Google maps doesn't work, very few people speak English, very few people in stores speak English, girls who initiate convo's with you are scammers.  

So the following has been tested and works.

1. ExpressVPN, buy a months worth of this before you come. It is worth it. This allows you to access google and the other services you would normally expect to be everywhere.

2. Install WeChat, Microsoft Translator and if you want buy Waygo. 

3. Buy a China Unicom prepaid sim. It's 200Y for the SIM and 1GB of Shanghai data. For 400Y you get the sim and they will load a total of 5GB for you. Take your passport along for this part. 

4. Get cash the moment you land. Make sure the ATM you're using has an English language option, they don't all have it. 

Addendum; 
UBER works here, although it is in Chinese, so you may have to go to a bit of trouble figuring it out.

PSA: The basics of not getting scammed in Shanghai,"**TL;DR Shanghai break your heart long time. Before you buy anything at all from the locals, no matter how trustworthy and nice they look, fix the price BEFOREHAND, show them how much cash you are willing to pay and don't budge on a cent more. DO NOT EVEN TAKE YOUR CARDS ALONG**

Many Ethers were lost bringing you this information...

So I've been scammed for over a months worth of rent. Now given I live in one of the cheapest real-estate cities in the world, but for me this is a significant amount of money.

1. Tea scams. Basically someone (probably a female, probably a ""student"") tell you their on vacation in the city from YadaYada province where the grass is green and the cows give milk, etc. They invite you to join them on their walking tour, the first stop of which is a ""tea ceremony"" (actual tea and descriptions are pretty good actually). The price however is kinda high, like 300Y. If like me you just arrived you don't know how to price things this feels a bit much but you don't really have something to compare it to, and they are relying on the politeness of westerners to not make a scene. They also ""pay"" like half, which makes you think it's normal (it's not they are getting that money plus a kick back).

2. Friendly women. So two girls would approach you (and lurking unseen their muscle) and start chatting. Language barrier makes how the interaction started exactly a little confusing. So soon they offer to take you for coffee. You suggest Starbucks but they ""know"" there's a better place around the corner. You sit down and have a conversation in broken English. They seem very interested. Drinks come, pretty bland ones by western standards, and for some reason they keep coming. Eventually the bill comes and it is an unbelievable 2500Y. Now at this stage you are really confused because you've been out in strange places with 100%+ sin taxes before. You have no idea how the hell a bowl of fruit, a bowl of nuts one coffee and 9 wines escalated to a months rent. Now even given red wine is just ridiculous here, this is not the price you should be paying.

3. You stand outside a join after 1 and 2 have happened. You use your nifty app to CHECK THE PRICES before hand. For some reason they charge you 120% MORE than the advertised price on the front of the store. 

So in conclusion:
1. It's relatively safe to carry cash. Go draw cash and carry that in quantities you are willing to get lost. 
2. In anything that isn't very obviously a franchise, determine the prices BEFOREHAND and show the proprietor how much you are willing to pay before anything happens. ",44.0,2016-09-14 16:17:27,0.92
Let's build an army of Ethereum nodes!,"Hi everyone!

I ran into Ethereum several months ago while reading about bitcoin and the blockchain and was quite impressed by some videos explaining the project (most of them by Vitalik himself). During this time I've tried to educate myself on this breakthrough technology. And at this point, I'd like to get a little more involved. I think that one easy way to contribute to this fascinating project is by running a full Ethereum node, so let me share some stuff of my experience of setting up an Ethereum node on Raspberry Pi 3.

While doing some research about the best Ethereum client for my raspberry Pi 3 I realized that pretty much there are no ARM nodes on the network (according to ethernodes.org). Shouldn't be precisely the opposite? ARM devices such as Raspberry Pi have a good performance, are cheap and power-efficient.

I looked into ""EthEmbedded"" [1] (great project, by the way) but it is mainly focused on Geth and Eth clients and you need to run the Ethereum clients manually. It's built on top of Ubuntu mate (and we need to keep things light). Besides, I was looking something more Flash & Play :-).

So, I compiled Parity from source on my raspberry Pi 3 (which is the most efficient Ethereum client out there [2]) and gave it a try. I was really surprised with the overall performance and thought that it would be great to get an Ethereum node up and running easiest way possible.

So, I built a custom Raspbian image which runs Parity as a boot up service and starts syncing the blockchain with no user interaction. This is what I got so far:

A custom [3] Raspbian [4] image with Ethcore Parity 1.3 [5] integrated. The image is generated using pi-gen [6] (plus a couple of files for Parity installation)

Some remarks:

 - Parity was compiled from source according to Ethcore official documentation [7]
 - Parity binary is deployed through a debian package [8] (based on the official Ethcore Ubuntu x86 package plus some minor modifications [9])
 - MicroSD partition is resized automatically on first boot (this is a default Raspbian feature)
 - Parity runs as a Systemd service (as ""pi"" user) and it is started right after the network goes up. The Systemd option ""Restart=always"" is enabled for keeping Parity alive in case the process dies or gets killed
 - This is a Raspbian Lite Image (no Xorg environment) to save as much resources as possible.
 - Installation is pretty much flash and play. The idea is to quickly set up an Ethereum node even by non tech-savvy users.
 - Once the full blockchain is synced, Parity cpu load rarely goes beyond 40% which I think it's an outstanding performance for this kind of devices (Ethcore team did an amazing job here).
 - You can get the current Parity output by running ""sudo systemctl status parity""
 - SSH is enabled by default so you can connect remotely to the Raspberry
 
Final thoughts:

I think there are several reasons to try to increase Ethereum ARM nodes in the coming months:

- Light clients are around the corner and this may affect the total number of Ethereum full nodes.
- Share economy: Devices like Raspberry Pi's should be key components of web3 and IoT infraestructure. Conventional x86 computers are a waste of resources for this kind of tasks
- POS: There's no much information regarding PoS but it would be great to use this kind of devices for the stake process (don't know if this is possible at all)

Public contract code review. CHAINY — aeon short links and Proof Of Existing.,"Hi everybody!	

Everex team is almost finished moving https://Chainy.link project from Bitcoin blockchain to Ethereum DAPP and would like to collect your feedback about the contract code. 

In short words, **Chainy is the independent DAPP** with (optional) online interface which 

a) creates authentic irreplaceable short URLs  

b) permanent proof of existence of the document (file) together with link to the file

c) public text message on the [Ethereum] blockchain. 

Essentially, Chainy is a simple independent smart contract, which exists for as long as blockchain lives, and it's independent from anybody. Even if we abandon this project, and it will be impossible to look up the data using other viewers or blockchain explorers or scanners, all previously stored proofs and data will be available via the Ethereum API, for example through Mist. Just as we all like it :))

To create new proof entry, the user must request  a call contract method addChainyData with JSON string.
It will return unique short code index entry, encoded from a block number and a few characters of the sender address (in case if few records will fall into the same block at the same time).

To get your entry using short code, user must call method getChainyData with the code. The data format is simple to understand, so in general even with Mist wallet, it is enough to store and see the data.

**Data types:**

1.	**AEON permanent links.** Similar to **bit.ly**, but impossible to replace or switch the destination of the url, unlike conventional URL shorteners. If a moderator has checked that the link leads to e.g. Ethereum.org, he can be absolutely sure that tomorrow and in any other day it won’t lead to a phishing site or to other malicious content nest.

2.	**File signatures** follow already well-known method, where sha256 of the file is stored in the blockchain.

3.	**File signatures along with a link to a file** is a combination of 1 and 2. This allows you to refer to the proof of existence with a link only that will show page with proof and link to the (external) file, which the user can download and check its identity with the signature.

4.	**The signed text.** Just a text message stored in blockchain. ""Bob borrowed 100 bitcoins from me”

5.	**File with signatures and file content** in blockchain. (May be later, after SWARM is released).

Each entry, besides the data itself, also contains stored timestamp and the address of the creator of the entry. Timestamp can also be calculated by the block, but we left it like that for additional convenience

Note that if you need to retain the sender’s address as yours, you must create transaction yourself (through Mist) or it may show different address, like the one provided by online service. 
However, for convenience, we also did an online form that creates JSON in the right format. You will only have to send it to a contract from your address.

Using only Mist without external services is not easy for users. Chainy provides user friendly web interface, which will take and organize the data submitted from the user and broadcast it into the contract. 

Storage format is open source, so anybody can develop a viewer. Even if the viewer is not available, a contract will always be live and you can always get proof of existence of your data by simply referring to the contract through Mist or Ethereum API. Or through the Chainy viewer, which is an open source. 


So, anybody have interest are welcome to review the Chainy contract link and send us your comments.

Swiss Finance Industry Consortium to bring OTC Equities onto Ethereum Blockchain,"OTC Equities are traded “over-the-counter”, i.e., not via a Market Exchange.
As a consequence, trade reconciliation can require substantial effort. Trade clearing and –settlement is typically slow, costly, and can involve substantial risks for the involved parties.

Blockchain Technology holds the promise to provide a remedy here by allowing instantaneous clearing and settlement, and by removing the need for error-prone reconciliation.

However, a couple of challenges need to be overcome if such a blockchain-based system should see wide adoption: 

* First of all, client data (data about the “economic beneficiary” of a transaction) needs to be kept safe during the transaction. At the same time, the system must be able to selectively reveal client information to regulatory authorities in cases of justified suspicion of criminal activities. 

* Second, the trade data itself (which is fully visible on the blockchain by default) needs to be obfuscated to the point where competitors cannot gain undue advantage by data-snooping. 

* Third, adequate governance rules for the consortium need to be formulated via Smart Contracts. As there is no central authority orchestrating the governance, this means the creation of a “Decentralized Autonomous Organization” (DAO) to take up this role.

A couple of initiatives are on the way to unlock the potential of the Blockchain for financial institutions, most prominently maybe **“R3”**. Instead of waiting for the outcome of these initiatives, a couple of high profile Swiss companies decided to move forward. They created a consortium for a research project under the lead of **IFZ/ Lucerne University of Applied Sciences and Arts**. The project is supported by the Commission for Technology and Innovation in Switzerland. Target of the project is to create a Blockchain-based system prototype that will be able to showcase real-life OTC equity clearing, settlement and reporting. If the prototype is successful, it is planned to roll out the system to other asset classes like OTC Derivatives or OTC Structured Products, and to enable trade execution directly on the blockchain. The resulting system will be open for all financial institutions who want to join.

The consortium is well set up for both impact and speed: Forward-thinking heavy-weights participate with **Swisscom** (Switzerland’s largest Telco Company), **SIX** (the Swiss Market Exchange operator), and **Zürcher Kantonalbank** (Switzerland’s 3rd largest bank), but also do the young and innovative companies **ti&m**, **Inventx** and **Incore Bank**. Hence, the consortium combines market experience, developer know-how and an excellent IT-infrastructure.

An important aspect of the project is of course the Blockchain technology that is used. “After a thorough assessment of the Blockchain platforms available today, we decided to go with **Ethereum**, and more specifically, with **Ethcore’s Parity client**” says project coordinator Dr. Mathias Bucher. “The functionality of Ethereum, and its developer eco-system creates a very robust base for what we are going to do. Parity’s efficiency and private chain capabilities are ideal for usage in a consortium context.” Ethcore’s developer team will also advise the consortium on the protocol level.

Until the end of the year, the consortium wants to have a first version of the system ready for testing and user feedback.

Etherplay beta is out!,"Hello ladies and gentlemen,

we are proud to announce the start of our beta test for http://etherplay.io, a skill game portal running on the ethereum ecosystem. 

The beta test is available at http://test.etherplay.io/catchme

Your goal is to get the highscore in our simple little game made for the occasion. Each attempt costs you some ether that go into the jackpot and for each successful attempt you have to pay some gas to get your score saved. At the end of the competition, winners get rewarded. We take a fee but to make the competition interesting for the first players, we put some of our ether in the jackpot at the beginning. 

The beta test runs on the testnet so for now there is nothing to lose or to win but we would greatly appreciate your participation. We will likely announce a reward at some point to incentivize our beta test but for now, enjoy the game and take the opportunity to sharpen your skills.

We start with a competition that will end in around 24 hour when the 3 best highscores will be rewarded automatically. Our fee will be 25%. When we will be on the mainnet, this will fund our development of new games and general development.


We have been busy making sure all works but we expect issues to come up. Let us know when you came across any. But more importantly tell us about your experience with the beta test! We are really excited to launch Etherplay and would love to get as much feedback as possible to make things even better.


If you want to get updates on Etherplay, give us your email via our website at http://etherplay.io.

We really hope you will enjoy the beta and will want to stay with us for the proper release on the mainnet.

All the best!

ETH poll: Should the Ethereum Foundation Protect its trademarks?,"Please vote with your ETH on Stake Voice here: [https://ethereum.github.io/stake-voice/?proposal=Ethereum%20Foundation%20should%20enforce%20its%20trademarks](https://ethereum.github.io/stake-voice/?proposal=Ethereum%20Foundation%20should%20enforce%20its%20trademarks) (open this URL in Mist). Voting is non-binding and costs nothing (except a tiny amount of gas).

There have been numerous posts on Reddit asking the Ethereum Foundation to protect/enforce its trademarks (""Ethereum"" name and logo), which are being used in a deceptive manner by the ""Ethereum Classic"" project. AFAIK there has been no response yet from a Foundation representative. The purpose of this poll is not to force their hand in any direction, but to provide an indication of the general sentiment among the ETH community.

**Arguments for and against the enforcing of Ethereum trademarks:**

*For:*

* The ""Ethereum"" name and logo are not some vague abstractions which belong to nobody. They are registered trademarks (at least in the EU and USA) and belong to the Ethereum Foundation.
* The Ethereum Classic project is being intentionally deceptive, e.g. naming its GitHub repository [""ethereumproject""](https://github.com/ethereumproject), illegally removing copyright notices ([link](https://github.com/ethereumproject/mist/commit/78e419dae6239203fc5030bf47ff6d47baeb219d)), vandalizing the Ethereum Wikipedia article to present themselves as the prominent Ethereum chain, and so on.
* There have been reported cases of confusion among users (buying ETC thinking that they are investing in Ethereum).
* In major jurisdictions trademarks must be actively protected, or they will be lost.

*Against:*

* The Foundation might be seen as a bully by some, or at least we can expect a negative media campaign trying to promote that view.
* Time and resources allocated by the Foundation on this matter might be better spent on platform development instead.

Note 1: I'm open to adding more arguments in the for/against sections. I'll add them in the post, if there are good suggestions in the comments.

Note 2: I'm not affiliated with the Ethereum Foundation in any way. I just think this is an important question and the community should let their opinion be known in a democratic and transparent way.",112.0,2016-09-06 14:54:35,0.78
How Hacker Could Cashout ETC,"Was just wondering, if the hacker wrote a script as follows:
    
    let x = amount to cash out per iteration
    let consolidated = new collection of XMR || SDC addresses (empty at this point)
    foreach (i in  (loot / x)) {
        let c = newly generated ETC address
        let y = newly generated XMR or SDC address
        add y into consolidated
        await send x ETC from loot-address to c
        await send x ETC from c into ShapeShift.io, convert to (XMR || SDC) into address y
    }

Having effectively converted the ETC to XMR || SDC || (XMR && SDC), could he then utilise the ring-signature features of XMR/SDC to further anonymise and consolidate 'consolidated' set of funds? Would he still be trackable if he did such a thing?

Assuming XMR/SDC could sufficiently obfuscate the hackers destination wallet, the only identity leak would be the IP address at ShapeShift.io. This could be easily overcome, though. 

Is this right?

The latest on the childDAO and extraBalance refunds,"**Disclaimer**: Information below is the current plan, to the best of my knowledge, but this plan can change, and there might be changes or delays.

**PRE-ATTACK childDAOs**: Only 4 non-refunded childDAOs left: 20, 31, 37, 57. The total amount to be refunded is 87 ETH. If you have tokens in any of these childDAO, please send me a private message quoting the number


**POST-ATTACK childDAOs without reentrancies**: 35, 36, 53, 62, 67, 68, 70, 71, 73, 76, 87. The refund is currently planned for tomorrow. The refund contract is here: http://etherscan.io/address/0x3da71558a40f63b960196cc0679847ff50fad22b
In order to use it, you need call 'withdraw' function, passing the address of your childDAO as argument. You can look up the address of your childDAO in the source code. The new feature of etherscan, on the tab 'Read contract', allows you to quickly lookup how much you would get back. The total amount to be sent to this contract is around 21'395 ETH


**POST-ATTACK childDAOs with reentrancies**: 69, 74, 78. There are only 5 addresses that qualify for the refund, those are the addresses that did not use reentrancy in their split. The owners of the 2 of them have already cryptographically confirmed that they are OK for the refund to be sent directly to these addresses (they are confident that these addresses are not vulnerable to any possible replays). The remaining 3 addresses are:

    0x5b5d8c8eed6c85ac215661de026676823faa0a0c
    0xab9acc3c451e43e18dd61ab11048c07b74c99eee
    0xe1e278e5e6bbe00b2a41d49b60853bf6791ab614

If you control any of these 3 accounts, send me a private message and I will ask you for a confirmation.
Currently there is no set date for these refunds, but they will be initiated very soon after the previous round of refunds, so soon after 6th of September.

**extraBalance**: The solution consists of two contracts. First one, tokenises the extraBalance contributions that were originally sent during the purchase of DAO tokens: http://etherscan.io/address/0x5c40ef6f527f4fba68368774e6130ce6515123f2
You can inspect the source code, and also use etherscan's new feature, on 'Read Contract' tab, to quickly check how much any account would be able to withdraw.

This contract has been constructed partly from token standard code taken from here: https://www.ethereum.org/token, and the DAO snapshot used for Whitehat ETC withdraw here: https://github.com/BitySA/whetcwithdraw/blob/master/daobalance/dao_balance_snapshot.sol. The numbers that were used to fill the token balances are taken from here: https://github.com/bokkypoobah/TheDAOData/blob/master/getTheDAOCreatedTokenEventsWithNonZeroExtraBalance_v4

The actual numbers in the contract can be (and have been) reconciled using this script: https://github.com/bokkypoobah/TheDAOData/tree/master/ExtraBalTokenValuesReconciliation

I also extensively used the prior work of other people, for example:

https://medium.com/@weka/how-to-send-ether-to-11-440-people-187e332566b7#.e6m6egxxo

https://github.com/lyricalpolymath/Ethereum_DaoExtraBalanceOwners

https://github.com/Arachnid/extrabalance


Now, the actual refund contract is almost identical to the theDAO refund contract and can be found here: http://etherscan.io/address/0x6f576af2dba6bf6308caf8feec3fc3d07501c018
There is no set date for this refund yet, but I would like this to happen some time this week.

**Note on choice of approach for distributing extraBalance**
The main reason why the token-based approach was chosen for the extraBalance, as opposed to the direct sending of ETH, is the possibly of replays. Token-based approach gives everyone the ability to protect themselves from the replay, if they choose to, by moving their tokens to a fresh address and refund from there. Scenarios where such protection might be useful are like this: you used an address to purchase DAO and contributed some to extraBalance. Then, you held DAO tokens until the fork. That made you eligible for ETC refund from Whitehat group. You received ETC, and sent it away. Transaction of sending ETC away got replayed to ETH, but was not valid yet, because your ETH balance was too low. Now you receive ETH from extraBalance refund, and previously invalid replayed transaction becomes valid, sending your ETH away, which is most probably not what you want. **So please consider whether you need such protection and plan ahead before using the extraBalance withdraw**.",34.0,2016-09-05 20:42:40,0.92
My open letter to curators of the DAO extraBalance Wallet contract - I wrote a script that could've been used to refund everyone 5 days ago... but it has been ignored without any technical discussion.,"I've sent the open letter below. I hope it prompts at least a discussion on which approach is better to be processing thousands of transactions as well as improves the community involvement.

**The body of the letter starts here:**
I'm not sure if this is the best method of contact. Hopefully it is. I would this message to make its way to the curators of the DAO extra balance refund contract if possible.

The reason I'm writing to you is that I believe there has been quite a delay with the refunding of those funds. I understand that probably it was considered the least challenging technically so the least volunteer resources were put in it.

However, there is no real reason given why would the refund not be run when I wrote the refund script and I posted a link to it last Wednesday (https://bitbucket.org/LukOlszewski/dao-extra-balance-refund/overview) 

My refund script could've been run already and people could've been refunded. Unfortunately as it doesn't fit into the ""use Solidity contracts for absolutely everything"" view it has been ignored by people in the #extrabal_community. It is not so much of a community as there is not a discussion happening on which option is technically better, more secure , easier to review etc. If there was surely a script that doesn't any movement of funds out of the current Wallet contract would be considered a better approach than writing a single contract in Solidity which is supposed to fetch data from another contract storing addresses and values to be refunded, then sending money from the wallet contract to the above mentioned new contract and hope for the best that it will process all 22k transactions in one go.

To this I contrast my approach which is to run a script written in Python that uses geth directly over a so called pipe which means it requires no special libraries so it can be run easily on windows, Linux or MacOS (whichever system the Curators have is supported).

Unfortunately all I heard in response to my submission is that someone else is working on another approach, but no successful demo has been provided, nor a deadline given.

Therefore I ask you have a look at my script on bitbucket and let me know if you plan to look at it, perhaps ask someone to review the code, or are we going to wait without a deadline in sight for ""something better""?

**edit:** We've had a conversation. It has been decided a withdrawal contract similar to the one used for the main DAO funds will be used. Such contract is a better approach than sending everyone the money as it does protect users from the possibility of replay attacks if they choose to send the funds to a different address that hasn't existed before the hard fork, or to a smart contract that can protect them from it.

**So I think this is resolved, thank you for responses and for working on this.**

the 4th industrial revolution has a backbone,"All industrial revolutions have been marked by changes in our way of communication, logistics, and energy; the third industrial revolution was marked by the arrival of computers and the internet as the way of communication, the internal combustion engine for logistics, and oil as our energy source. Today we are moving away from oil and into distributed renewable energy, away from manual logistics and into automated vehicles including drones, and the internet is being decentralized for better and more secure communications.

Like never before, this three elements are converging into what some call the Internet of Things (IoT), by 2020 (that's in less than 4 years!) we'll have a $4 trillion market composed of 25+ billion embedded systems, 25+ million apps (including dapps), and more, much more like big data and deep learning analytics... All of this would use a platform to work in an smart way (intelligent, connected, and instrumented), as with the internet there are a lot of private and consortium networks and even different protocols, but only one public backbone we all use, so in this case I argue that ethereum is and will keep being the backbone for the fourth industrial revolution, specially lately with the news of central banks creating their digital currencies which brings further stability to smart contracts. This has tremendous implications, industrial revolutions have changed society and even governments so it shouldn't be a surprise that this happens again.

Some clear examples are: transactivegrid.net for energy, drone-employee.com for logistics, and obviously consensys.net for communications. Even if you benchmark ethereum with cisco, IBM and HP, you'll find that what's being presented in devcon2 is way ahead of the curve, part of the reason for ethereum's success...",63.0,2016-09-04 02:35:43,0.9

As the various coins used on the site are mixed bitcoins, moneros and zcash Bob is vulnerable to currency effects. The highly variable valuations of these currencies can eat his profit, make him sell at a loss or prize him out of the market, all of which are bad for his business.

He needs stability so while the site accepts nearly-untraceable coins only, Bob lists his prices in the stablecoin Dai. Five kilos of Bob's bacon sells for the equivalent of 10 Dai, payable in either  
Monero or Zcash. Do note we are assuming the website to have a working realtime conversion calculator for this purpose. Bob immediately convert any sales into Dai stablecoin, ensuring profit.  
A decent darknet site could however easily have an automated function for this.

This enables Bob to have a stable and positive revenue stream independent of the fluctuations in the valuation of Bitcoins, Monero or Zcash. These currencies inherently fluctuate as hackers and law enforcement try to get their hands on them and competing currencies launch or go into terminal decline.

This is an example of where the availability of a stablecoin in itself does not drive commerce, but by its presence functions as a stability provider to lower the uncertainty of otherwise risky transactions.

This is the second article in a series on use cases for the Dai stablecoin. The first article dealt with Dai and prediction markets:

Whitehat Withdraw contract is deployed at 0x9f5304da62a5408416ea58a17a92611019bd5ce3,"The Whitehat Withdraw contract has been deployed at 0x9f5304da62a5408416ea58a17a92611019bd5ce3 . 4,171,615 ETC have been transferred and are now available to be retrieved by any DAO Token Holder who had Tokens at the Hard Fork.

Reminder, to retrieve your share of ETC please use the following options:

* https://blog.bity.com/2016/08/29/how-to-use-sign-for-the-whitehat-withdrawal/
* http://www.myetherwallet.com/#the-dao
* Directly call the `withdraw()` function of the contract in the ETC chain from your DTH at the time of the hard fork with the following argument:

- **beneficiary**: An ETC address you control where the funds will be sent to. This can also be an exchange deposit address.
- **percentageWH** A number ranging from 0 to 100, stating the percentage of your funds you would like to give as donation to the whitehat group

A great Q&A is available here: http://ethereum.stackexchange.com/questions/8338/how-do-i-convert-my-the-dao-tokens-into-ethers-on-the-ethereum-classic-chain

We also updated the last blog post: https://blog.bity.com/2016/08/29/whitehat-withdrawal-contract-last-update-before-deployment/

The method to deposit funds in the contract is only by using the `deposit()` function: `whwithdraw.deposit({from: account, gas: 90000, value: web3.toWei(ETHERAMOUNT, 'ether')})` 



Within moments of deploying the initial contract, we discovered an irregular behaviour when people were donating 0% We decided to immediately stop the contract using the Escape Hatch while we looked into the irregularities. 

After investigation, it appears that using the `send()` function with a value of 0 from a contract account to a multisig account will not work. The reason is that send() with a value of 0 gives a gas stipend of 0 gas which when sending to the typical multisig wallet hits this line (https://github.com/ethereum/dapp-bin/blob/master/wallet/wallet.sol#L336) and has no gas to spend. As a result, the whole transaction was throwing. This issue was fixed by not calling the send() function if a zero donation is detected. We of course had tests available (https://github.com/BitySA/whetcwithdraw/blob/086170f38eef1762726c4109a3ed713d79b87c26/tests/deploy.js#L274) for this scenario, but with a normal end-user account as the donation address instead of a multi-sig wallet. This is why the discrepancy was not discovered until we went live.

We were able to reproduce, adjust, test, and deploy a modified contract at 0x9f5304da62a5408416ea58a17a92611019bd5ce3. In this new contract, we pre-populated the `paidOut` mapping for the people who had already performed withdrawals. 54 transactions already had happened. 

If you are part of these 54 transactions and you were forced to use 1% as a donation argument to make the transaction go through, please contact us and we will send the remaining back to you.

-----
Some best practises:

- use at least 200,000 of gas.
- use only lowercase addresses (https://convertcase.net/)

"EtherDelta has a new smart contract, please withdraw from the old one","TLDR: [EtherDelta](https://etherdelta.github.io) has a new smart contract. Please withdraw from the old one. Non-critical bug fix.

Details on the upgrade: the old version of the smart contract had a bug that would let anyone cancel your resting orders. It wasn't possible to do this through the GUI. This bug does not affect your trades, deposits, or withdrawals. It's fairly benign, but is clearly incorrect and could easily become a nuisance. If you withdraw from the old contract, your orders will automatically disappear there and reappear on the new contract when you deposit. Thanks and apologies!

* Low level use by Dapps and not users
* Low bandwidth small transfers
* Low latency transfers only

But why? Wouldn't it be better in the long run to design a general network solution to ""decentralize the web"" like Tor and IPFS? After all, that's pretty much what our network infrastructure needs: an anonymous and secure replacement for HTTP, like ""transactions without the eventual archival"".",22.0,2016-08-30 05:58:57,0.93

Casper betting,"I'm preparing a presentation on casper for a meetup, and couldn't find the answers to some questions I had. Perhaps someone here can knows, or can point me in the right direction.


What incentive is there for validators to bet on a block early, rather than just waiting for the rest of the validators to reach consensus first? AFAICT, the [reward/penalty](https://github.com/ethereum/economic-modeling/tree/master/casper) is independent of when the bet was made. Wouldn't a validator get an optimal reward by betting after a block is finalized (or just before it's finalized, if that's disallowed).


Is there a penalty for changing a bet to have a lower probability or different block? Otherwise, I don't see how the penalty could ever apply, since validators would just change to a favorable bet later.

Since bets are made [through a contract](https://blog.ethereum.org/2015/12/28/understanding-serenity-part-2-casper/) they must be included in blocks. Validators are also responsible for creating blocks. Is there ever an incentive for a validator to exclude a bet from a block, or does it not matter as long as the bet eventually makes it into a block? Is there an incentive for a validator to include a bet in a block? Do bets include transaction fees?

Time Countdown: DAO classic refund,"Part of the DAO’s ethers were drained in what some might call an attack or hack on 17 June 2016. As not all ethers were drained, a group that calls themselves the White Hat Group (WHG) then drained the remaining more than 7 million ethers. WHG had recently managed to move the ethers out of the DAO on the classic chain and decided to refund DAO token holders..

Similar to the refund on the ETH chain, the DAO classic refund is done through a smart contract. Through the transparency of the blockchain, we are able to track the usage of this contract. 

You can follow us on https://daoc.codetract.io/ to countdown when you will be able to execute the withdrawal contract.

"Thinking of turning my 10 year old company into a DAO, need advice","Hello! I'm the founder of [Haschek Solutions](https://haschek.solutions) and I joined the Ethereum community a few weeks ago.

I'm very intrigued by smart contracts and I want to use it in the real world on my real company.

## About my Company
[Haschek Solutions](https://haschek.solutions) a reputable 10 year old company which is mainly working in the fields of Education and security. We have created an [XP based grading system](http://enterprise-gamification.com/mediawiki/index.php?title=XP-based_grading_system) called [Socialcube](https://www.socialcube.net) which got overwhelmingly positive feedback in [international media](https://blog.tophat.com/gamifying-education/) and harbors now over 400 schools and universities from 14 countries.

Also we do security research and even got featured in [Wired](http://www.wired.com/2015/07/proxy-services-totally-unsecure-alternatives/) and by Brian Krebs for analysis of proxy servers (featuring our [Proxychecker](https://proxycheck.haschek.at/)).

Also we manage school networks for public schools in Austria. We have a government contract for that.

## My plans for a DAO
I would like to create a contract which manages my company shares via Ethereum. Once a month there will be a **poll on company decisions** and every investor can vote according to their shares.

Investors will get insights on our projects and can create polls on their own which (after passing a minimum investor activity) will be discussed by the company board (My partners and me)

I also want to do profit distribution in the form of a **dividend** to all investors.

And since I don't want this to be an uncertain thing I want to add the whole DAO decision making process and dividend an **official company statute**.

**what do you think?**

Is there a flaw in my thought process or are you as excited as me?

I'd love to hear your feedback!

Whatever happened to Dr. Y and his Ethereum Contract Analyzer?,"I found his analyzer pretty useful and great for checking simpler contracts. Unfortunately, it seems to have disappeared with him after the whole DAO fiasco, and sadly, it wasn't open-source.

Anyone have anything similar, or if he can even chime in that'd be great! Really, the one thing that made me want to vote for one of the slock.it proposals, was to have /u/dr-y hired by the DAO. Hopefully he's still around and we get something similar.

"BitBastion is working with the Honduras government to create a new autonomous city through the ZEDE program. This allows our city to have a high level of autonomy with its own political system, and is in theory based on free market capitalism with our city integrating blockchain applications.","[Article about us](http://themerkle.com/bit-bastion-wants-to-create-a-physical-dao-city/)

A lot of you may remember the threads I made in the past about BitBastion, well we are ramping up and we really want to see this dream become a reality.

For the initial phase of our independent nation we will be utilizing the ZEDE (Zone for Employment and Economic Development) program. The ZEDE program allows for a city to be created and provides a high level of autonomy with its own political system, at a judicial, economic and administrative level, and is in theory based on free market capitalism.

ZEDE has the following objectives for economic development

1.International logistics centres that permit the processing of goods at a grand scale. Like the Colón Free Trade Zone in Panamá.

2.International business courts that resolve disputes between both national and foreign business entities. Like the Isle of Man, United Kingdom.

3.Special investment districts that permit the creation of centres for the service sector. Like the Cayman Enterprise City, Cayman Islands.

4.Districts for renewable energy that permit investment in renewable energy. Like the solar parks in Arizona, United States.

5.Special economic zones in which the laws that govern the economy will be different from the rest of the country. National laws might be suspended in favor of solutions based on a free market. Compare Shenzhen, China.

6.Zones subject to a special judicial system that function under a judicial tradition different from the usual. Like the courts in the financial districts of Dubai that are subject to Common Law.

7.Special agro-industrial zones that permit incentives for exporting high-quality agricultural products. Like the cultivation of asparagus in Peru.

8.Special tourist zones that permit special conditions for creating centres for tourism in undeveloped parts of the country.

We will utilize this program to create an autonomous state that can be the worldwide hub of blockchain technology.

"Mist coinbase integration is ethically legit, organic, and intelligent. Market-Driven Evolution Fallaciously Branded As 'Favoritism'","The debates swirling around Ethereum over the last many weeks have been fairly rampant with scare-words, the most recent of which is 'favoritism' in the case of Coinbase integration in the latest Mist 0.8.2 release. (See: https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/4zf1jf/wallet_and_mist_082_coinbase_integration_replay/ ) 

Previous common scare-words/phrases have been things like 'slippery slope', 'dangerous precedent', 'bailout', all conceptually misapplied in a general negative-emotional bucket-wash by opponents of the remedial hardfork.

The core fallacy in such usages is known in cognitive bias theory as 'Attribute Substitution': ""[This] occurs when an individual has to make a judgment (of a target attribute) that is computationally complex, and instead substitutes a more easily calculated heuristic attribute. This substitution is thought of as taking place in the automatic intuitive judgment system, rather than the more self-aware reflective system. Hence, when someone tries to answer a difficult question, they may actually answer a related but different question, without realizing that a substitution has taken place. This explains why individuals can be unaware of their own biases, and why biases persist even when the subject is made aware of them."" (Wikipedia).

Now we have allegations of 'favoritism', painting the Coinbase integration in Mist as unethical 'preferential treatment' given by the Ethereum Foundation and Mist team to a 3rd party corporate interest. The implication is one of monopolistic, financially motivated collusion of parties, betraying the Foundation's 'obligation of neutrality' and sullying its philosophical purity yet again. I say, ""Hogwash"". It is nothing of the kind.

If Ethereum is to have any hope of mainstream adoption, it must work smartly with the resources at hand, in the ecosystem such as it is - in reality, not in a hypothetical dream-world. Coinbase is arguably best-in-class at the moment at what it does. Its integration of ETH on GDAX (and subsequently its retail user platform) was monumental for Ethereum. This is called market-driven evolution, witnessed in real-time. A reciprocal (albeit relatively trivial) move on the part of the Mist team to enhance the wallet with Coinbase functionality is likewise just that: market-driven evolution. 

At any given point in time, it cannot - and need not - be avoided that certain parties will benefit more than others. This is what happens when pragmatic, merit-based decisions are made. 

For comparison, let us take the decision of the Jaxx team to add DASHpay support on their platform. Granted, DASH is not a corporate interest/provider. And yet, if you were holding DASH - or had advance notice of the coming release-date - you'd have profited handsomely from the stunning anticipatory rally DASH experienced over the first two weeks of 8/2016, immediately prior to that release. Did I whine about 'favoritism' and the inevitable front-running opportunity some enjoyed and not others? Certainly not.

In sum, I applaud /u/avsa, the Foundation, and the entire Ethereum developer ecosystem, for their continued efforts with Mist and for consistently meeting Ethereum's many needs and challenges head-on as they arise.

The Ethereum wikipedia is a mess,"Basically, the [Ethereum wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethereum) is poorly written, and is mostly a bunch of semi-random statements related to various events. It does a very poor job explaining what Ethereum is or how it works.

The primary reason for this is that everything on Wikipedia needs to be sourced from a ""verifiable third-party"". So most of what is on there is references to press articles.

Ethereum Foundation sources obvious are not ""third party"" in this instance so while they contain a lot of great information, they cannot be used in the article. Can we get some good recommendations for third party sources to use to improve the quality of the article? I think it would be helpful to focus more on the academic/technical side of things first, which is severely lacking.

Dindle Proof of concept,"Hi guys,
I have been doing research on blockchain and building a POC of Dindle. Its a decentralized ebook marketplace (Decentralized + Kindle = Dindle :)) Its been deployed on testnet for feedback purpose.

It allows a platform for authors to publish their books. Optionally, they can give an ethereum address (publisher) with whom they want to share 20% profit. The books and book covers will be hosted securely on ipfs. 

Users can purchase the books and read it inside the app itself. If they want, they can list it for resale for 80% of the price (for now). If someone buys it the user gets 50% of the sale, author gets 30% and publisher gets 20%.  Everyone gets a cut of the sale instantly.

Please give it a try and let me know your thoughts. Please open it on a smartphone ONLY (or smartphone mode in chrome developer tools). No mist browser or metamask required as it is currently using hosted ethereum node and accounts.

Help us translate MyEtherWallet.com into ALL THE LANGUAGES!,"tl;dr: Translation files for German, English, Spanish, Italian, Vietnamese, Slovenian, French, Korean, and Norwegian are ready here: https://github.com/kvhnuke/etherwallet/tree/mercury/app/scripts/translations - comment if you speak another language and I'll set it up ASAP.

---

I mentioned a couple weeks back that we were prepping to set MyEtherWallet to be available in all the languages. I've done so, but now we need the community's help to get the actual translation part done. I have done my best below to write out clear instructions on how to help out (even if you are not a developer), but I actually have no idea what I am doing and I have never done this before. Please let me know if something isn't clear or you need more assistance.




## How to Help Translate

**A couple of notes:**

- It uses [markdown](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet) (like reddit comments).

- Everything on the entire site is broken down into lines and in this one file. It's kinda crazy. The uppermost items are the highest priority and the further you go down, the less of a priority it is.

- You can add comments anywhere like so: `/* Your_Comment_Here */`. If you want to leave a note for yourself or someone else, do so in this format. That way it doesn't screw up the code or show up somewhere on the site. 

- Don't delete any lines. Just leave it in English if you don't know how to translate it. 

- Always make sure each line ends with `',`. So the format is `NAME: ' your text here ',` You only need to change the `your text here` part - try not to touch anything else. 

---

**If you are NOT a developer and have no idea how this works:** 

Anyone can help out and it looks way more complicated than it is! If you would rather not deal with Github, please just email us a myetherwallet at gmail dot com and I'll email you the file and you can make changes and send it back to us and I'll make sure you don't screw anything up. If you feel like experiencing something new, read on!

1. Sign into your Github account or make a new Github account.
2. Go to https://github.com/kvhnuke/etherwallet/tree/mercury/app/scripts/translations
3. Click on the language file you want to update.
4. Look in the upper right. You will see ""Raw"" ""Blame"" and so on. Click the pencil icon. This will then tell you, *""You’re editing a file in a project you don’t have write access to. We’ve created a fork of this project for you to commit your proposed changes to. Submitting a change to this file will write it to a new branch in your fork, so you can send a pull request.""* Ignore all this gibberish. [Screenshot](https://ipfs.pics/ipfs/QmejqvFu71QhQ5zfYMQyUYazWwnSpVHtQnE12pT2T9QEX5).
5. In your browser, start translating. Translate as little or as much as you want. [Screenshot](https://ipfs.pics/ipfs/QmUQd2w2ah1Bnfocuu7egamp44EqtcNCTx3TziWcmwfTme).
6. Scroll down to ~line 240 and enter your name/username, donation address, and any comments you would like to leave. [Screenshot](https://ipfs.pics/ipfs/QmdnhpdMZHRk1DyrFNyN7Rgm5G58NrkMJAvJNGg35oQ2UC).
7. When you are done, tell us what language you updated. You can also leave any notes about problems you had or things you'd like us to know.
8. Click the green ""Propose File change"" button. [Screenshot](https://ipfs.pics/ipfs/QmQoLPs6JkSfZsMvGCBCvudyJiWNFqcSHNMzAncjyrw1Sx)
9. This next page is a review of what you did.
10. Click the ""Create Pull Request"" button.....twice. [Screenshot](https://ipfs.pics/ipfs/QmZJJvPxXu7BFHDQ1zj1a73EATQETbsDuAJVEJnatTHrms).
11. That's it. You successfully made a new pull request! Tell all your friends.
12. We will now review it and pull it in and it will be made live on the site. We may also ask you questions if something is confusing for whatever reason.

**If you don't want to edit it in your browser for whatever reason:**

That is fine but there are a couple of things you need to know. First is you NEED to use a text editor that is made for this. Not Word. I personally use Sublime Text 3 because it is pretty. You can download it for free here: https://www.sublimetext.com/3

You can also use TextEdit on a Mac or Notepad on a PC. However, you need to make sure it is **plain text!!!** before you start editing. Using TextEdit, open a new document and then go to Format -> Make Plain Text. Then you can copy and paste everything from the Github page into Text edit. If you want to save it to work on later, save it with a .js extension. Don't try to bold things or highlight them. That will turn it back into rich text and add a bunch of other data that no one needs. When you are done, paste it back into Github page and submit a Pull Request as I described above.

On a PC, I have no idea. I think notepad is plain text by default so you should be okay. *crosses fingers*

---

**If you are a developer and familiar with GitHub, Pull Requests, and know how to save a JS file as a .js file rather than a Word Doc:**

1. Clone the [mercury branch](https://github.com/kvhnuke/etherwallet/tree/mercury).
2. Go to `/app/scripts/translations/`.
3. Open the language you want to translate.
4. Translate as much or as little as you wish.
5. Add your name/username, donation address, and any notes you would like on ~line 240 of the language.js file.
6. Open a PR and leave us a brief description of what you did and any issues you ran into or comments you have.

---

**If your language isn't there yet:**

We've set up German, English, Spanish, Italian, Vietnamese, Slovenian, French, Korean, and Norwegian. We can add any number of languages, very quickly. Leave a comment or email us at myetherwallet at gmail dot com and I will add it ASAP so you can update it.

**If you are a developer and want to add a new language:**

1. Copy and paste the ""en.js"" and rename it to your language. [You can find your language code here](http://www.w3schools.com/tags/ref_language_codes.asp)
2. Open the file. On line 3 - line 5 change all en's to your language code: var **en** = function() {} **en**.code = '**en**'; **en**.data = {

3. Scroll to the very very bottom.  Change all the en's to your language code: module.exports = **en**;

4. Save it.

5. Open translate.js (in that same folder).

6. Copy line 2 and paste it right below that line. Change all the en's to your language code: var **en** = require('./**en**');

7. Copy line 11 and paste it right below that line. Change all the en's to your language code: $translateProvider.translations(**en**.code, translate.marked(**en**.data));

8. Now you can go back to the first file you edited and translate away and open a PR when you are done!

Alright! Let's see how this goes!

Holy crap. You guys are on fire. I was worried when I posted this - I had no idea what to expect. Now I am super excited!!!!!!

Ethereum nodes with insecure RPC settings are actively exploited,"Today I setup a small honeypot which simulates an Ethereum node with its HTTP RPC API exposed to the internet.

The honeypot forwards save RPC calls to a backend node and responds to certain calls like ""eth_accounts"" and ""eth_sendTransaction"" with data that make the node seem vulnerable. You can find the honeypot code [here](https://gist.github.com/anonymous/5632b5ca21f4d2f29994cd940e79df59).

Within **a few minutes** after bringing the honeypot online an attacker tried to steal funds. The attack has the following pattern:

* First the attacker calls *eth_getBlockByNumber(""0x00"", false)*
* After that the attacker retrieves a list of accounts with the *eth_account* calls
* The the attacker issues several eth_sendTransaction calls for each of the retrieved account where all account funds are swept to a target address ([0x96a5296eb1d8f8098d35f300659c95f7d6362d15](https://etherchain.org/account/0x96a5296eb1d8f8098d35f300659c95f7d6362d15) in this case).

This pattern is repeated over and over again and eth_sendTransaction calls are issued approximately every second, most likely to catch a moment when the account is unlocked.

As the [balance](https://etherchain.org/account/0x96a5296eb1d8f8098d35f300659c95f7d6362d15) of this account is already at ~50 Ether the attacker seems to be successfully with this tactic.

Thus I would emphasize again the advice to never, ever allow access to the HTTP RPC API via the internet. Currently all Ethereum clients limit access to the HTTP RPC API by default.",72.0,2016-08-22 13:56:42,0.96

A few of the transactions are settled in the schools ERP/CRM platform and they all work fine, but many others are being doing in cash.

At first they were thinking and some sort of magnetic stripe thing, they used and example what they saw in some amusement park where you must get a rechargeable credit card that you load with tokens.

I talked to them about crypto based currencies and they are interested because of different reasons.

One of them likes the idea of not needing a big IT infrastructure deployment, the other wants to make a case to brag about in international high school heads conferences and the other are just meh, they don't care about the backend, they just want to speed up the buying process removing the giving change part.

How will Casper select validators and avoid centralisation?,"As I understand it, the way Casper's proof of stake implementation will work is that upto 250 ""validators"" are selected to determine which blocks have consensus through rounds of betting.

In order to become one of these 250 validators, you have to stake a minimum of 1250 ETH (assuming you're the only validator), all the way up to 312,500 ETH each assuming there are all 250 validator positions taken. Since this would require 78m of 83m ETH in existence to be staked, and evenly distributed between validators, this 250 validator limit will likely not be reached.

This means becoming a validator will NOT be an option for the vast majority of Ethereum users, since the stake requirements, and likely hardware requirements are so high.

It strikes me that this will create even more centralising pressure than with PoW. If you want to mine on PoW you can even mine off your inefficient CPU without holding any currency.

For the vast majority who want to see a return under PoS, they would be forced to pool their stakes together in order to become validators.

I also note that the 'betting' algorithm will mean two validators at any time will be selected to create new blocks, and then a series of bets will determine which block is the winner.

This process seems to dependend on everyone running the same software. If you have a large pool, what is to stop them running slightly modified software, that is aware of the ""expected"" behaviour by other participants, and can manipulate their betting to give it a slight edge.

This only needs to be a tiny advantage, like a house edge in a casino, where they lose often, but gain say a 1% edge overall. Pools can guarantee their members an edge by pooling their resources, getting the best hardware, the best developers, and doing everything in their power to gain an edge.

Could this create a slippery slope into even further centralisation, an arms race between increasingly larger pools to increase their edge in the betting, and increase the returns from and consequently size of their pool.

What steps are being taken to mitigate this pooling and centralisation risk?

I saw a few comments in the article at https://blog.ethereum.org/2016/03/05/serenity-poc2/ raising concerns, but the developers have remained silent as far as I've been able to tell.

A good question there was how do you prevent a validator from becoming a validator after their year, without breaking fungibility?

Is there already working implementation of a stable (USD or EUR based) ETH token?,"We are working on an Ethereum project for sustainable investments. It is mostly focused on solar energy at the moment. I can assume that the early adopters (I mean the Ethereum community itself and investors with whom we are working directly) will be fine with the ETH volatility. Finally, if we are succesful with our project and as it seems there are quite some others coming soon too, the price of ETH will most probably rise. 


However, our ultimate goal is to attract the external investors. We want to bring completely new set of users into the Ethereum. Here comes the ""problem"". They might have little (if at all) idea about the Ethereum, the very few of them (again, if any at all) can accept the volatility of ETH. Their main objective is to simply get an additional income on Fiat money (besides an idea to bring more sustainability into our world).

How to go from n00b to decent Solidity coder?,"Greetings,

"Augur and Gnosis allow anyone anywhere to invest in companies without revealing their identity, while at the same time helping the companies financially","I'm not sure if this was stated explicitly before, but I came to an interesting realization.

The prediction market allows people, who let’s say live in China, or don’t want to reveal their identity, to invest in companies listed on the stock market. So for example, you live in China. You can invest in Tesla anonymously through Gnosis or Augur - and by invest I mean your money will end up in Elon Musk's bank account.

Let's think about how this works. When a Chinese citizen bets on Tesla stock price going up on Augur, this raises the probability of Tesla price going up. Which means it makes it more favorable to bet against Tesla stock price going up on Augur. So now some American trader can see that there is a hedging opportunity. He can buy some Tesla shares on E-Trade and at the same time bet on Tesla price going down on Augur. Which will guarantee (or almost guarantee) profit. When the American trader does this, the probability estimate goes down to roughly the level it was before the Chinese citizen wanted to invest and the price of Tesla shares (on Nasdaq) goes up. Tesla can now use the extra money to invest in projects. Augur, the American trader and E-Trade played a role of an intermediary in the transaction, but through these series of steps, it’s equivalent to the Chinese citizen giving $100 to Elon must directly.",42.0,2016-08-20 03:18:12,0.86
ETC withdraw contract to be reviewed,"The White Hat Group has continued the development of the smart contracts and supporting code that will enable the DAO Token Holders to withdraw the recovered ETC, and has reached a point where they are ready to be reviewed.

[https://github.com/BitySA/whetcwithdraw](https://github.com/BitySA/whetcwithdraw)

There is no precise timeframe for their deployment, though we would like it to be as soon as possible. These contracts need a thorough community audit. Please review the ReadMe section in the GitHub repo and create issues as needed.

The most important things to review are:

* whetcwithdraw.sol which will be the withdraw contract that will be deployed in the ETC chain.
* Daobalance directory, containing the dao_balance_snapshot.sol contract and the script that generates the data.  This is populated from the ETH chain but is deployed in the ETC chain and contains the DAO Token Holder balances at the time of the hard fork. This contract is already deployed and filled with data in the ETC chain at 0x180826b05452ce96e157f0708c43381fee64a6b8. You can test it live using the following interface in geth:

    var daobalancesnapshot_abi = [{""constant"":true,""inputs"":[],""name"":""totalSupply"",""outputs"":[{""name"":"""",""type"":""uint256""}],""type"":""function""},{""constant"":false,""inputs"":[],""name"":""seal"",""outputs"":[],""type"":""function""},{""constant"":true,""inputs"":[],""name"":""totalAccounts"",""outputs"":[{""name"":"""",""type"":""uint256""}],""type"":""function""},{""constant"":true,""inputs"":[{""name"":"""",""type"":""address""}],""name"":""balanceOf"",""outputs"":[{""name"":"""",""type"":""uint256""}],""type"":""function""},{""constant"":false,""inputs"":[{""name"":""data"",""type"":""uint256[]""}],""name"":""fill"",""outputs"":[],""type"":""function""},{""constant"":true,""inputs"":[],""name"":""owner"",""outputs"":[{""name"":"""",""type"":""address""}],""type"":""function""},{""constant"":true,""inputs"":[],""name"":""sealed"",""outputs"":[{""name"":"""",""type"":""bool""}],""type"":""function""},{""inputs"":[],""type"":""constructor""}];
    var daobalancesnapshot = web3.eth.contract(daobalancesnapshot_abi).at(""0x180826b05452ce96e157f0708c43381fee64a6b8"");
          daobalancesnapshot.balanceOf(YOURACCOUNTHERE);


* Crosswithdraw.sol which will be the withdraw contract deployed in the ETH chain, to allow people who can not or do not want to sync the ETC chain. They will be able to provide an ETC withdraw address (e.g. an exchange deposit address) directly after proving ownership in the ETH chain and thus get their ETC without ever syncing the chain.

"HELP, LOST 3000 ETHER trying to split","Dear Ethereum community,

I'm reaching out in desperation after a week of trying to retrieve 3176 ETH I lost last weekend trying to dump my ETC on Kraken.

What happened:

I had 3176 ETH sitting in a cold storage wallet prior to the hard fork. Last saturday I decided it was time to try remove my ETC to Kraken so I could sell them.

To make sure I was not moving my ETH I sent a small test transaction of 0.5 ETC to the kraken address 0x269baa6924ee0c3d4e64d51952dfd6b346604b47 using the send ETC only option on myetherwallet.com. 

I watched my ETC balance go down on the right hand side and my ETH balance remain, so I proceeded to send 2500 ETC and 676 ETC in 2 more transactions and they play out the same as the test transaction. It was only when I loaded my wallet back up the next day that it displayed my ETH balance drained and transactions on both blockchains. 

Neither myetherwallet or Kraken have been of any real assistance in the matter so I'm reaching out to the community.

I was attempting to only move the ETC from my address to Kraken, using myetherwallet.com and selecting an ETC only transfer.

The only address I input for the transaction was the Kraken address, having a look at etherscan I can see that the ETH were moved into a ""safesplit"" contract which I assume the purpose of is to avoid this very situation.

If anyone can shed light on this situation, how my ETH ended up at https://etherscan.io/address/0xf0b88a6b17226075241b2a38f70c20078760ca08. through some ""internal transactions"" and how I can retrieve them that would be greatly appreciated.

This is an enourmous loss for me, 95% of my holdings and has real world consequences 

EDIT: I just got access to the computer I was on when this all went down... myetherswallet.com in the browser history. I can now confirm that I have been fucked by a phishing attack. I still don't understand 100% how it went down as the ETC ended up in the right spot but that being in my history is enough to confirm I will never be seeing it again.

As a long time non technical enthusiast this is extremely disheartening, this was the only accumulation of wealth I had gained and my ticket to freedom. I had tried so hard to protect it. 

I know there will be plenty out there who are like its your own fault for not checking url etc and I normally wouldn't even use that website but my Geth client wouldn't sync and there has been so many changes from hard fork I was afraid of losing it there too. I had kept it in cold storage on an offline laptop and had even ordered a ledger nano S to store it on (which arrived Monday). how fucking paranoid do you have to be to not experience devastating loss in this enviroment",29.0,2016-08-19 07:47:08,0.91
Pondering the disruptive power of Ethereum,"Sometimes I forget just how disruptive Ethereum could be. Nothing here will be new to anyone, but try to step back and experience this from the perspective of someone who has no idea about blockchains or Ethereum:

Because of Ethereum a 12 year old kid could create and sell shares in their own company to a global audience on a network that is possibly [more secure than the Nasdaq](http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2014-07-17/how-russian-hackers-stole-the-nasdaq) and has [more uptime than the NYSE](http://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/09/business/dealbook/new-york-stock-exchange-suspends-trading.html), right from their laptop, potentially in a manner of minutes and only costing a few dollars.

Because of Ethereum this 12 year old kid could launch their own worldwide IPO without the need for grand and expensive financial, legal, or governmental infrastructure, from the comfort of their mother's basement.

The 12 year old kid could then transact and do business in a fully digital currency that protects him or her from fraud and identity theft, on a platform that never sleeps, fully settles payments in seconds, and costs far less than VISA or other major payment processors to use (but of course is only used by a small percentage of crypto enthusiasts for the time being, limiting their market reach) and without needing a bank account.

That 12 year old kid could then use some of their money to diversify their portfolio by purchasing shares in other companies through DAOs, letting him or her vote as a board member on critical issues and receive dividends if these companies become profitable. That 12 year old kid can do this all without needing money managers or accountants taking high fees for the pleasure of brokering the deals on their behalf or advising them on investment decisions.

All this can be done with Ethereum now, today. Just imagine what will be possible in a few years.

*****

*I realize people might point to TheDAO as evidence Ethereum is not secure, or just to troll. I'm not saying Ethereum or contracts on Ethereum are unhackable. I'm pointing out that we know modern exchanges have been hacked so Ethereum is at least as secure as them, and of course has the potential to be more secure.*

*****

**EDIT - Follow up thoughts**
As interesting as the replies have been to this post, I think some may have latched on a little too literally to my 12 year old phrase. My intention was to highlight the difference between the massive infrastructure, capital, and connections that are required for a person to launch an IPO on an exchange and how Ethereum replaces much of that infrastructure in a way that makes it so incredibly easy that ""even a 12 year old could do it"". My intention wasn't to give the impression that we have an overabundance of kids selling shares in their lemonade stands using Ethereum. Remember the old Geico commercials? So easy a caveman could do it? They weren't really trying to sell car insurance to Cro-magnons.",26.0,2016-08-19 06:19:46,0.87

## Tracking the stolen funds from myetherSwallet . com and myetherwallet . ca

Notes

- myetherSwallet . com & myetherwallet . ca are one in the same. They are the ones who have been running Google Ads for MyEtherWallet.

- They currently are running a phishing scam @ mymonero . co (SSL Certs are the same)

- They are the same group who ran Kraken phishing ads and blockchain.info phishing ads.

- They guys got in touch with us today via email (pretty much the best thing ever.) They sent the email from hongbao776@126.com, which is the same email that they have on the myetherSwallet . com WHOIS information. They also confirmed that the 0x412b address is his….by asking us to send him 15k ETH. lulz.

Upcoming changes in Solidity 0.4.0,"The upcoming 0.4.0 release of Solidity will include various breaking changes, most of them concerning safety. The following are already implemented (note that browser-solidity now defaults to the latest _released_ version, and not to the nightly builds, so if you want to use those features, you have to manually select a newer version):

 * we removed the confusing and undocumented ""after"" keyword
 * exceptions will now be thrown if contract creation fails or a regular function is called on a non-existing contract
 * ecrecover now returns zero for incorrectly formatted input
 * modifiers are required to contain \_ and it is no longer possible to skip the part after \_ (it was previously by using ""return"") - this allows mutexes to be implemented properly
 * division by zero throws an exception

Other breaking changes that are still in development:

 * functions reject ether by default and require the new ""payable"" modifier if they want to accept it
 * lots of improvements to the AST output (thanks to @asinyagin !)
 * warning about calling a function on ""this"" in the constructor
 * source files now have to explicitly specify the Solidity version they want to use to guard against future breaking changes: pragma solidity ""\^0.4.0""; - the version can be given in any npm-style semver ""match expression"".

We would also like to throw an exception on arithmetic overflow, but that will probably only be ready in 0.5.0.

Use of the r/eth subreddit and How can we make eth a viable everyday currency.,"Hey guys I'm the head mod of r/eth . The subreddit was inactive because of an absent mod but I've just received head mod status of the subreddit and will be reviving it.

I think the use of eth as an everyday currency and means of transaction is very lacking compared to bitcoin. So I think maybe r/eth should be used as a place to spearhead the adoption of eth as an everyday method of transaction. 

If you have a better idea for the use of the r/eth subreddit feel free to share it.

Feel free to send me any suggestions or post them yourself in r/eth. Thanks for your time.",42.0,2016-08-18 09:05:51,0.84
Rex goes live on main-net,"We are excited to announce our 'soft launch' of the Rex platform onto Ethereum main net.  We have launched with our planned zero-token release, this means certain functionality is purposefully difficult to use right now.

To obtain REX tokens you can try place an order on the RexDex to try win the liquidity injection reward, otherwise buy them from anyone selling.  Its important to note that the supply of new REX tokens via this mechanism is currently very slow at 10 REX per 6 hours.

The built-in 'Seed round' Token Swap contract is active and counting down, kicking off in around 7 days on the 24th-25th.  There are roughly 5 Million REX up for grabs during this Token Swap, initially held as non transferable reward points, we plan to activate the claims process (conversion to REX) in about 3-6 months once the platform goes live proper.

Our goal with this soft launch is to slowly build confidence and value in the platform over time, rather than risk large amounts of value from the get go.  This should give us a chance to fix any bugs before distributing large amounts of REX.

As such, any major bugs found may require a full upgrade of the platform and the potential for loss of tokens.  Once the platform is more stable the contracts will be 'locked' and further upgrades will require community consensus to enact.

You can find the main net version here http://live.rexmls.com/ where you'll be able to participate in the Token Swap.

Or if you want to play around on the testnet where there are more TestREX tokens, you can go to http://testnet.rexmls.com/

I'm sure you have many questions, please ask here or head over to our chat channel at https://gitter.im/rex-mls/rexchat and say hello.",37.0,2016-08-18 03:15:53,0.92

Simple Idea for StableCoin,"This post is a simpler implementation of the third option in /u/vbuterin/'s recent post (https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/4xtd9z/stabler_coins/). 

For simplicity sakes, let's assume a current ETH price of US$ 10.

It would go like this:

1. At any time, anyone could transfer 2 ETH to the Stable Smart Contract and receive 1 TurboETH10 and 1 TurboUSD10.

2. Conversely, at any time, you could transfer 1 TurboETH10 to the Stable Smart Contract and get US$ 10 + 2 x (P-10) worth of ETH, where P is the current ETH price; and you could also transfer 1 TurboUSD10 and get back US$ 10 worth of ETH. 

3. If ETH falls and reaches 10/2 (i.e., 5), TurboUSD10 receives the 2 ETH backs, while TurboETH10 is left with nothing.

In summary, one token is always equal to a fixed USD amount, while the other token is a leveraged ETH without the high lending fees of exchanges.

What do you guys think?
Comments and suggestions are welcomed!",27.0,2016-08-16 00:09:03,0.88
Stabler coins,"One interesting set of ideas in the ""stablecoin"" area has to do with systems that do not try to perfectly provide price stability, but which do try to at least marginally improve conditions in this regard over the ""Bitcoin/ether baseline"". Stablecoins targeting perfect dollar parity (or euro parity, CNY parity, SDR parity, or some kind of decentralized CPI parity) have been criticized for (i) relying on a source of outside information on the value of the target in question, and hence either being centralized or being vulnerable to manipulation, (ii) being unable to handle large, sudden and permanent _decreases_ in demand (or generally market shocks), and (iii) being vulnerable to ""speculative attacks"" where attackers short the currency in very large volumes, eventually breaking the peg and profiting from the massive resulting fall in price and. (i) and (iii) are possibly both quite solvable even in the perfect parity setting, and (ii) can be mitigated with high collateral requirements; however, for those who are uncomfortable with the reliability or the capital lockup costs of such models, and for those who _want_ some profit potential but with a risk profile closer to a large company stock than to a cryptocurrency there is an opportunity for a ""coin"" that takes a middle path.

Option 1: **the PoW-based stabler coin**

This is based on the ""bounded difficulty estimator"" technique from [here](https://blog.ethereum.org/2014/11/11/search-stable-cryptocurrency/), and incorporates a concept of one-way monetary policy. One simple set of rules is as follows:

* Normally, X coins are issued per year (where X may be decreasing according to some schedule)
* If the difficulty grows by more than 2x in some time period (say, six months), then increase the issuance by a factor to compensate for the excess (eg. if difficulty grows by 5x in six months, increase issuance by 2.5x)

To see why this works, let us work through an example. Suppose that the price and difficulty rise suddenly by a factor of 2, and then by another factor of 2. As a result, issuance should increase by 2x. However, this itself depresses price, so the equilibrium would be for issuance to increase by ~1.41x and price by ~1.41x (where difficulty would still increase 2x). You may worry about a cascade effect where increasing issuance leads to runaway growing inflation, but the fact that price expectations decrease if such a cascade starts occurring effectively prevents it from happening in the first place.

While allowing for both steady growth and technological improvement, this algorithm creates a cap on the upside of a cryptocurrency, preventing its price from going ""to the moon"" too quickly as if price rises too far then difficulty will rise too, forcing the compensator to kick in. Now, it might seem like this is a strictly undesirable formula to have: it takes away the upside, but if adoption _decreases_, it does nothing to take away the downside. However, this is not in fact true. The reason is that whereas sudden price rises are due to the expectation of large increases in adoption (it's always expectation, not actual adoption; adoption is predictable in advance far enough that price rises are almost never _directly_ caused by people buying coins for personal use en masse), sudden price _drops_ are quite often due to that expectation being _taken away_. However, if expectations of greatly increased adoption only increase price moderately, then reduced expectations of adoption should also decrease price only moderately.

The above is a fairly strict approach to price control, taking away ~50% of potential gains (and hence hopefully close to ~50% of potential losses). But there is also a more moderate approach:

* X coins are issued per year (where X may be decreasing according to some schedule)
* Every time difficulty hits a new 2**k value for the first time, release an additional Y coins

This may be appealing to some cryptocurrency enthusiasts because it retains the property that it has a fixed supply cap (as the annual issuance schedule can have a finite sum just like bitcoin, and the second issuance component is effectively capped at ~30 * Y if parameters are set appropriately, as the difference between an appropriate initial difficulty and a ""world domination"" scenario is likely well under a factor of a billion). It also works well with a Zcash-style ""delayed founder premine"" scenario as the founders' share can be designed ONLY as a share of the Y component, effectively giving the founders a superlinear interest in the currency succeeding, where if it does not succeed enough to trigger issuance bursts their returns are effectively zero.

Option 2: **the Seignorage Shares-based stabler coin**

Now, suppose that we are doing proof of stake (or an asset on top of _another_ PoW blockchain) and so we do not have access to mining as either a way of measuring price increases or as a distribution model. Suppose that the problem of measuring price in a decentralized way is solved. We can use [Seignorage Shares](https://github.com/rmsams/stablecoins) as a distribution model, but without sticking to any kind of absolute peg. Instead, what we can do is have some number of ""coins"" up for auction evenly across all price levels (ie. there are 10000 coins to be sold for $1.00 worth of shares per coin, 10000 coins to be sold for $1.01 worth of shares per coin, etc), and have a market where coins can be sold back - if all of the coins from $0 to $1.25 have been sold, then there would be an opportunity to sell back 10000 coins at $1.25, 10000 coins at $1.24, etc. Note that this is essentially a revenue-neutral market maker; we can also charge a spread (say, a 0.5% fee on selling coins back to the system for shares) and thereby make the scheme profitable.

This kind of scheme is harder to financially exploit, as (i) it does not try to maintain an absolute peg, instead maintaining a ""pressure"" toward price stability that we can expect to take away roughly ~50% of a cryptocurrency's price volatility, (ii) has a compelling mathematical argument for why it would not ""break"", and (iii) creates a role for speculators who are willing to protect the currency by buying it up on the cheap during an attack and profit from this.

Option 3: **the self-rebalancing portfolio coin**

This approach is inspired by collateralized debt obligations, and tries to get price stability in a different way. Essentially, we break up a volatile asset with prior price P into pieces A and B, where if the asset has a posterior price P', then we target `price(A) = min(P', P / 2)` and `price(B) = max(0, P' - P / 2)`. Essentially, A is the ""bottom slice"" and B is the ""top slice"". We enforce this using the following scheme:

* Every epoch (say, 1 epoch = 1 hour), we record the prior price, P.
* Anyone at any time can convert 1 unit of the underlying asset into 1 A + 1 B, and anyone can convert back.
* At the end of the epoch, suppose that the new price is P', where `price(A) / P' = x` and `price(B) / P' = y` according to the formulas above (where `x + y = 1`). Multiply A-holders' holdings by `x * 2` and B-holders' holdings by `y * 2`. Rinse and repeat.

The last step can be viewed as the protocol automatically making an operation where (i) A and B holders' holdings are settled in terms of the underlying asset (A holders should get `x` and B holders should get `y`), (ii) these holdings of the underlying asset are immediately re-split into A and B, and (iii) those who held A automatically sell their B to those who held B at fair market price and vice versa.

Unless the underlying asset drops by more than a factor of 2 during an epoch, this ensures purchasing power stability for A holders; if we want to convert this into a token with price stability (ie. users don't see changes in the _quantity_ of their holdings), we can create a simple DAO that holds A, and whose shares represent a constant share of its (fluctuating) A holdings. Alternatively, we can _pretend_ to do this, instead baking this functionality into the underlying contract by making the convertibility rate be 1 asset = x A + y B where x and y change as needed; this may actually be simplest to implement, because there is no need to loop through balances and increment all of them proportionately when you can instead just separately store the proportionality constant.

If the underlying asset does drop by more than a factor of 2, then A holders do suffer to some extent, but this is ok; the point was never to provide a perfect guarantee, only an approximate one. The scheme can be generalized to an arbitrary number of tranches tranches; eg. one can even do something like a five-tranche scheme with A = 0-33%, B = 33-67%, C = 67-100%, D = 100-200%, E = 200%+.

IMO it would be interesting to implement some of these on top of ethereum (eg. one can easily make the A/B scheme above on top of ether itself), although it's also important to come up with the tooling to make these systems liquid enough for practical usage, including decentralized exchange dapps, market makers, etc; I'd like to be able to purchase some ""bottom-tranche ether"" and hold it as a stablecoin just as easily as I can move between ether and bitcoin themselves. Coming up with a reasonably trustworthy decentralized oracle is also important; I quite like the recent [proposal by Edmund Edgar](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/4xg2v4/an_arbitration_layer_for_ethereum_with_a_hard/) though we should probably try a few different ones.",123.0,2016-08-15 12:44:47,0.89
Swarm-Redistribution: Universal Basic Income Through Perpetuum Mobile “Positive Pyramid Schemes” — Steemit,"Written a blog post about a project I work on, which uses [**Taxemes**](https://bitnation.co/blog/using-a-genetic-algorithm-for-self-organising-emergent-tax-rates-in-a-crypto-basic-income-system/) and [**dividend pathways**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxyjt2T_nLQ) to experiment with [**decentralized wealth redistribution**](https://blog.p2pfoundation.net/resilience-decentralized-basic-income-through-paying-it-forward/2016/05/19), using the Ethereum computer as the state-machine.

The blog-post is about the idea that _pyramid schemes_ could be defined as decentralized and voluntary wealth transfer systems, where people participate for the promise of profit, and no one does any work besides ""infecting others to join"". The idea originally came from Nathan Waters.

If pyramid schemes are viewed as a _technology_, then perhaps they be evolved into something that does decentralized wealth transfer but in a sustainable way, a perpetuum mobile _wealth sharing_ system.

No, once created, it is no longer yours nor under your control, just like a trend (memes) or a child (genes) or a technology (temes)

**Explain further**

""personal Taxeme"" is what adds **variation** to Taxemes. this lets networks of people select Taxemes in the same way people select trends. Once a person has unleashed a trend onto the world, they may change their mind and could choose to express other trends instead, and Taxemes work the same way

"ELI5 or Infographic request: Where is the ETH, ETC and DAO tokens on both forks and how did they get there? White hats, Robin hoods, attackers, splits, child DAOs -- OH MY! I need some boxes and some arrows, starting a bounty","It's getting worse than Game of Thrones with all these actors and accounts and forks! **I got a $10 ChangeTip if someone can really break it down for me,** and I assume a visual aid would probably be helpful to lots of other community members as well?

 I understand the DAO vulnerability and how the first recursive drain-attack worked. I mostly understand the hard fork replaced the DAO contract with a refund contract and, what else? Moved all the attacker's funds back into it...? Now there's posts about the group that recovered ETC from the DAO attacker on the classic fork? I thought the ETC-attacker moved his ETC out of his child-split? Were the white hats able to steal from the attacker in a way he can steal back?

Edit: graphic in progrerss!

"Dai Stablecoin, Prediction Markets and Paul Sztorc","One of the main hindrances to mainstream acceptance of cryptocurrency is the volatility, and one large problem in the mainstream economy is currency fluctuations - so why not solve both problems at the same time? 

Enter the search for a stablecoin or a mechanism that has the same function. The stakes are truly huge, the winner will have their flag planted on one of the commanding heights in the post-blockchain financial economy.

One proposed method is the Dai stablecoin currently under development by MakerDAO. The Dai value is guaranteed by being collateralized in excess of its real time value, and the stability is ensured by the stablecoin having an official target value and then using Dai traders to enforce this value by trading the Dai as it vibrates on the target value.

The second method, proposed by Paul Sztorc at Hivemind, is to use a blockchain prediction market to hedge cryptocurrencies against fiat currencies such as the US dollar (USD).

Example:
Bob and Alice both exchange USD for a fistful of crypto and are looking to bet on sports events. Both Bob and Alice are way too fond of serious betting and need to fix the financial gains or losses versus USD in order to be able to pay the rent next month. Bob heads to a prediction market, places his bet in Dai and hedges against USD. Alice goes straight to the prediction market, places her bet in her favorite crypto Bitcoin and then hedges bitcoin vs USD. 

Do note that we assume all markets to be up and running with full functionality.

Comparing the methods yield identical results, both Alice and Bob need to perform the same number of steps: fiat/crypto, make bet, hedge and lastly crypto/fiat. This was obviously not the answer we were looking for so we need to think again. What was one of our assumptions? Ah - fully functioning markets. 

I will now leave the textbook economics that always assumes fully functional markets in perfect competition and move over to the rough and tumble of real life markets. Examples of imperfect markets in crypto just over the last few weeks would be the TheDAO event, Ethereum Classic and the rise of Steem. If you still believe in perfect markets after these events I cannot help you further and only life's accumulated experiences will possibly open your eyes.

The key difference between Bob and Alice in a situation with imperfect markets is the robustness of their financial position. Since many of Bob and Alice's steps are identical we shall only look at the differences. Bob makes a bet in Dai, Alice in Bitcoins. Dai is bound extremely tight to a basket of quality fiat currencies such as USD and EUR (see SDR below). In comparison, Bitcoin often rollercoasts +/-10% against USD daily, with other crypto currencies often varying even more. Because Dai is stable, Bob can make larger bets, because he knows what he is betting. Alice, which has put down bitcoins, will not know exactly how much she is risking and will therefore want to risk less.

This is exactly where the hedging comes in which will allow Alice to make bets the same size as Bob's. Let us see how that works out: Bob hedges Dai versus USD which is not really much of a hedge since the Dai is 41.73% USD already. In other words both cheap to hedge and highly liquid. Alice however needs to hedge the far more volatile BTC, which due to the volatility involved will be far riskier for the hedge counterparty. Hedging Bitcoins will accordingly be more expensive and less liquid. 

Comparing the two methods in imperfect markets therefore yield a very different result. Bob using Dai will now have higher returns compared to Alice that is using Bitcoins. The difference will be even more pronounced around major market events when hedging against fiat, or anything else, will simply not be available.

TL;DR / CONCLUSION: In a theoretical situation with perfect markets use of the stablecoin Dai and prediction market hedging will yield the same financial results. When abandoning the idea of perfect markets we see that use of the Dai stablecoin and prediction market hedging will lead to higher profit compared to use of prediction markets only.

Follow Up Statement on the ETC Salvaged from attackDAOs,"Following the events of the last 24 hours we want to keep the community updated:

After having received repeated legal threats from various individuals holding significant stakes in The DAO (still continuing), we sought legal advice to help us pursue our goal without endangering ourselves or the salvaged funds. We found support and legal advice from Bity SA, a trusted Swiss entity. It has agreed to protect, secure and later distribute the funds equitably under an independent Swiss legal structure. The number 1 goal has always been to ensure that the salvaged funds are distributed in a fair, transparent and just manner. This remains unchanged.

When the salvaged ETC were able to be recovered, signals were received from the greater community to distribute these ETC in ETH, to continue to support Ethereum projects. Also, a large portion of the community does not have the technical ability to safely work both with ETC and ETH in the same address; therefore, returning part of salvaged ETC in ETH seemed to be the safest for all the parties involved. The first actions from the Swiss structure took place Tuesday August 9th and it preferred to not announce the movement of ETC in advance to avoid speculators taking advantage of the situation. Part of these funds are still on exchanges and the rest of the funds are held in the following accounts: 
 
 
ETC Multisig: 0x1ac729d2db43103faf213cb9371d6b42ea7a830f 

ETH Multisig: 0xd3b0b4fc31ee1f8570c75c19caa93cc1557e538f 

BTC Multisig: 3JYwxuaHGKt8rZ9NbTEcyYRXtqkfN5Lz5Y 

BTC Multisig2: 3Er3uMqBruv8VnhXUjyRbp2McASUE8t9HA
 
 
It has now become clear that this approach will introduce many unnecessary complications and wouldn’t bring certainty to all DAO Token Holders that they would be treated equally and with fairness. The objective evolved from the most desirable outcome (distributing ETH and ETC) to the most efficient and comprehensible distribution solution, that all funds will be made available in ETC to the DAO Token Holders. To achieve this, all exchanges will be asked to return the funds to the Multisig wallets.

We would like to thank the community for their trust and ask for their patience as the responsibility of returning this value to the DAO Token Holders is not an easy task. We are under a lot of pressure, but throughout this process we will continue to do the best that we can to protect the interests of the DAO Token Holders.

All the legal and technical work of the community members and the companies involved, has always been on a volunteer and pro-bono basis. Following our first statement, members of the community have expressed their keenness to donate crypto assets in recognition for the efforts deployed to salvage the ETC from the attackDAOs and to distribute it back to the community. Accordingly, it will be possible to donate when retrieving the funds. We will communicate next with a detailed plan for the distribution.

Some thinking about Ethereum,"A.Overcome some challenges of using blockchain technology now

A1. Waste of energy.
     Casper，Casper is a security-deposit based economic consensus protocol. This means that nodes, so called bonded validators, have to place a security deposit, an action called bonding, in order to serve the consensus by producing blocks. In Casper style proof of stake anyone can participate in block production by posting a bond. After posting a bond you have an opportunity to bet on which block will be included next. The incentives are such that you make money by betting with the eventual consensus and lose money by betting against the consensus. Any crypto-graphically provable misbehavior results in the forfeit of the bond. An analogy can be made to proof of work where each miner is betting with their hash power on which block will be accepted. If they bet wrong then any block they produce will be orphaned causing them to lose money.
       About long range attack, nothing at stake, 51% attack, double-finality, recovery from netsplits and recovery from mass crash-failure，researchers of Casper have already  come up with some ideas to solve them. Capser now is in POC3 and backbone simulations have achieved 3s block time. The risk of implementation is lower. The launch schedule maybe is in the first half of next year. 

A2. Blockchain scalability issues.
     Sharding, Shard is a concept not so much related to the Proof-Of-Stake, but rather to the scalability improvement. The idea of 'sharding' is to split the space of possible accounts (contracts are accounts too) into subspaces, for example, based on first digits of their numerical addresses. Each shard gets its own set of validators (therefore PoS is a pre-requisite), and these validators will not normally need to validate all the shards. Messages (transactions) between the accounts within the same shard would work in the same way as they work today.
       Sharding will increase the potential transaction throughput from ~10-20 transactions per second to over 100000 (or, if super-quadratic versions are used, a theoretically unlimited number). Implementation of a simple binary sharding scheme in Ethereum (EIP 105) will be launched together with Casper，the risk of implementation is low.

A3. No privacy on the Blockchain.
      zkSNARKs，zk-SNARKs are the cryptographic tool underlying  Zcash. They are proofs that you have performed a computation over some inputs without revealing all of the inputs. Zcash uses these proofs to verify transactions while protecting users' privacy. Ethereum will extend the contract language to efficiently support verification of zkSNARK proofs. Specifically, maybe add a precompile opcode to verify generic proofs. Over the last week, Zcashers Vitalik Buterin, Andrew Miller, Eran Tromer and Sean Bowe have been at the Ethereum/IC3 Bootcamp at Cornell. At the event, They brought zkSNARKs to Ethereum for the first time. zkSNARKs is a third party project，now move forward steadily and can integrate smoothly with Ethereum contract. The risk of implementation is low. The schedule is maybe next year. Following the crowdfunding opportunity of this project.

A4. High costs and slower speed for small payments.
     Raiden, Raiden is similar to the proposed Bitcoin Lightning Network. it scales linearly with the number of participants (1,000,000+ transfers per second possible). Transfers are confirmed and final within the fraction of a second. Single transfers don’t show up in the global shared ledger. Transaction fees can be 7 orders of magnitude lower than on the blockchain. Low transaction fees allow to efficiently transfer tiny values. Ethereum has just announced POC0 of Raiden. The risk of implementation is low. The schedule is maybe next year.

B.	Building the decentralized web 3.0
                      
                   (picture)

Contracts:  Decentralized logic. WebAssembly release faster  virtual machine expected in 2017.

Swarm:  Decentralized storage integrated with Ethereum name serive. Now is in POC2 RC3，expected in  
             2017.The risk  of implementation is low.

Whisper: Decentralized messaging. I cannot find further information by now. 

Mist: Mist is Dapps brower and will be launched before 2017. The risk of implementation is low.

C. Interaction with outside of the Ethereum ecosystem.

1、BTCrelay， A bridge between the Bitcoin blockchain and Ethereum smart contracts，BTC Relay has launched and now is live on mainnet. 

2、Truebit，Using the TrueBit project, smart contract can actually ask external programs to execute routines for them in a trustless manner.This is a third party project. Dr. Christian Reitwiessner from Ethereum said our first goal was to make this all work for scrypt (so the dogecoin - ethereum two-way-peg becames a reality) where the long-term idea was to allow arbitrary programs written in C/C++/Rust to be able to be called from your smart contracts. Schedule and risk need further evaluation. Following the crowdfunding opportunity of this project.

3、Oraclize，Smart contracts live like in a walled garden,they cannot fetch external data on their own. Oraclize act as a data carrier,a reliable connection between Web APIs and Ethereum Dapps. There is no need to open additional trustlines. Schedule and risk of this project need further evaluation. Following the crowdfunding opportunity. 

D.  There are 275 projects around Ethereum listed in dapps.ethercasts.com. It is the permissionless and turing-completeness of Ethereum that allows all of these projects to seamlessly integrate with each other, increasing the value and utility of each other. Each project becomes a multiplier on the existing value of Ethereum ecosystem, resulting in exponential, rather than linear gains. 

E.  The developer team and foundation of Ethereum have innovative spirits and vision with long-term technical planning for Ethereum. Although there have been some developers who left the team, but most of them have not left the community, are still engaged in the projects in the Ethereum ecosystem.

F.  There's a lot to look forward to in the rest of year 2016. Devcon2 in September will be held in Shanghai; The third phase of the Ethereum named Metropolis will be released; Augur decentralized prediction market built on the Ethereum blockchain likely will be launched; Gnosis and the Golem project built on Ethereum will raise money through crowdsales.

## What is Ethereum?

Ethereum is a cutting edge blockchain-based distributed computing platform, featuring smart contract functionality. It provides a decentralized virtual machine, the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), that can execute peer-to-peer contracts using a cryptocurrency called ether.

JavaScript Ethereum Library Release (ethers-wallet),"Hey all,

My JavaScript *Ethereum* library is finally ready for semi-general consumption.

Features:

* All-in-one JavaScript file to create a wallet application in the browser (no Web3 or ethUtil required)
* Encrypt and decrypt Geth JSON wallets and decrypt crowdsale wallets
* Build and sign transactions
* Uses meta-classes to create JavaScript objects from any Solidity ABI (encodes and decodes EVM messages)
* Connect to the Ethereum network (via RPC, any existing Web3 objects/providers (including injected Metamask) or [etherscan](https://etherscan.io/))
* Support checksum and ICAP addresses
* Extensive test cases (which has identified and helped fix serious bugs in several other major libraries)
* ~100KB size compressed (~300KB uncompressed)
* MIT license

To do:

* Event polling needs some TLC


The library: [ethers-wallet on github](https://github.com/ethers-io/ethers-wallet/tree/master)

Simple Demo Page: [Wallet demo](https://ethers-io.github.io/ethers-wallet/examples/wallet/)


Please try it out and let me know if you have any problems. File any bugs in the GitHub issues and I'll get to them as soon as possible.",55.0,2016-08-08 19:02:45,0.95
Dapp-a-day 1: ERC20,"Dapp-a-day 1: ERC20
===

*Each weekday leading up to devcon2, Nexus will highlight a dapp, library, or package (something with a `dappfile`) as a promotion of our toolchain and as case studies for other developers.*


Today's dapp, `erc20`, contains the `ERC20` type definition, a single-contract `ERC20Base` implementation, and a factory for the base.

https://github.com/nexusdev/erc20

An instance constructed from the factory is not going to be very useful. The base meant to be extended with extra functionality (issuance, whitelists, etc).

Maybe the most interesting lesson from this package is how the factory must `transfer` tokens to the sender in order for `createERC20Base` to give the ""creator"" the initial balance, as if they constructed it directly. We will see this pattern most of the time there is a `msg.sender` in a constructor.

For tokens that can be migrated or upgraded in-place, watch out for a post on `ds-tokens`, formerly part of the `dappsys` package.

Cryptoshares are reality now!,"CoinOffering Ltd. ( https://coinoffering.com ) is the first company in the world, which shares are represented by tokens issued in the smart contract deployed on the Ethereum blockchain. It is written in the Bylaws of the corporation registered by the state authorities  of the Republic of the Marshall Islands.

According to the Bylaws, voting of the shareholders should be made in the smart contract, and dividents to be payid to shareholders Ethereum accounts.

Code of the smart contract as well as Bylaws of the company are open sourced and published on github: https://github.com/CoinOffering  Deployed code can be verified on etherscan: https://etherscan.io/address/0x684282178b1d61164febcf9609ca195bef9a33b5#code 

This was made possible by the work of international team of experienced lawyers and programmers. CEO and CTO of CoinOffering Ivan Starinin and Alexander Salnikov previously were key players in the team  which made one of the fastest cryptocurrency exchange ‘Margin Call’

CoinOffering uses advanced system for internationally recognizible digital signatures (https://cryptonomica.net). Ethereum acounts owners can be verified via Cryptonomica.net system: https://github.com/Cryptonomica/Ethereum-IdentityProof 
In the by-laws it is stated that all the possible corporate disputes should be resolved in online arbitration court of International Arbitration and Cryptography Centre ( https://github.com/Cryptonomica/arbitration-rules ) in London U.K. using ‘ex aequo et bono’ principle. Thus despite of tax free status from the point of corporate law company “lives” in U.K.

In contrast to ""the Dao"" and similar projects, CoinOffering is a legal entity that can legally conclude deals and own property, and has advanced legal mechanisms to resolve conflicts and disputes.

CoinOffering is developing the first market space for cryptoshares of blockchain-based companies, and for other legal blockchain secured assets, and offers for clients services for creating blockchain-based corporation by the same model it uses itself, but customized for special business needs of the customer. It’s like IPO but better.

CoinOffering is planning to make ICO using cryptoshares on its own web-platform in September 2016.",32.0,2016-08-08 18:06:52,0.92
I'm seeing a considerable amount of users on my DAPPs that seem to be unaware of the concept of gas - any suggestions on how to handle this?,"For example [Ethereum Lottery](https://ethereumlottery.io/): There is a steady stream of users that attempt to buy tickets, but leave the default gas value at 21,000 which is not enough for the smart contract. See the failed transactions here: https://etherscan.io/address/0x302fE87B56330BE266599FAB2A54747299B5aC5B .

So far I only have a note on the website (""Allow for 1,000,000 gas or more."") and was hoping that most users would by now be familiar with the idea, that Ethereum is a smart contract system and that contracts require gas. But I'm guessing there are many wallets out there, which don't make that very clear?

One idea I'm considering: Watch for failed transactions and when there is a new one push a pop-up to all current visitors of the website with a message like: ""Does address 0xabcd...1234 belong to you? The transaction failed because it ran out of gas - learn more about gas HERE."" I haven't implemented that yet though.

Why The Ethereum Ecosystem Will Lead to Rapid Commoditization,"A commodity is a product that was originally created as a custom solution. Then, as people learned more about it, they started to realize that they could turn that custom solution into a product that many people could use and pay them for. When people learned even more, they finally found a way to make it a common component that everyone else could use. 

Commoditization can be seen in the rise of electricity as a service. You can also see it happening right now in what AWS is doing with the cloud -trying to learn how to commoditize different server components. 

The reason this commoditization happens is that creators begin to learn how users are interacting with the products, what they're paying for, and which parts can be completely standardized. They then turn these standardized parts into a cheap component that can be charged per use.

What the blockchain does is create a veritable mountain of data about what people are using and paying for available on the blockchain, so EVERY company in the space is contributing to the understanding of the ecosystem as a whole.  

Additionally, there are four other aspects of Ethereum smart contracts in particular that make them suited for rapid commoditization. 

Firstly, smart contracts by default have their bytecode and data available to everyone. This openness makes it easy to clone contracts, which in turn raises the level of competition, and drives down the price as close to the margin as it can go. It turns out that marginal pricing is the first requirement of a commodify.

Secondly, each contract by default allows every other contract to use all it's functions and view all it's data.  This means that every contract by default is set up to connect with every other contract. This inherent ability to connect is the second requirement of commodities.

Thirdly, by default contracts are immutable.  This unchanging nature means that you can be 100% sure that a contracts interface won't change on you if you build on top of it.  This also happens to be third requirement of a commodity.

Finally, Ethereum smart contracts, due to being tied in with Ether, all come with a built in way to charge users. Because this ability to charge users is so central to the Solidity language, it allows contracts to be incredibly fine grained and charge only for what the users are actually using within the contract. This ability to charge users for only what they're using happens to be the final requirement for a commodity.

As a result, you're going to see the entire ecosystem quickly taking any new innovations that consumers like and standardizing them into api contracts that charge per-use. In short, rapid commoditization.",49.0,2016-08-07 22:25:00,0.89

https://i.imgur.com/SYrDRrD.jpg

In exchange for showing tremendous initiative and finally firetruck-proofing the Maker project, I officially burden these developers with the Maker Lead Developer title.

Now on to a serious topic

Maker doesn't really have voting
===

Let me write my goal with respect to Maker as established when I started my personal stablecoin quest starting in late 2013 and reinforced when I quit my job to work help start the Maker project a little over a year ago.

My goal is to find a stablecoin system design that works ""good enough"" and then make changing the rules as hard as possible. The litmus test is whether adversarial governments ever use it to cooperate (deliberately or not).

""Smart contracts"" should be called ""dumb, durable software objects"". I believe there could be an incentive compatible ""contract"" (dumb persistent software object) system that can create a token whose market price has low volatility relative to a reference asset/basket at scale. This is only possible because it eliminates some kind of deadweight loss, otherwise it can't ""pay for itself"" and survive. Think about how much bitcoin's POW costs. Bitcoin is somehow causing an effective net savings to the economy worth at least that much, or it would shrink and/or die from the massive recurring expense.

Maker is not intended to be a dynamic, intelligent system (e.g. a company offering a software service). It is a dumb mechanism that is a financial tool. In a vacuum it should be instantly out-competed because companies are made out of smart monkeys and not dumb software objects. Because of the fact that the stablecoin niche will likely be occupied by a natural monopoly, and *provable* ""self-restraint"" is the competitive factor, it can likely ""compete"" anyway, the analogy again being how Bitcoin magically isn't worth nothing.

Death is inevitable and obsolecense is the best way to go.

If the current MKR stakeholders do not view Maker this way, that making 100% of the business logic *actually autonomous in reality* is possible and desirable, my advice would be to delete the ""undistributed"" MKR and fund all operations with inflation-by-vote. That is where it would end up anyway, and this is more honest than claiming its supply changes are purely mechanical. Right now it takes 4 of 6 monkeys to agree (or get pwned) to make it whatever they want - everything else is a fragile shared illusion.

I will be formally proposing breaking the supply rules to enable vote-inflation (with the intent of having it *NOT* pass) to be simulated as a proper stake-vote to appease anyone feeling disenfranchised.

Going forward Maker users will inevitably face application-level ""hard fork"" dilemmas. If Maker is successful in any sense of the word then you can be sure any split will be brutal. Again, in the success scenario this coordination problem should work *in favor* of stability since 1) there is a dumb mechanism figured out that works ""good enough"" and 2) it is very convincing that at least *this* mechanism is not going to change: you can safely play long-term iterated games.

I am afraid that Maker could be overrun by stakeholders who vote in a way that will cause it to fail to bootstrap and will just turn into a thin veil around a traditional centralized institution. There is a certain existential risk in running any sort of ""beta"" where recapturing control is possible and where stakeholders are voting on how to spend each other's money.

Fortunately Dictator Rune was wise enough not to do a crowdsale and so that risk may not be high.

Even so, it is clear we need stronger ""convergence intent signals"" as there has been a kind of ""culture creep"" in what I think is the wrong direction.

I have two to offer.

The first is zandy's Sentinel stake-vote blog post, which establishes intent to end up in a voting system that ""locks up"" when MKR is actively traded as an investment asset but nobody can coordinate system-level updates.

The second is the introduction of Kelvin versioning for Maker system updates. In this system you use nonnegative integer versions and count down. The current system is officially version 957. The more versions you (carefully, strategically) choose to skip in an a successful update, the more champagne you can have. Version 0 should have redundant formal verification and users enjoying third-party insurance options - if it's still somehow killed, it's dead. Some version in between will have ""peak monkey organization"". There's always someone who will be better off in the short term if the system doesn't lock down. If the system is efficient, it should often be a slight majority of its users.

This post will not stop some group of future monkeys poking at keyboards from saying ""Maker is now this instead of that"" - we've done it once and everyone went with it (yes I am talking about a maker app fork, not the ethereum fork), who am I to tell future monkey leaders they can't just try to coordinate a migration? One major lesson of the TheDAO disaster is that arguing on the internet is a huge waste of time, so I remind future monkeys finding themselves genuinely unsure about which Maker fork to go with that life is short and cashing out and taking a vacation is always a good option.

While MKR can't have ""terms"", monkeys can have perceptions about what other monkeys are ""supposed"" to be doing. I hope my personal goals are clear and that they align with a majority of existing MKR holders.

Now back to a more fun topic

""I don't care about Maker, but there are 30 other dapps??""
---

We will be highlighting one dapp, library, or package (a repository with a `dappfile`) each weekday from now until Devcon. The title is clickbait because most are not new, but rather freshly isolated building blocks which are direct or indirect dependencies for Maker and other Nexus clients. If there are any instances (ie something deployed, not pure code) they will be ""public utilities"", contracts with no benefactor except their direct users. By default we deploy to Morden, ETH, and now ETC, but they are chain-agnostic and we encourage creating canonical deployments of singleton dapps on other chains (consensys testnet comes to mind).

Expect turbulence as we will also be making a backwards-incompatible toolchain update and migrating everything mid-way.

Today is Day 0 is not a weekday so you don't get a dapp, but anyone interested should get familiar with `dapple`, which is the tool used to build/link/test/deploy dapple packages.

I want to see trial and errors rather than happy investors in Ethereum.,"I want to see trial and error while seeing a strong revolutionary software network emerge, not a scare-and-don't-touch project because ppl are afraid to lose money.




I got into Ethereum because of Vitaliks vision and his team. Now the price has risen, attention increased and the community has grown, we start to see a flood of supposedly "" experts"" (just ppl with money) who now want to decide where Ethereum should go next ( see ETC who've abandoned everyone else already). I don't like that, just let the ETH team continue working on their vision because it's their vision I've invested in, not the pseudo- experts who are essentialy only caring about their money.


Now I see raised concerns about PoS. It has always been on the roadmap since the beginning you wussies (sorry but not sorry).

If you invested in Ethereum, you have invested in its roadmap. I don't want to see people going like: ""oh but the price is strong now, maybe we just shouldn't change too much"". Ethereum has grown because of the promise of the roadmap. Stick to it, even through the bumpy sections.

If you don't like a bumpy road, sell your ETHs and stop dragging the group down. We are building cool new tech, your personal profits (or financial issues) are totally secondary.",199.0,2016-08-07 03:14:23,0.91
"We should start discussing POS now, or risk losing everything...","Recent events have shown us just how fragile our ecosystem is. ETC currently holds 1/4 of the market cap of ETH, while representing something of far less controversy than another impending scenario - the fork of POS vs POW.

This fork is inevitable. At the time of the difficulty bomb, if POS is ready and released, there will almost certainly be some percentage of the community which backs POW. Consequently, a POW client which eliminates the difficulty bomb will be released, and the community will be split into two. This time, I believe the sides will be more evenly distributed than what we are currently experiencing, as both sides will be a reasonable path to take.

The miners will fight tooth and nail to maintain their POW system, as they are fighting against something that makes their investment in hardware obsolete. Others will fight against POS due to it being an unproven system, which we are relying on to secure a billion-dollar network.

Therefore, it is ESSENTIAL that we have positive and constructive conversations well in advance of this event, to ensure that our community is prepared for the controversy which lies ahead. We must make sure everyone is aware of the event, educated on what both sides represent, and educated on why POS is necessary to move forward with this project.

It is also essential that POS be so extraordinarily advantageous that it is illogical NOT to switch to it. The recent Casper stats released by Vitalik are promising, but we will need more than incremental performance improvement to convince the community to adopt an unproven consensus mechanism. Therefore, I urge everyone who is capable to start contributing to Casper. POS must be essential in the mission to create a ""general-purposed decentralized computation platform""; otherwise it will face enormous resistance. As such, it also must be explained, in layman's terms, to the community, why.

I have no inclination to support one side over another; however, if Vitalik and the Casper team think their solution is a proper one, I am absolutely open to the idea of implementing a new consensus mechanism - the community is the reason I have supported, and will continue to support, this project. I only urge that we start talking now, to be better prepared for this inevitable event.",107.0,2016-08-06 17:42:56,0.84

LLL As A Viable Contract Development Language,"I've implemented a [contract function dispatcher](https://github.com/zigguratt/lll-resurrected) in LLL, influenced heavily by Nick Johnson's Solidity-based dispatcher, [upgradeable.sol](https://gist.github.com/Arachnid/4ca9da48d51e23e5cfe0f0e14dd6318f). Both allow a contract to replace itself with a newer or better version, enabling one to address bugs in implementation.

My LLL dispatcher integrates into the Ethereum infrastructure in the same way Solidity does. For example, functions in my dispatcher can be called from a web3 environment, and these functions emit events in the same way as Solidity. Function modifiers are used similarly to the way they're used in a Solidity contract. One exception is that I can use a modifier on the contract as a whole, refusing access if a flag is set indicating that the contract has been disabled, for example.

I'm writing a series of articles going into great detail about the implementation, demonstrating that LLL can be used as a fully fledged contract development language. For those interested, you can read the [first two articles](http://blog.syrinx.net/the-resurrection-of-lll-part-1/). I'll be adding more articles in the coming weeks.

I'm hoping this starts a discussion on alternative languages for Ethereum contract development, moving us away from a language monoculture. The nice thing is, LLL already exists and is a perfectly capable language, so no additional work is necessary!",27.0,2016-08-04 13:55:39,0.84

We have the tools. We have the technology. We are not restricted by political boundaries or ""clubs for the elite"". Only a short time ago, coordination on this scale would have been impossible. Only a short time ago, people born into families of the ruling parties would have been the only minds able to contribute to ideas such as this. We should not let our primitive instincts and petty insecurities get in the way of advancing the human race to never before seen levels of cooperation, coordination, and progression. In the grand scheme of the universe, we are a currently a speck of dirt in a mountain range of possibility. But I'll be damned if I'm not going to try to make this speck of dirt the best god damn speck of dirt in the god damn universe.

We Colony are 100% on ETH,"[Edit]In response to some of the questions, a why seems appropriate.

I am sympathetic to the ETC cause but I supported the hard fork because for me it represented the best available option to a shitty situation we should have never put ourselves in. It's unfortunate that we had to do it, but I believe we did. I think we've all learned a lot and ETH will be better for it. 

So, a few reasons we're 100% behind ETH:

**Team**

I believe that the Ethereum Foundation and Ethcore are the best teams working on a technology which is far from feature complete. We want to be building on the network supported by /u/vbuterin, Jeff, /u/gavofyork, /u/kaeptnjoda, /u/vladzamfir, /u/AVSA, /u/Bobsummerwill, /u/decypha, /u/nickjohnson, /u/frozeman et al. Talent attracts talent, these teams will only grow stronger as time wears on.

**Investment**

Ethereum still has a long dev roadmap ahead. Unless the ""hacker"" is planning to bankroll ETC dev, it's going to be difficult for the ETC team to engage in anything like the same intensity or quality of development as ETH. People need to be paid to work full time; part time, unpaid efforts (which is what I *assume* ETC is reliant upon) cannot compete with the rate of progress well funded teams like EF & Ethcore can exert.

**Utility**

Hashing power is a red herring as to which is the 'dominant chain'. Miners may be moving there because there is a marginal short term economic benefit, but it's a smash and grab.

What really matters is network effect. As ETH has the support of an overwhelming majority of teams building real dApps, its network effect is much stronger and it's growth is therefore likely to accelerate much faster than ETC.

Ether is not intended as a currency in the same way that Bitcoin is. It's function is entirely to allow dApps to pay for gas. Without dApps with the potential significant scale like Colony, Ownage, Augur et al, there will be little by way of gas being used, so there will little by way of real utility for ETC's coin. Without utility, the market will eventually wither.

**Culture**

Based on the behaviour exhibited on Reddit at least, ETH has the more positive, adaptable and supportive community. Trial and error is a fundamental mechanism for learning and growth. I want to be part of a community which recognises that and does not stifle innovation through fundamentalist dogma, and does not try to make pariahs of those who attempt it.

There are more reasons, but that will do. ",173.0,2016-08-03 22:33:02,0.85

While I was (and still am) an anti-forker, I've decided it's wisest to go with the crowd on this one. My biggest concern with forking was that it set a precedent where further forks could take place later on if and when Ethereum starts to see pressure from governments and other powerful actors. However, as I understand it, Casper will make further forks along the lines of what we did with The DAO impossible. So I'm bearing with the team I originally bet on and giving the project a mulligan here.

Hopefully moving forward we'll see *fully validated* contracts become the norm. Safe development beats quick development hands-down in this space. We *cannot* afford another The DAO. We absolutely must be more conservative going forward.",159.0,2016-08-03 22:17:29,0.84

Bitfinex security Breach - WTF!,"Security breach on Bitfinex

Today we discovered a security breach that requires us to halt all trading on Bitfinex, as well as halt all digital token deposits to and withdrawals from Bitfinex.

We are investigating the breach to determine what happened, but we know that some of our users have had their bitcoins stolen. We are undertaking a review to determine which users have been affected by the breach. While we conduct this initial investigation and secure our environment, bitfinex.com will be taken down and the maintenance page will be left up.

The theft is being reported to — and we are co-operating with — law enforcement.

As we account for individualized customer losses, we may need to settle open margin positions, associated financing, and/or collateral affected by the breach. Any settlements will be at the current market prices as of 18:00 UTC. We are taking this necessary accounting step to normalize account balances with the objective of resuming operations. We will look at various options to address customer losses later in the investigation. While we are halting all operations at this time, we can confirm that the breach was limited to bitcoin wallets; the other digital tokens traded on Bitfinex are unaffected.

We will post updates as and when appropriate on our status page, bitfinex.statuspage.io. We are deeply concerned about this issue and we are committing every resource to try to resolve it. We ask for the community’s patience as we unravel the causes and consequences of this breach.

A Mist compatible Forum DApp,"[otlw-forum](https://github.com/otlw/forum) a simple but powerful forum smart-contract application which is accessible through the Mist DApp browser. You can find the frontend source code [here](https://github.com/otlw/forum) and the smart-contracts [here](https://github.com/otlw/publish).

Our document contract is pretty damn flexible and can be used to manage citations and micropayments, so that when you send a payment to one document its automatically distributed through its sources.

We leverage this to incentivize discussion, where each reply sends a micropayment to its parent, we hope this'll lead to a good standard of discussion while providing a small value to authors of good content.

To access the DApp you have to first be running an [IPFS](https://ipfs.io/) daemon as we use IPFS for content distribution. Its relatively simple to set up, and their getting started guide can be found [here](https://ipfs.io/docs/getting-started/). 

If you're alright with trusting our hosting, you can whitelist our domain in ipfs using this command

    $ ipfs config --json API.HTTPHeaders.Access-Control-Allow-Origin ""[\""http://otlw.co\""]""    

And then simply navigate to [otlw.co/forum](http://otlw.co/forum/) in Mist. 

If you **don't** want to trust us simply clone the repo and navigate to the index.html file within mist. 

Using this DApp you can publish documents, categorize them through tags, and post replies, all in an entirely decentralized manner. 

Try navigating to this [document](http://otlw.co/forum/page.html?query=0x7af8f4e400fcc03bf9485d8f65fa4bce4ce16436) (at 0x7af8f4e400fcc03bf9485d8f65fa4bce4ce16436),  for an example. 

Right now the app is really simple. And looks a *little* bit trashy. We know. 

We're not web designers and this is meant to simply show the potential of smart-contract document relationship management. The app is simple to extend and modify, so if you *are* a web developer feel free to submit a pull request or to fork it and modify at will. If you want to get more deeply involved get in touch.  

**Shameless self plug:** We're a tiny team of two people, both recent high school graduates, and we're entirely self-supported. We're fully commited to the ethereum ecosystem, and to building valuable society scale applications. You can read more about our projects [here](http://otlw.co/). 

We literally used all the ether we had to deploy this contract and publish the first post, so if you're feeling generous our ETH address is: *0x60c4dC9a557f7FF2E89ad791bAc53D42b51EE03*",26.0,2016-08-02 15:24:28,0.76
A note on how the latest Casper PoC accomplishes its fast block times safely,"Many people are wondering how it is the a 3 second block time can possibly be safe, especially in a context where (i) we are also interested in pushing up our blockchain's tx/sec rate, and (ii) the network latency of the internet is a large fraction of 3 seconds already. This is for good reason; my [previous article on block times](https://blog.ethereum.org/2014/07/11/toward-a-12-second-block-time/) suggested that 12 seconds was safe but not much less. And yet, [this happened](https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin/status/760185856057638913). In fact, it turns out that the latency was understated: the above 1% stale rate held true even though the average network latency was 2.2 seconds rather than 1.25 seconds (essentially, I set the per-hop latency, but on average nodes in that simulation were ~1.8 hops away) So, what has changed?

The answer is simple: proof of stake. In proof of work, block creation is what is called a Poisson process - an event that has some very small fixed chance of taking place every millisecond. In a Poisson process with a mean block time of 14.3 seconds, once a block is created there is a 6.75% chance that a block will be created in the next second, a 13.05% chance that a block will be created in the next two seconds, etc. This means that, with a mean network latency of ~0.8 seconds (Ethereum's [approximate average](http://ethstats.net)), once a block is created there is a ~5.44% chance that another block will be created before that block's miner hears about the first new block, leading to the current stale/uncle rate.

Casper is NOT a poisson process. Rather, the way it works is that every block creates a random seed from which we generate a sequence of child validators, where after the first 3 seconds the first validator can generate a block, then the second, etc. This has the benefit that as long as everything can happen within the 3-second window, there should be no problems - a latency of 2.2s should not affect the system at all, though a latency of 4s would be very harmful, though not worse than a latency of 4s would be with a 3-second mean block time PoW.

But we can go further - the above simulation results in fact hold true for network latencies even going all the way up to ~6 seconds (ie. 3.5 seconds per hop). What did we do there? The answer is another clever trick: the time for the primary child of a block to appear with no skips is set to 3 seconds, but the time _between_ skips (ie. the difference between the appearance time of the first and second validator, the second and third, etc) is 6 seconds. So the second validator has to wait 9 seconds to make a block. Fortunately, we can expect bonded validators to be online most of the time, and most of the time the 3-second mark is when blocks get created, but the safety margin we have for network latency is based on the time it takes to get to the second validator. This means that, if more safety is deemed desirable, we may even want to adopt a 3/12 formula (ie. first validator after 3s, second after 15s, etc) to double the network latency tolerance with low decreases in average block time.

Next steps for us: transform the network simulator code into an actual test network running on top of pyethapp.",419.0,2016-08-02 13:03:53,0.78
Golem network token (GNT) sale: this September!,"With our announced DAO plans no longer being possible, we have decided to launch a token sale for the Golem network.
Golem enables users to buy and sell unused computing resources. This compute time can be used to process virtually any computationally-demanding task, creating the first global market for idle computing power. Golem is a decentralized, P2P network utilizing Ethereum and smart contracts as the backbone for all transactions. A fee of 5% is imposed on every transaction, to finance development and upkeep of the network. In turn, the revenue stream affords us the ability to further incentivise purchasers: our intention is to share fee revenues from the Golem network.

**GOLEM NETWORK TOKEN (GNT)**

GNT is an Ethereum-based token, which will be used for all transactions in the Golem network. The integration of the transaction system with fee and token reward mechanics will be relatively simple: rewards will be built on top of the token in a manner which ensures the security of the token and transaction fees. We believe that the design of GNT maximises our chances success by aligning the incentives of both GNT owners and Golem’s developers, while at the same time minimizing security issues for both the GNT holders and the Golem network at large.

**HOW GNT WILL WORK**

All transactions in the Golem network will be subject to a fee, approximately 5% of the transaction value. This will include both transactions between the users – payments for computing power – and transactions between users and software developers. The latter will consist of payments for the software used on the Golem network in a SaaS model. Where applicable, a blend of both open source and proprietary software will be used.
It is important to note that GNT will NOT be used for payments within the Golem network: Its only role is to grant the owner a share in the Golem network’s fee revenue.

**TOKEN SALE DETAILS**

Minimum financing: 100K ETH, maximum financing (cap): 650k ETH.
Note: We reserve the right to change the minimum/max financing anytime before the sale begins, pending sudden and significant ETH price movements.

A percentage of the tokens will be held back for founders, developers, and the operating company, an incentivizing endowment for further development and innovation. We define this endowment as 18% of all tokens (specifically, 6% to Golem’s founders, 12% to the operating company).

At the opening of the sale, tokens are created for every ETH sent to us, up to the cap. At the close of the sale period, we will generate tokens for both the developers and the company (only at such a point are we are able to determine how much we need to reach 18%). This is the total pool of tokens, representing entitlement to 100% of the Golem network’s fee revenue. There will be no technical possibility to create any new tokens at this point.

**THIS IS NOT A DAO**

The Golem Network Token does not grant its holders any voting rights or direct influence on the project’s development. The positive economic outcome for the owners is ensured by aligned incentives. In the future, Golem may evolve into a contract-driven organisation governed by GNT votes, but during the first stage, it is very much more traditional.

**TIMELINE**

* Semi-public Alpha: TODAY! Join our [slack](http://golemproject.org:3000/) to participate, or read the instructions [here](https://github.com/imapp-pl/golem-docs/blob/master/Installation.md)

* Brass Golem public alpha, and opening of repository: 2nd half of August, 2016

* GNT sale locked details announcement: End of August, 2016

* Whitepaper: September, 2016

* GNT sale opens: September, 2016

**CLOSING REMARKS**

Golem is software designed to enhance and optimize the way we use infrastructure. By building a platform which joins efforts across a number of specializations (blockchain, compute, image processing, and more), we clearly aim to integrate use cases and projects, giving Ethereum and related technologies a wider audience that is dependent on its core functionality. We have high hopes that we will be able to facilitate such an effort, while at the same time assisting other teams in their work to apply this new approach to many new fields.

"Good news for ETH holders: about 50% of ETC Price rise is from people selling bitcoins, not ETH","On July 31, 11pm EST, the market cap of ETH was approx $975m and market cap of ETC was approx $150m.  Overnight there was a rise in ETC price and market cap, but the decline in ETH market cap  only accounted for about 50% of this rise:  e.g currently at 1045AM EST on Aug 1, ETH market cap is $957m (a decline of about $16.5m) while ETC market cap has risen to $181m (an increase of about $32m).  Almost all of this difference is made up of people selling bitcoin to buy ETC (and thus the 24-hour volume of ETC is also about $15m higher than ETH).

Why is this good news for ETH holders?  Two main reasons:

1) ETC is not rising solely at the expense of ETH, it needs to attract new investment from bitcoin.  It is a not a zero sum game.  And even if ETC keeps rising, it does not mean that ETH needs to fail.  They both could be large secure chains catering to different user groups. 

2) As long as ETH holders do not panic sell their ETH to buy ETC, further rises in ETC price to make it on parity with ETH will be extremely expensive and require mass dumping of bitcoin, which is unlikely to be sustainable since bitcoiners will eventually see that they are hurting BTC more than they are hurting ETH by fueling the rise of ETC.

"Again, Don't Worry - ETC Is a Pump and Dump.","I thought I'd leave a quick comment to quell the fears of people who may not be involved in the Ethereum community as much as others, and/or those who may not have the time or will to track things as closely as others, especially since there are many people expressing their concerns on this sub.

ETC is a pump and dump. We all know it. The people pumping it know it. The miners know it. It's a quick and easy way to make a buck. I've watched the same thing happen to 1000's of alt coins, and watched the same thing happen when I used to trade penny stocks before that.

If you want evidence, you can watch the Poloniex troll box, and draw a parallel to this sub (almost as much trolling going on here as there is in there right now). When a big dump happens, everyone who was previously spreading the ""ETC hype"", says ""LOL THERE IT GOES"" and dumps their coins. They then drop the price, buy back in, and prey on the FOMO of who are ill-informed by shouting things like ""ETC skyrocketing, ETH is broken!"", pumping it back up for another dump.

FOMO is easy to succumb to; however, once you have an informed view of the situation, it becomes easier to resist. The informed view of the subject is this - anyone who is anyone in the Ethereum developer space is moving forward with the ETH chain. ETC has next to 0 true support, except from these 'traders' (a term which I use, in this case, very generously).

I'm writing this because I don't want to see innocent people lose their money. If you want to ride the wave and try to buy low and sell high, go for it. It's fun and exciting and is making a lot of people a lot of money. But please, don't buy and hold thinking that ETC will be adopted; you'll merely be giving your money to the people who have tricked you.

Apologies if this has offended any radical ETC believers - I'm sure there are some of you out there who truly believe in the chain, but I can assure you, these people are very, very few and far between, despite how it may seem on the Reddit airwaves.

Best of luck to everyone in these crazy times!",87.0,2016-08-01 06:34:40,0.64

My concerns right now with current events,"Firstly, this might be a rehash, but I feel like it needs to be said. 

To keep it simple, I do not want to have to monitor my investment every day. I want to be able to take off for 6 months, and know I have nothing to worry about.

My concern is that the ETC'ers will try to use aggressive tactics to try to force Ethereum developers to support them, as we've already seen them try to do with threats of lawsuits and what not, which I believe are unfounded and fear tactics.

As an investor, I want to clearly know the developers position. If the developers do back ETH, I want to know the developers are 100% behind Ethereum, the main ETH chain. I don't like making lousy investments or wasting money (unnecessarily holding ETC, for which historically we've seen thousands of copy-cat coins fail, down to nearly $0 value), It's far easier for to know where the development team stands, and invest accordingly, if I need to, I will buy ETC to hedge, I'd really rather not though, I'm not a fan of their community, I don't like the rhetoric I hear from there, it would feel like a very dirty icky purchase to me, and money is energy, I firmly believe you should invest in what you believe in (thus I hope the ETH foundation keeps the high standard of morals I have seen from that for so long and keeps our communities trust).

To add, as long as the ETH chain is held up as the primary chain, I would not mind to see ETC do well, if anything I think that could help the Ethereum ecosystem, what I fear is that they wouldn't have the same level of compassion toward us (as I am seeing through their words and actions), and may be far more aggressive toward us, than we have been to them.

In personal disclosure, regarding the DAO, I did invest in the DAO, but I sold my DAO tokens early on, thus the hard fork did not benefit me. I favored it because it was morally right, I want to make sure these moralities are held in tact by the Ethereum developers, (which I do strongly believe they are), or if needed I can simply diversify now.

One question that I feel needs transparency here, is, does the ETH foundation still hold ETC or did it liquidate it? This will help me plan accordingly.

One risk too is that Ethereum developers might see some kind of tie to ETC because it was the old chain. I think the correct perspective is as Vitalik mentioned a few days ago- seeing it as a spin-off chain, something unsupported, the same as the thousands of Bitcoin clones. I would imagine that it needs to be seen as a completely separate entity and to preserve a clear distinction. This is the confusion in the market place too. ETC investors are betting this is not the case, ETH investors are. 

I'm trying to be far-sighted, and give a warning to prevent this type of event from coming to a boiling point, that is all. There is a lot of money, almost $200M that is being speculated against the uncertainly ot the position of the Ethereum Foundation and developers, please see that.

Finally, I think it is in the foundations best interest to make a clear stance on this, as it was intended. I know you made one post Vitalik, but something to make it crystal clear. It would probably be worth consulting with your counsel as well, but I imagine this is the cleanest move by far (rather than leave any ambiguity for your core investors).

In closing, I want to say, I'm just voicing the concerns of the investors, again none of us saw this coming, but these are the challenges that we must overcome, and the sooner we tackle these obstacles, the sooner we can move on and focus on what we should be- the technological development and the bright times ahead in the blockchain world.

With respect and love,

How I learned to stop Worrying and Love the Wild West,"At a much higher level than any of the immediate drama is the question of how do I and/or we cope with decisions by others that we do not agree with. This is the essence of anarchy, where (let's face it) we have all chosen to dwell. Whether the issue is if you think the block size should be raised, or if a hacker should get away with a massive heist on a poorly written contract, or if a hard fork is justified to stop it, or if two chains should exist in the aftermath, or if a pool should present a 51-attack on another chain, or if reddit-censorship is good, or if DDOS-ing is justified to stop that pool, the fact that there really is no central force for ruling one way (to the exclusion of the other) is the essence of decentralization. This is the beast we created, and I wouldn't have it any other way.

Sides will form and emotions will boil over, and actions will be taken that some of us do not think help the community. That is fine. We are still here (albeit segmented) because we believe what we have already built is strong enough to warrant continued attention. After watching the passion and creativity of the crypto community, I am convinced that even if this particular project fails, a blockchain 3.0 (if you will) will rise from the ashes that is even stronger and more useful than ethereum with benefits we could not even dream of under the current paradigm. Failure is not only not an option, it is not even within the realm of possibilities. I only urge everyone to remain as civil as possible even as we watch others overreact, and not be discouraged from focusing on dAPPS, programs, regulations, PR, use cases and building other concepts that will strengthen crypto's value proposition and grow the community as a whole. The rest, I am sure, will work itself out. ",90.0,2016-07-31 19:30:05,0.9

"(serious) We should start our own independent nation, we have the capital.","At this point I think the crypto community has matured greatly and we can have some real sway in the world, but we are still being prosecuted by overbearing governments for no reason.
With the capital we now command we are able to secede from our governments and start our own nation.

We could start with one island such as this for example: http://www.privateislandsonline.com/islands/isla-verdugo 
*note this is just an example

5400 acres for $2.2 million. I know a lot of people will say that you can't just buy some land from a country and be an independent nation but here's the thing. Look at how bureaucratic and backwards some governments are if we raised around the approximate amount the dao raised I'm sure a lot of countries would allow us to break off and become an independent nation.
Once we are an independent nation we would become a hub for not just crypto enthusiast but entrepreneurs and start ups everywhere.

I know many people have been dreaming of something like this becoming a reality, what I'm trying to get across is this doesn't have to be a dream anymore we have the power to make it a reality.

Ethereum 1 year old today. Happy Birthday!!,"Ethereum has achieved so much in the last 12 month and im looking forward to this speeding up over the next 12 months.

So much has been achieved.

Apart from these 671 there are 246 more projects that are building on top of Ethereum http://dapps.ethercasts.com/ and plenty more which are still in Stealth mode we dont even know about.
None of the 671 projects are inter-operable with each other (can speak to each other) but the 243+ project on Ethereum are  inter-operable with each other and i think this is the big thing that set Ethereum apart from the rest and the future looks bright IMO. Ethereum started in 2014 with 40+ developers and moved into the 100's in 2015 and this year there are 1000's of Developers working on Ethereum Ecosystem.

"Well, I just got burned by coinbase and the splitter contract.","**Resolved successfully , see the post from Michael-Coinbase***

First time I've lost funds the last few years. I had some ETH in one of my mist wallets, and sent it through the splitter mentioned in Vitalik's post. (https://blog.ethereum.org/2016/07/26/onward_from_the_hard_fork/).  I set it to send the ETH to my Coinbase wallet, and the ETC to Poloniex.  Executed the contract and it all went well.  Blockchain verified that my ETH was sent and confirmed to my Coinbase ETH wallet address, and that my ETC was sent and confirmed to my Poloniex address.  Nice, no issues and it worked fine.  Login to Poloniex, and my ETC is there. Login to Coinbase.. and nothing is there. Wait a few hours. Nothing. I now have hundreds of confirms on my Coinbase wallet address that it's there, and it's ETH and on the correct fork. Triple verified I had the correct Coinbase wallet address.. yup.. it's correct. Open a support ticket. No response for three days but I did finally get a response from Rosie at Coinbase: ""Unfortunately, Coinbase and GDAX is not able to support transactions sent to or from Ethereum contract addresses, and we are unable to recover Ether or other tokens deposited to your Coinbase or GDAX account in this way""  Basically, even though it clearly shows my ETH at my coinbase wallet address on the blockchain, Coinbase is refusing to recognize it because it was sent from a contract (the splitter). As far as I know no other exchange has this restriction (Poloneix had no issues with the ETC from the contract) , and I see nothing or any warnings from Coinbase that if it involves a contract they will refuse to acknowledge it or even return it - even though it's in your Coinbase wallet address.  Sucks major. So I got burned by them for about 100 eth, with no way for me to get it back even though it's in my Coinbase wallet address.",51.0,2016-07-29 22:34:30,0.76
Introducing BeerCoin,"At long last, I'm pleased to present BeerCoin, a new token contract that can be found on the blockchain at [0x74c1e4b8cae59269ec1d85d3d4f324396048f4ac](https://etherscan.io/address/0x74c1e4b8cae59269ec1d85d3d4f324396048f4ac).

BeerCoin is a new cryptocurrency intended to encapsulate and record the concept of ""I owe you a beer"". Did someone answer a difficult question you had? Send them a BeerCoin. Did they help you carry something heavy? Send them a BeerCoin. Someone buy you a beer? Send them a BeerCoin.

Unlike traditional currency, anyone can issue BeerCoin simply by sending it to someone else. A person's BeerCoin is only as valuable as the recipient's belief that they're good for the beer, should it ever be redeemed; a beer owed to you by Vitalik Buterin is probably worth more than a beer owed to you by the DAO hacker (but your opinions may differ on that point).

BeerCoin is implemented as an ERC20 compatible token, with a few extensions. Regular ERC20 transfers will create or resolve obligations between the two parties; they will never transfer third-party BeerCoins. Additional methods are provided to allow you transfer beers someone owes you to a third party; if Satoshi Nakamoto owes you a beer, you can transfer that obligation to your friend who just bought you one down at the pub. Methods are also provided for determining the total number of beers a person owes, to help determine if they're good for it, and for getting a list of accounts that owe someone a beer.

BeerCoin may confuse some wallets, such as Mist, that expect you can only send currency up to your current total balance; since BeerCoin operates as individual IOUs, that restriction doesn't apply. As a result, you will sometimes need to call the 'transfer' function on the contract itself instead of using the wallet's built in token support.

# Sending someone a Beercoin

If you have at least as many BeerCoin owing to you as you wish to send, you can simply use Mist's wallet interface to send them. If the person you're sending to owes you beer, those beers will be 'redeemed' before any IOUs are created on your behalf; two people can't simultaneously owe each other a beer.

Otherwise, click on 'Contracts', then the Beercoin contract. From the dropdown list of functions choose 'Transfer', and enter the recipient's address and the number of beers you wish to send into the boxes before clicking OK and sending the transaction.

# Setting your beer credit limit

By default, people can only owe you at most one beer. If you'd like to allow people to owe you more than one beer, click on the Contract in the mist wallet, then from the dropdown list of functions select 'Set Maximum Credit', and enter the number of beers' worth of credit you're prepared to extend people.

# Rewards and bounties

If anyone finds a bug in the contract, I'll buy you a beer. If you find a bug you can exploit to adjust balances without users' consent, I'll buy you two (or more).

If you feel obliged to me for creating this, send me a beer at 0x5fC8A61e097c118cE43D200b3c4dcf726Cf783a9. Don't do it unless you mean it; if we meet I'll surely redeem it.

# DApps and UIs

If anyone's interested in writing a DApp or UI, I have a few thoughts on how it could work that I'd be happy to share. It's pretty important that it work on phones, since that's all you're likely to have down at the pub.

And, of course, if you build a UI, I'll buy you a beer.",209.0,2016-07-29 17:15:55,0.91
The___Games___on___Ethereum,"Every day game servers have to follow lots of routines, suffer lots of attacks, go through heavy bandwidth storms, sometimes they even have to bear DDoS and what not. And talk about gamers - they have the worst nightmares than any other living being in this world.

To rescue the game servers, to save the gamers from everyday frustrations, to release the full potential of game players here comes **The_Games** !!!

I and my friend *Brother Krishna* have been working on a project which got scraped today. But as I have spent my past 10 months thinking about it, dreaming about it, I will continue this project myself. Ideas, dreams I and my friend had came up with are priceless. In this post I will explain our ideas and let the community know about this project.

* What is this project ?
    * *The_Games* is a game platform on Ethereum blockchain.
* How to use this software ?
    * Platform application is installed in a computer. Platform installation includes ethereum client installation with required dependencies. User needs to create an account on our application which is basically an Ethereum account.
* How this software works ?
    * This application provides restfulJSON API to games. Games ask for information via API to this platform. This platform reaches to Ethereum blockchain, read or write require data. Send back response to games.
* What are the features of this platform ?
    * Ethereum has created a technology where people can interact with each other in a cryptographically secured peer to peer fashion. **The_Games** platform replaces traditional *server - client* model with *blockchain* and *peer to peer* technology. This platform will adopt all the advantages that web3 will obtain over server-client model .
    * Our blockchain model is capable to identify ingame items, so individual items can be represented in some form of ethereum contract and sold. These items can be monetized as the game developers want. This concept creates two things -
        * 1 - A marketplace for game developers and game mod developers.
        * 2 - A marketplace for game players. Till now money was flowing from gamers to game developers mainly. Now money in gaming world will flow all the way around gamer, game developers and game players. Now every game player on the earth can play games and sell their game items achieved by playing games, in the market and make some cash.
    * Autonomous contracts can handle game purchases and send shares between game developers, investors and sellers.

**VISIONS**

A gamer lives in a game. It is his/her home. A game character should be like its living in that game. When I came to know about Ethereum project and found out its abilities I realized it is possible to create a this in Ethereum network. With solidity we can create such rules.

Whisper a messaging protocol, enables peer to peer messaging no need to go to servers then come back to my network and reach my friend who is sitting right beside me and playing against me.

Swarm can deliver files you need in millisecond.
>Oh I forgot to mention if you store files for me u will get incentive.

Your wallet is your bank - You tell when to renew your game, you control when you pay to buy a game.

You can sit and play and forget about any cheating issue. Our platform verifies every player who is playing and messages sent/received are verified by everyone so don't worry, the other one is not cheating.


What I mentioned is just a glance of awesome features ethereum made available to us and we want to make them available to the gaming world. We imagine this is a portal between Ethereum Blockchain and Gaming. We have all our thoughts, visions documented. We have some basic implementation also. Now we are working on its messaging protocol. We give our ideas to community. Now the community decides future of *The_Games*.

We need investors and contributors to go forward with this project. I am expecting help from reddit community and ethereum community. Please guys help us build it.

Jaxx will not be supporting ETC in the Near Future,"Too much other development plans in the works short-term. We do, however, reserve the right to re-evaluate implementation at a later time.",172.0,2016-07-28 18:16:47,0.83
"MyEtherWallet, Preventing Replays, and Ethereum Classic (ETC)","The second most requested featured for MyEtherWallet has only come up in the past 3 days: supporting ETC. We have stated publicly, numerous times, that we will not be supporting ETC. As a free open-source project, we unfortunately do not have unlimited time or resources to build out every feature. We would rather build features that we know will be truly useful to the community in a month and six months and a year for now. We would like to build a foundation for an epic, free, open-source service that benefits all of you.

On a personal level, we **did not want to push this feature.** We do not support that chain. We do not support what it stands for. And we do not agree with the decision Poloniex made to support ETC, which caused everyone else to follow suit. It is a obvious money grab by a greedy exchange and it gives the attacker funds that should be worthless. It has caused unnecessary confusion, unnecessary stress, and unnecessarily further fractures this once beautiful community.

Unfortunately, not supporting ETC means that regular, well-intentioned ETH holders put themselves in danger due to replay attacks. People need to be able to easily just ETH or just ETC and they should be able to do so without syncing two separate chains on Mist.

So, we have a compromise of sorts. Or a lazy solution. Whatever you want to call it. This enables you to easily send just ETH or just ETC to another place of your choosing (like Kraken where you can promptly dump it or whatever you want). Then you can safely use default transaction once the balance of your account on the ETC chain is 0.

##On the send transaction tab you now have 3 choices on how to send ETH:

1. ETH (Standard Transaction): This generates a default transaction directly from one address to another. It has a default gas of 21000. It is likely that any ETH sent via this method will be replayed onto the ETC chain.

2. Only ETH: This sends via [Timon Rapp's replay protection contract (as recommended by VB)](https://blog.ethereum.org/2016/07/26/onward_from_the_hard_fork/) so that you only send on the ETH chain.

3. Only ETC: This sends via [Timon Rapp's replay protection contract (as recommended by VB)](https://blog.ethereum.org/2016/07/26/onward_from_the_hard_fork/) so that you only send on the ETC chain.

We are NOT displaying ETC balances but we are linking to gastracker.io where you can see the balance of your account in ETC. Keep in mind that gastracker.io is basically where etherchain / etherscan were almost a year ago in term of development. You cannot see gas. You cannot see why a transaction failed. It spazzes out on displaying transactions to and from contracts at times. So be patient and do not rely too heavily on it to verify things, especially transactions to and from contracts.

I love you all, but we want to get back to developing real features (and eating Swiss cheese and chocolates). [You can read about our future here](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/4v0r32/myetherwallet_now_supports_sending_any_ethereum/). 

If you have conceptual questions about how the ETC / ETH chains work, feel free to ask in this thread. I see so much confusion and I, hopefully along with others in this thread, will do my best to educate and help you understand WTF is going on in this crazy multiverse, minus the opinions and rhetoric. 

Please do your best to not bother us with ETC feature requests, though. Thank you for understanding and we truly appreciate your support. 


**Notes:**

- In order to send ONLY ETC, you must have <.01 ETH in the corresponding address on the ETH chain to cover gas.

- If you are still unable to get the transaction to go thru, try NOT using the ""Send All"". 

- This is due to how the contract is set up. My apologies. Please let us know the address you are sending from (via email if you prefer) if you cannot send so that we can debug further. Thank you!

MyEtherWallet now Supports Sending Any Ethereum Token (ERC-20) — also learn about our future plans,"##Sending Tokens

We at MyEtherWallet just added the single most requested features: Sending any Ethereum token on the network via a super simple GUI. This is now live on MyEtherWallet. Any token that is built on the [ERC-20 spec](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/20) is now supported and — yes — you can add your own super special token.

By default (meaning you don’t have to do anything besides click a single radio button) we currently support viewing the balance and sending of:

- DAO

- DGD

- MKR

- Unicorns

Sending Token Interface: 

https://ipfs.pics/ipfs/QmVkVDGxgesf299gQhXp9kFxVcH8EkEgu81p5T2faenok7

https://ipfs.pics/ipfs/QmXgMsaQrPdjxhJdV5EKCC7PkWxRsh48vw2fk4w7rPGDM9

But, by clicking the “Custom” radio button, you have the ability to add any custom token on the network by inputting the Address of the token, the Token Symbol (what you want it to be referred to as), and the number of decimals. If you have ever added a Watch Token to Mist, these items will be familiar to you.

Adding a Custom Token: https://ipfs.pics/ipfs/QmTRSvUwfzTfzmP6U1iaE82ZWCBWfzuSk8UQfA1gKzAxa1

The real magic happens once you add this custom token. Like Mist, you can now send it to any address and you can also view the balance of the token in the sidebar. However, unlike everything else on MyEtherWallet, the address of the token, token symbol, and decimals will be saved in you local.storage and remain there when you return to MyEtherWallet later. That way, you don’t have to re-add tokens each time.

Custom Token Added: https://ipfs.pics/ipfs/QmZTJauzVLXWWFkZ1mYqvbKrxR8E2KQzeamBbKb8B6Y7VV

We plan on supporting DGX and DAI and REP when they are ready. We are open to adding any other commonly used token as a default so that you don’t have to track down the address / decimals. Just shoot us an email, comment here, or reach out to us on twitter and let us know what tokens you use most.

##Misc

We rearranged and re-named the navigation to make it clearer and more simple. Now you will only Withdraw DAO using the old DAO tab and claim DGD at the old Digix tab. All token transactions will occur on the Send Tokens page.

You can also now view all your token balances on the Send Tokens tab and View Wallet Info tab.

##The Future

As some of you know, /u/kvhnuke and I are in Switzerland right now partying it up. And by partying, I mean coding our brains out with some amazing people here. We have re-examined our goals and the future of MyEtherWallet and come up with the following list of items we want to accomplish.

**Short Term**

- Set up MyEtherWallet to be translated. We have secured volunteers to translate Chinese, French, Korean, and some Russian. Please reach out to us if you have the ability to translate and feel like donating your services to a worthwhile cause. This will make MyEtherWallet significantly easier to use for our international community. A post will be made in the coming days on how you can contribute. We will make it easy.

- Set Up MyEtherWallet to support BTC. You will have one private key to support both ETH & BTC, you can see both balances, will have two addresses, and can send both. As an added bonus, you will be able to exchange one for the other instantly without leaving MyEtherWallet. This is less for hardcore Bitcoin users or Bitcoin users who already have a favorite BTC wallet. Instead, it’s for Ethereum-focused folks who have some BTC they want to occasionally store, spend, or exchange without the need to have two separate wallets.

- Support using a QR code to unlock your wallet from your browser / phone.

- Support exchanging ETH / BTC -> EUR without leaving MyEtherWallet.com

**Medium/Long Term**

- Launch Android and iPhone apps

- Support exchanging ETH / BTC -> CHF without leaving MyEtherWallet.com

- Support exchanging ETH / BTC -> USD without leaving MyEtherWallet.com

- Support exchanging ETH / BTC / Tokens without leaving MyEtherWallet.com

##Ethereum Classic

Will update status shortly and will post separately so the discussion can stay focused on Tokens and The Future in this thread. Please yell at us  on the other thread.

So many conflicting views on the ETC subreddit... That is going to be interesting to watch over the coming weeks,"I was just poking around their subreddit, there are so many conflicting viewpoints-- do they want to follow us, or do they want their own roadmap, do they want to add more features, or stay the same, PoW or PoS?, is Vitalik good, or evil? Lol, and on it goes.

What is really interesting though, is there is no leadership. And even if leaders do arise, I don't think everyone will agree with them - and their whole premise is to not go with what they don't agree with it. 
So what else can happen when there's no leadership in place? Well it could be hijacked, look at Bitcoin right now w/ Bitcoin core and Blockstream.

They were very ambitious, but they didn't think this through... I think them tearing each other  apart will likely be their demise (if something else doesn't do it before then).
That or someone forcibly takes the leadership which doesn't bode very well either I imagine..

My thoughts about freedom and love using the example of ETH Fork.,"First i would like to say that i think most of us missunderstood what happened during the last days with ETH and ETC.
There was no extra money created out of thin air nor was someone scammed.
A big part of the community just decided to do a fork by voting on mining pools and through mining power, to make a DAO bailout. The other part didn't want to go this direction and went on with the original ETH client. There is nothing wrong about that.
So right now there are just two communities which see things different.
As a consequence the marketcap is now divided into two parts and therefore it is neither freemoney nor scam. There are just like two companies out of one now.
Unfortunately this results often in being less value together than before due to the dispute, at least shortterm in my opinion.

Unfortunately i have noticed during the last days a lot of hate and violence against other thinking people all other the Cryptoworld. It reminds me of the Bitcoin blocksize debate. ( Lets just decide the market like here btw :) )

In my opinion something went really wrong here in Cryptoworld.
I think our main purpose of using this new technologies is to create an alternative to the centralistic, corrupt, violent, surpressing minorities institutions so anyone can speak free or let his money and work vote for him.

So the market, the people should decide whatever is right for them. Now in this case, lets say 20% of ETH(prefork) Community , maybe even more(market will show) voted for no bailout and are going strict after code. I think everyone has his different opinion on this but thats not the point. It is a fact, that noone is same. The problem here right now is that a lot of people are discriminating others for having a different opinion in both directions which is really sad.

This reminds me of the brexit voting in June.
Here in Germany all over the media they said that they voted for the wrong side. But what is the wrong side ? Nobody ever knows except „god“. This decision was neither right nor wrong. Its just a fact that 51% of the british people voted for the brexit and 49% against. So why should you argue that 51% of the people are wrong ? Nobody is wrong, it is just different viewpoints and decision making. Both sides are important and the good thing in a free market is that they will find a way to live their lives and ideologies(if they have one) and can go after what they love.

By spreading FUD and hatred and don't take others opinion serious we just harm ourself and the whole cryptocommunity. We are here to change this right? And now end up doing exact this :(

Fortunately the truth will always come out and find a way, here thanks to poloniex who offered at first a way for the people who want to support the original code to do so.
Thereby nothing can be destroyed nor will be anything created out of thin air. It is just the truth which was there anyway and finds auditory now, which is great.

I am not for ETC and there dogmatic way but i am above all not for an ETH community like it develops now, discriminating and surpress other opinions or ways of living and thinking.

For me everyone can create as many coins as he likes. The market will decide which coins will survive and which don't. That won't hurt. It will most likely just bring more people who contribute to a free world where everyone can go after what one loves.

The voluntarily decision of people is the biggest potential we have. Let us focus on love and interacting together respectful and not fight against each other  BTC vs ETH or ETH vs Lisk or ETH vs ETC etc. All have there right to exist, otherwise they wouldn't. Trust the truth, which will happen anyway and follow your heart.

I am for free speech and togetherness so everyone can live and  reveal uniqueness.
The diversity is more than the sum of his parts.
We should not all try to become the same and rather live our whole unique potential. Every human with his own opinion, own lifestyle is powerful.
Everyone has a right to be heard.",24.0,2016-07-27 16:43:55,0.83

Somewhat sad yet poetic: thousands of DAO token swap requests in vain at the Withdrawal contract on the ETC chain,"The difference between the two chains is that in the ETH chain, the hard fork moved the balance from the DAO and its child DAOs to the already created withdrawal contract. *Nothing else*.

So the withdrawal contract at http://etherscan.io/address/0xbf4ed7b27f1d666546e30d74d50d173d20bca754 also exists on the ETC chain - it was created before the fork: http://gastracker.io/addr/0xbf4ed7b27f1d666546e30d74d50d173d20bca754 . It just has no funds, those are still in the child DAOs (and meanwhile grandchild darkDAO).

All DAO token transfers to the withdrawal contract on the ETH chain (to redeem the ETH you invested), are transactions that can be replayed on the ETC chain if there's enough ETC in the sending address (so if the owner has not moved her ETC to a separate address to avoid replay).

So you will see thousands of replayed withdrawal transactions (all in vain, since nothing to withdraw) at the ETC chain: http://gastracker.io/addr/0xbf4ed7b27f1d666546e30d74d50d173d20bca754 - as a kind of zombie mirror world.

Formal Verification For Solidity,"The second iteration of formal verification features for Solidity has been released!

It is now possible to verify re-entrancy effects using invariants!

Listen to a [talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rx0NPckEWGI) about it or just view the [slides](https://chriseth.github.io/notes/talks/formal_ic3_bootcamp/) - the talk includes a live demo that shows how to use the new feature in [browser-solidity](http://ethereum.github.io/browser-solidity).

**What can be done with it:**
Not all of Solidity is supported, you will see error messages if you use unsupported parts of Solidity. Basically, the uint type, arrays of it, arithmetics on it, assignments, while loops, if statements, functions, internal function calls (also recursive) and sending Ether via `.call.value(x)()` is supported.

**What is not supported:**
Function calls to other contracts (apart from sending Ether), the `msg` and `block` variables (receiving ether is not yet modeled), mappings, custom datatypes and datatypes other than uint.

**How are effects of reentrant calls handled?**
Any conditions that are used atop of the contract definition are automatically applied to (and verified for) all functions of the contract. For now, you still have to make sure that these conditions are transitive. This means that a condition of the form ""the balance increases by 1"" is invalid (because two calls will not satisfy the condition) and the system will not yet notice that. In contrast, a condition of the form ""the balance will not decrease"" is valid.

**What are the next steps?**
The next step is to add support for mappings, so that it is possible to formally verify a simple EIP20 token.

Why is people claiming that there are different devs?

Are any devs planning to exclude the option to choose either chain in future client versions and then calling for another whole new repository to be maintained in which the only difference would be a default non-forked option?

As a supporter of both chains, that wouldn't make any sense. Both chains are the product of the same developers.

"Explanation of Replay Attacks...or... ""God, I miss Mr. Sparkles.""","**First, a brief review of how blockchains work:**


Blockchains consist of blocks.  Blocks are created (mined) every so often and added to the blockchain.


Blocks contain transactions.  


Commonly, a transaction sends money from one account to another.  The data required to describe such a transaction includes the senders account, the recipients account, and the amount of money to send.


Such a transaction must be signed by the private key of the sender.  


Once it is signed, the data is packed up as bytecode and pushed from the senders chosen blockchain node to the rest of the blockchain.


It is the private key that protects the senders currency.  No one can create a valid transaction without signing that transaction, creating a properly signed string of bytes describing that specific transaction.


Miners gather these transactions, and, for a fee, add them to the next block mined, should they be the lucky miner that mines that block.


**A duplicate blockchain:**


Now, imagine we make an exact copy of a blockchain, as easily accessible as the rest of the blockchain.  The state of the Copy blockchain, and it's history, is exactly the same as the state of the Original blockchain, for all intents and purposes, up until the moment the next block is created on each chain.


Further, a set of miners appears to service the copy blockchain.  Further, criminals are aware of this.


The day the Copy blockchain is created, 99% of the world decides to use the new Copy blockchain, including you.  You make sure your blockchain node only talks to nodes on that chain.


For convenience, we will call the currency of the Original blockchain ETC, and the currency of the Copy blockchain ETH.


You, not having read this post, decide it would be a good idea to sell all your ETC to a stranger in exchange for USD, at five cents per ETC.  


So you fire up a second computer, with a different blockchain node, and make sure it only talks to the Original blockchain.  You copy your private keys to that computer, and sell all your ETC to that stranger for five cents per ETC.  


Hey, it's not a big deal, right?  You don't care about ETC, really. You are just making a few extra bucks.  What you really care about is that ETH you need to use to pay off your house and buy Unicorns with.


You pocket the 5000USD and run, grinning, to the super-expensive ice-cream store, where you buy the most expensive, and delicious, five thousand dollar ice cream ever - an ice cream that only the smartest, wealthiest people can afford.


When you get home, licking your lovely ice cream cone, you decide to check your ETH balance. 


""What the WHAT!!"", you say, dropping your ice cream into the kitty litter.  Your ETH balance is ZERO!!


But you were so smart!!!  What could have happened!!!


Well, remember that transaction you made, sending fifty million ETC to random person in exchange for five thousand US dollars?


That was signed by your private key, and uploaded to a blockchain with the same account history.  Your account is the same, the account of the criminal you sold fifty million ETC to is the same, everything is the same.


All the criminal had to do was to broadcast that same transaction to the Copy blockchain, the one with the ETH currency, and it looked valid, because it was!


The realization dawns upon you.  All that effort you put into understanding blockchain tech, the good luck you had to be an early adopter.  It's all gone...leaving you only with the sad, sticky ice cream that remains on your sad hand to show for it.  


It tastes terrible.  Your cat, Mr. Sparkles, thinks you are crazy and moves out.  When you are evicted, a more sensible person moves in.  Mr. Sparkles is adopted by the new owner, who buys him a Unicorn. :(

Congratulations on Ethereum giving birth!,"The basic steps of evolution are:

1. Reproduce

3. Compete
4. Repeat

With the hard fork Ethereum has taken the first two steps. It is now on step three.

Maybe immutability is the more important trait. Maybe being able to correct problems is. Either way, there will exist a version of Ethereum that has the right answer.

If cryptocurrencies continue to split and compete like this then they will adapt and evolve. I don't know if any of the existing cryptocurrencies have what it takes to take over the global currency market, but eventually one that can will arise. By forking, cryptocurrencies can adapt in ways that no traditional currency ever can.

A Grab Bag of Thoughts on ETC and Forks,"1) Three months ago I made [a statement](https://backchannel.com/the-uncanny-mind-that-built-ethereum-9b448dc9d14f#.5e1mm1fcj) in an interview with Morgen Peck as follows:

> I generally support just about every secession attempt that comes along,” he says. “If in the future there is that kind of a dispute in Ethereum, I’d definitely be quite happy to see Ethereum A go in one direction and Ethereum B go the other.

I **do** have principles, and this is a principle that I have so far held consistently. It would of course be grossly hypocritical for me to (correctly) [decry bitcoin maximalism](https://blog.ethereum.org/2014/11/20/bitcoin-maximalism-currency-platform-network-effects/) back in 2014, and then start shouting ""one chain to rule them all! network effects!"" the moment it becomes suitable to me. Rather, I believe, just as I had stated [in my 2014 post on silos](https://blog.ethereum.org/2014/12/31/silos/), that:

> If there truly is one consensus mechanism that is best, why should we not have a large merger between the various projects, come up with the best kind of decentralized computer to push forward as a basis for the crypto-economy, and move forward together under one unified system? In some respects, this seems noble; “fragmentation” certainly has undesirable properties, and it is natural to see “working together” as a good thing. In reality, however, while more cooperation is certainly useful, and this blog post will later describe how and why, desires for extreme consolidation or winner-take-all are to a large degree **exactly wrong** – not only is fragmentation not all that bad, but rather it’s inevitable, and arguably the only way that this space can reasonably prosper.

I personally admittedly find ETC's social contract, community and raison d'être less exciting and satisfying and would not personally feel the same passion for it that I do for ETH, but this is simply my judgement, and the judgement of the very many members of the community that have voted or otherwise expressed assent to the fork. Anyone who feels sufficiently strongly in the other direction is welcome to focus on the ETC chain, and we will see if it remains viable.

2) But those were just my beliefs and intermediate values. How do we know that this ""let a hundred flowers bloom"" position is actually correct? We can actually discover a lot of facts from the current situation. First of all, though we can see that the price of ETH + ETC has been remarkably stable around $14.3 for the past 2.5 days, despite great volatility in each component. This is still early-stage, but suggests that the value of at least the cryptocurrency component of the ecosystem actually isn't a superlinear function that favors monopoly.

Second, we can see from several sources (including exchange order books, but also public pronouncements [from Barry Silbert](https://twitter.com/barrysilbert/status/757628841938472961) et al) that incoming interest into ETC is actually coming from the bitcoin side even more than it is from the ethereum side. And this is a core tenet of blockchain pluralism: by leaving open an option to join an alternate system if an individual so chooses, you can satisfy the varying needs of larger groups of people.

3) I may as well offer my own views on hard forking. I **do not** believe that using hard forks as a primary paradigm to resolve thefts or to deal with unethical applications is a long-term viable strategy. This time, we got very lucky that the stolen DAO ETH were conveniently stuck in a known address for 35 days. Next time around, the funds will likely be being sold on exchanges before the developers even know it, and the only solution will be a rollback - and Casper will make rollbacks infeasible due to its economic finality mechanism in any case.

3b) ""Evil dapps"" can constantly move their contracts around in ways that evade a necessarily slow-moving hard fork, so while we can annoy them, ""softer"" means of mitigating the harm of such applications must necessarily still be sought out.

3c) The blockchain itself is very far from the eventual vision of a hyper-scalable, efficient and secure world computer and will see several more iterations to move closer to that goal; if you wish you may view Casper as a completely independent blockchain that happens to have a 100% state-copying premine from ETH, and in fact this may even be the cleanest way to implement it in code. I personally was okay with a fork in light of this context, together with a philosophical belief that **a principle does not need to have literally infinite weight in order to have value**.

In the near to mid-term future, I expect that there will be many small applications rather than one big application, and so no single failure will be enough to greatly impact the ecosystem; hence it strikes me as quite unlikely that application rescue hard forks will become a regular thing (note that some disagree; Vlad would love to have hard forks for many more things, though I'll let him defend his own views :) )

At this point, I am hypothetically open to two kinds of application rescue hard forks:

i) A fork in the very unlikely case that the Solidity compiler proves to have a serious bug that puts 5-10 million ETH in danger.  
ii) There has been a medium amount of ether that has been sent to unspendable addresses because users were using buggy ethereum-js libraries that created the address from the public key incorrectly. I would be OK with a change, for example as part of metropolis, that adds a new transaction type that effectively makes the most common categories of such unspendable addresses spendable by their cryptographically provable rightful owners (but I would only be ok with this with broad consensus and even still it's dependent on technical feasibility and tradeoffs in code complexity).

In the future, I suspect that both possibilities will recede over time.

3d) In the short and medium term, we are still under conditions of high technical uncertainty. For example, Vlad and I continue to argue about whether or not a fixed currency supply can offer sufficient incentives through transaction fees alone to secure the network. If we had agreed, for example, to a ""100 million ETH and never a single bit more"" principle on day one, we would have dug ourselves into a rather deep hole if the research ends up showing that low inflation (or something more complex, like _expected_ low deflation but the possibility of low inflation under conditions of low Casper participation) is the only safe way forward. Similarly, ""it is possible to create a contract that lasts forever"" is also something that is economically dangerous to commit to. Hence, principles on these kinds of matters may need to be settled only later.

4) Concerns about moral hazard are, in this case, IMO overblown; on the contrary, despite the fork, I have been extremely impressed by the sheer number of formal verification and other secure contract programming projects that have recently emerged in academia. Writing this from inside the middle of an Ethereum research workshop in Cornell, I am very optimistic that the number of bugs in code will decrease greatly over the next year.

4b) This does however mean that there is now a much larger burden on high-level language developers, and I personally do not have the time or ability to maintain Serpent at a level that I personally find satisfactory. I am personally continuing to use it as a language for experimenting with Casper simulations, but I welcome proposals from the community for how and if it can find a niche in other contexts.",457.0,2016-07-26 18:19:33,0.86
Mass Migration to a new Ethereum Discussion platform?,"I have heard a lot about the coming of *Ethereal.cloud* and *AKASHA.world* amongst others, and I am wondering when we can have fruitful discussions again (like we did not too long ago) about exciting new development on top of the Ethereum Network, development for a better and more efficent world.

Donating ETC to the ethereum foundation?,"With ETC's market cap approaching $100M, I assume the Ethereum Dev's will want to liquidate any foundation-related account on the un-forked chain. This seems like a once in a lifetime opportunity to gain millions in development funds without actually diminishing anyone's supply of ETH. So this post is more directed to the Dev's -- will you accept ETC donations? If so should we use the same donation address as on the forked chain? ",25.0,2016-07-26 15:14:47,0.74
"The replay attacks vulnerability is a serious one, and should definitely be addressed by the leadership.","Firstly, very grateful for the Dev team, for the incredible work they've done in Ethereum, and their high level of professionalism through some very stressful times.

In regard to the subject at hand, I say this in neutrality- the official Dev team should make a statement about replay attacks. Perhaps give a recommendation on people only using one chain or the other (with no other currency of the other type (Ethereum vs Ethereum classic) unless they really know what they're doing.

Perhaps it would be wise to also come out and say which is primarily supported. I don't think its feasible to support both chains equally - by the way, supporting both chains essentially doubles the amount of support thats needed and opens up an enormous can of worms.

Clearly, this wasn't the intention or the expectation of almost anyone, and none of us can read the future with 100% clarity, we can only adapt. But Ethereum is evolving to the point where, now that we have a market cap of $1 Billion, sooner or later people are going to start realizing this is real money.

I understand the desire to stay impartial, but at a certain point, you need to mitigate security risks and keep the project cohesive.

One question I ask is: So the community majority decided to move forward with the fork (and for those who didn't vote that's their fault, just like if one doesn't vote for their elected officials or anything else in life).  -- So then shouldn't it be the foundations responsibility to serve the community? On this note, some will argue that EVERYONE didn't want the hardfork. Well is EVERYONE going to agree on everything? No. Are we going to have to support a million different chains because of different things people believe in? 

Once again, the rise of Ethereum classic has created a serious security risk, I think we were hoping this issue would blow over on its own, but it hasn't. Every day this vulnerability exists, is another day users are at risk, and are getting fleeced. Thus it is the responsible thing to do to protect your userbase, and at the very least clearly warn against the vulnerability and try to deter users from making themselves vulnerable. A statement is probably a good start.

Finally, there are other risks too such as scammers selling ""cheap Ethereum"" which is really Ethereum classic to unknowing or disconnected Ethereum users (who might just quickly check the price). In the name of security this should quickly and promptly be addressed to avoid future suffering by unknowing users. That is all.

Once again, thank you to the devs, and I'm sorry you guys have to go through these stressful times and decision making. I could only suggest that you meditate, be thoughtful and conscious, try to do the right thing in your leadership positions. God bless!

A call for Solidarity,"I'm going to keep this post as short and concise as possible.

As I said the day after the DAO attack ~ 2 months ago, our community needs to stick together.

At this point the hard fork has come and gone, thus, we need to stick together to the chain that the majority of miners (and majority of Ethereum holders as seen by polls) agreed on.

People are welcome to disagree, but there are different subreddits they can go to gather on, just like there are different subreddits for each altcoin with their philosophies and views.

This attacking of the main chain here on this Reddit though is very toxic and needs to stop, it reminds me way too much of after the DAO debacle and this is something that needs to be put in the past once and for all.


I've seen a lot of toxic posters here in the past day so I may not respond to people as it has worn me out and I'm trying to take a break from this right now, but I thought to get this out there.

**Edit - Some clarification: I want to state that I (obviously) don't mind at all general Ethereum discussion that can relate to Ethereum alongside any fork of it.

"Regarding the value of the ""Ethereum classic"" network.","There are other Ethereum clones out there, like Expanse, and others, some with market caps as low as $100k, or less.

So what gives a network its value?-- seeing as how many of these clones are virtually identical to Ethereum? On that note, what about the Bitcoin clones? We know plenty of those with market caps of sub $10,000 (or simply dead) -- even though they function almost identically to Bitcoin.

The answer is, the network. The number of people using it. Refer to https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_effect

I don't think more than a small fraction of people are going to end up using Ethereum classic, for this reason alone, we could argue the value of Ethereum classic should be perhaps 1/100 of Ethereum's, if not less.

I think the main reasons the price hasn't collapsed yet is most people haven't figured out how to sell their ETC yet, and a 51% attack hasn't occurred yet.

Wherever it makes sense to do so, the ""true"" version of any deployed contract related to the Digix or Maker contract systems should be interpreted as residing on Ethereum (ETH) ""pro-fork"" chain. Any system updates will proceed as planned on ETH.

We are not responsible for any ETC stolen via replay attacks against our systems. Users are encouraged to be cautious of replays on ETC and to use a splitting contract such as the one published by Kraken to preserve any ETC they care about.

We discourage any attacks on ETC and encourage everyone to keep calm and not act emotionally. Our attitude towards ETC is the same as our attitude towards Rootstock was: it is useful for our dapps to the extent that we can perform cross-chain logic to interact with their ecosystem.

Ethereum is plenty secure. An ACID compliant database it is not.,"Old timer here, and enthusiastic yet cautious Ethereum newbie.  Among my jobs in the 20 or so years I've been working in dot-coms, SQL developer and DBA were two of them. After watching theDAO fiasco and following as many of the threads as best as I could, the biggest problem that has stuck out to me is that Ethereum is trying to handle million dollar balances that are managed by functions that increment and decrement variable states across contracts and then pretend that, somehow, this resembles a ""real transaction"".  Before you knee-jerk into a bloody lip, let me provide this analogy: theDAO's code, the exploit, and the suggested solutions has been like watching someone try to write an accounting system with Java that uses flat files for persistence, then having others blame the language that it isn't ""secure"" enough after some errant and necessarily complicated code corrupts account balances between the files after an abundantly obvious race condition(s). It's patently absurd.  

In relational databases, balances are often calculations of committed and atomic transactions, each carefully protected by ROLLBACK clauses in their procedural programming. Typically where real money is involved, roll-up balances are calculated in batch by some transaction count or by elapsed time, say a 24 hour period. This isolates problems to one batch of transactions, limiting the risk to account state to that period.  Neither Solidity the language nor Ethereum's blockchain as a database of persistence has the means necessary to implement any of this type of very basic functionality that is well known to any IT developer working in a Finance department. To be fair, I would never write an ecommerce system on top of a NOSQL database, either, yet many have and will continue to do so. That's their prerogative. 

Call me old and prejudiced but, I fear that many in the community are barking up the wrong grove of trees while attempting to reinvent one of the most tried true, and trusted wheels of computing history: the ACID compliant database. Sure, you could keep chasing this idea about formal verification and insisting on some arcane functional programming language to write ""contracts"" in.  But I would avoid that approach for the same reasons that the industry has trusted and demonstrably proven to be effective in the processing hundreds of billions of dollars of ecommerce in the last two decades with lowly tools like PHP, Perl, and MySQL rather than  insist on only hiring  missile guidance engineers that refuse to work with  anything but RTOS: it's massive overkill. 

My suggestion to Ethcore devs:  

1) figure out how to model transactional COMMITs, and/or an ACID compliant storage type in Swarm. 

2) add provisions for BEGIN TRAN / COMMIT / ROLLBACK features to take advantage of 1) directly in Solidity.  

A third option might be to run a side project to port Sqlite3 as a pluggable component to Eth, sort of how people are using IPFS. Maybe it isn't as cool, but it's reliable.

The crowdfunder danger,"A couple of days after the fork we're seeing more unlimited crowdfunders. The hype train is about to start again with people throwing money into projects they don't understand and sales pitches that are incomplete.

*Learn from The DAO. It's not just the final exploit that was the problem, it had many others people were blinding themselves to issues due to the hype/investment. If you're going to put money into something, you're probably going to lose it one way or another. The problem with tokens is people assume they can always trade out or get too vested to do so. Think about that first and then, if you're happy with the risk, go ahead on that basis.*

*We had our Mulligan because of a project screw up. It's not happening again. Moreover, we need to hold companies raising funds to much higher standards.*

Can we also note that Ethereum is far from ready for larger projects. *Production ready* means we can do our experiments as the core platform is working, subject to bugs. It does not mean it's ready for operating non-simple commercial projects or large sums in contracts without huge risk because:

- We have a total lack of ethereum specific security best practices and model contracts
- The EVM and compilers *will* contain bugs which *may* cause a total failure or loss of funds
- The current version doesn't scale
- We have multiple further hard forks which carries risks

Ethereum needs another 3-5 years so please don't kid yourself that we don't.

Crowdfunders need to be taken much more seriously and should provide most or all of the below:

- Provide an explanation of the product, who it's for, how it'll be marketed, what the value proposition is and why it's better decentralised.

- Specify precisely how they are dealing with exchange rate risk. Are they converting straight away? If not, why not? Their bills are in fiat so why are they making their business take exchange rate risk or do they have a suitable methodology to maintain a healthy Ether/USD/BTC balance?

- Provide proper, reasonable long term financial projections. They're always going to be somewhat made up but they must have a semblance of reasoning behind them.

- Provide a detailed explanation of planned expenditure. Consider if it makes sense. Is there a marketing budget? PR? Are salaries reasonable? Legal expenses? General running costs?

- Provide an explanation of if/how they will raise future funding and its affect on token holders. This includes details of how much revenue will be split with token holders or whether its from profit and how this will be viewed by angels and VCs.

- Provide a proper market analysis.

- Provide a proper risk assessment.

- If they have advisors, do not consider them part of the core team and they may do nothing at all. Advisors are often used to make something look more than it is, as Andreas found out with Neo & Bee. Advisors used for marketing purposes have no value - find out what they do. 

- When people critique a project, listen to what they're saying and don't just jump to the defence of the company. Many things around the dao were *indefensible* yet still people did because they were over vested and could no longer act rationally. 

- You're investing in people more than technology. Get to know who the team are. Ask for a video pitch, AMA, team conference calls. Know their background. Are they from the sector their project is in because if not, huge red flag. 

Ask the hard questions. Don't take excuses. Check the facts stack-up. Watch how the team behaves in public.

Report back to the community with your thoughts and fears.

Then, and only then, decide whether to take the plunge.

If you haven't considered all the above, you're gambling with no idea of the odds.

Ethereum in the energy sector - A brief post about level setting community Expectations and curbing rampant speculation,"Recently, I've seen what appears to be an increase in chatter and discussion about the impact Ethereum might have in the energy sector and much of it seems to be wild speculation such as linking what Elon Musk is doing to Ethereum projects like the TransActive Grid. I'd like to briefly describe some of the work and thinking we've been doing at ConsenSys and hopefully align expectations a little closer to reality. 

I've been focused on the energy sector and the possible impacts Ethereum could have for roughly two years and continue to do so at ConsenSys, starting with the TransActive Grid project and more recently alongside RWE. As we continue to witness the energy sector start to explore and learn about Ethereum, I would strongly recommend against rampant speculation - it is irresponsible to do so imo. I believe, as a community, we should carefully think through various facets of the electrical grid and perhaps there are spots where efficiency gains can be found that Ethereum can maybe help enable, however that is very different than, for example, imagining the work Elon is doing is somehow related. The TransActive Grid is an attempt to explore new potential Ethereum enabled interactions within the context of a microgrid and so we can think of microgrids as contributing to a more resilient grid and one that is better prepared to recover from adverse events like severe weather (i.e. Hurricane Sandy in New York a few years ago). The second key factor to consider in our thinking is the notion of grid reliability which refers to a grid with fewer and shorter power interruptions and these considerations must make sense from a cost-to-serve perspective which still seems unclear at this time. 

Another point worth considering is the regulatory side wherein the grid is unlike the financial services sector because if you screw up and get it wrong, things like substations can blow up and cause very real damage. In that context, we are still in the early stages of understanding if and how Ethereum can add value to the grid and unsubstantiated speculation does the community a disservice. For more context about some of the thinking and work we've been doing at ConsenSys in this space, please have a look here;
